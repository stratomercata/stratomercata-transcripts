SPEAKER_01:
[35.5s] Welcome, guys.
[36.3s] Welcome, welcome.
[37.8s] Just waiting for Fabian to get on here.
[43.1s] Let me know if you guys have any questions or want to come up and be a part of the panel.
[65.9s] Trying to play some music, but it ain't playing.
[97.8s] Oh, there he is.
[100.6s] Okay.
[114.5s] Hi Fabian, how are you?

FABIAN VOGELSTELLER:
[119.8s] Hello.

SPEAKER_01:
[123.3s] How you doing?

FABIAN VOGELSTELLER:
[125.9s] Good.
[127.3s] I mean, good under the circumstances.

SPEAKER_01:
[132.9s] Yeah, there's always interesting stuff going on in this space.
[137.2s] It's good to finally meet you.
[139.3s] I tried to actually come to the booth at ETHDenver, and I just missed you.
[145.3s] I actually met Abru—I think Abru?
[150.6s] Very nice lady.
[151.6s] And, uh, I kept calling you Fabian, Fabian, Fabian.
[156.5s] She’s like, “That's not how you say his name.”
[160.9s] It's Fabian.
[161.8s] It's Fabian.
[162.6s] I was like, uh, I’m just an American.
[164.5s] Sorry.
[166.1s] But, um, yeah, it's great.
[167.7s] It's great.
[168.4s] Um, to finally link up and talk a bit about just you and the past and a little bit of the future. I got a bunch of, uh,
[177.9s] questions about, you know, you in general and then, uh, you know, the early days of Ethereum.
[184.5s] And then we’ll probably wrap up with a nice chunk of, you know, what you're doing now with, with LUKSO, and the Universal Profiles—if that’s all cool with you?

FABIAN VOGELSTELLER:
[196.2s] Sure.
[196.4s] Yeah.
[198.1s] So really, I just wanted to just kind of get an idea of, like, when did you actually start developing? And when—and like how and why—you got into blockchain?

FABIAN VOGELSTELLER:
[209.9s] Yeah.
[211.2s] Um, I mean I started developing when I was quite young.
[215.6s] So I started with like—with seven—I had my first computer. We got my father's old computer, I think it was a 286 PC.
[229.3s] And, um, I mean, I was basically always more interested in making the games work. You know, in the past, you had to configure the config.sys and autoexec.bat to get games running.
[238.7s] And that was always interesting.
[240.2s] And then once I had it running, I played it for five minutes and I was bored.
[243.6s] And then I went on to get the next game running.
[249.0s] Yeah, and then...
[250.8s] I mean, I've basically been web designing since pretty much 14.
[256.3s] I mean, I started with the first websites that I created for, you know, some people in my village. They had a company and in the '90s, they all wanted to—you know, I mean, they realized they had to have a website now, blah blah blah.
[269.1s] And then they heard that I could make websites.
[271.7s] And that’s how I started.
[274.6s] Over my early kind of web developer career, I just made a lot of websites.
[280.1s] And I built a content management system, which is my username in fact.
[285.1s] So if you go to findura.org, you actually still find my content management system that I built in, I think, 2005 to 2008.
[295.1s] That’s kind of how I got all into coding.
[301.2s] That was always like my private—
[303.2s] life and my hobby.
[304.3s] And I studied media design, funny enough. That was not coding.
[311.5s] That was basically everything else from, you know, movie making to audio to graphic design and whatnot.
[321.5s] Yeah.
[321.9s] So this is how I got into, you know, coding itself.

[325.1s] And in 2013, I heard about Bitcoin through one of those, you know, random posts that you see on a website.
[334.8s] It was one of these like mixed media posts you see on websites where you think this is a total scam. It said something about “A Canadian wants to sell house in Bitcoin.”
[344.8s] And I thought, okay, what is Bitcoin?
[346.2s] If somebody wants to sell his house in something I’ve never heard of, let me click on that.
[351.5s] So that was March 2013, and that was the beginning of the rabbit hole of blockchain for me.
[357.5s] I realized, okay, this is kind of like a crazy idea—a cryptographic money.
[365.2s] It’s decentralized, and all of this was completely novel at the time.
[369.2s] And I just kind of instantly got a feeling that this was a very big deal.

[374.6s] And then over the year 2013,
[378.7s] I really tried to conceptually understand how Bitcoin works.
[384.7s] That concept was quite novel in terms of decentralized infrastructure.
[390.4s] I mean, I already built websites and I knew how servers run and how everything else works on a computer.
[395.3s] But you always had to have a central place where logic is processed.
[401.4s] Either it's a computer or it’s a server—something needs to decide how this stuff
[406.9s] has to work.
[408.3s] And here, the idea was that you have this distributed computer network and somehow they agree to what the system does.
[416.2s] And it took me quite a while, actually—
[418.0s] I mean, within the year 2013, every month I thought, okay, now I understand it.
[425.3s] I had always these revelation moments—“Ah, that’s how it works!”
[429.9s] But I had like twelve of those in that year.
[432.8s] And every time again I felt like—now I get it.
[438.1s] But yeah, I already felt like this was a big deal.
[441.9s] So I kind of took my little extra €200 a month that I had and put them in Bitcoin, just because I knew this would be big.
[454.3s] I mean, this was 2013.
[456.3s] When I joined, it was March.
[458.4s] Literally the month later, it went from $10 to $260, only to go back to $60 over the next three months, then only to go back up to $1,200.
[469.2s] So it was kind of like a compressed version of the bubbles of today.
[473.0s] It was the exact same kind of flow—except highly compressed.
[478.8s] Because everything happened in pretty much just a year, you know, from up-down to down-up.
[487.7s] Yeah, this was the pre-Ethereum world.
[491.0s] When I joined in March, and in July—I think two months later—came the first kind of Bitcoin clones.
[497.3s] Because people realized, oh wow, I can also make Bitcoin.
[509.3s] Fork that, give it a different name, maybe change a little bit of things.
[513.2s] And that was Litecoin.

[515.6s] And then people started to clone Bitcoin.
[518.8s] Some were actually a bit more creative. There was a project called NXT.
[523.5s] That was kind of like a mini version of Ethereum. It had a lot of functionality—you could create a colored coin, or assets (how they called it, like the tokens of today). You could even trade them all on the same blockchain.
[538.5s] And they did all of this through a different kind of transaction type that they introduced into their proof-of-stake network.
[546.6s] And they also had a quite sophisticated interface.
[548.6s] So this was kind of interesting to see.
[550.5s] All of this pretty much happened within months, by the way.

[555.6s] Then in—I think it was 2014...
[564.0s] Was it 2014?
[565.4s] No, 2013.
[565.9s] Yeah, I think it was already 2013—Mastercoin came up with the idea of instead of creating a new blockchain, you could just encode new types of protocol inside the Bitcoin blockchain.
[580.5s] Then you could create colored coins on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.
[585.8s] I think that's also the idea—like, this is also what inspired Vitalik to create Ethereum.

[591.7s] And I found Mastercoin quite interesting from a conceptual point of view.
[597.3s] And then, end of 2013, Vitalik proposed the Ethereum whitepaper.
[603.6s] And I mean, I heard of it.
[606.8s] I kind of felt it was really a novel idea.
[610.9s] It sounded kind of complicated—to make a whole virtual machine running on a blockchain—
[619.1s] but it sounded like a big idea.
[623.2s] So yeah, I followed that.

[625.4s] Basically, in 2014—shortly before they made their ICO—I met the guys from Ethereum here in Berlin at a coworking space opening.
[640.0s] And I kind of realized that what they wanted to do was a really cool idea, but they had no one who could build the applications.
[649.4s] The idea was, “We make the network and then the rest—the people—come by themselves.”
[660.8s] And I had written a book about Meteor.js, which is a JavaScript framework that allowed you to build single-page applications.
[670.1s] And I just really felt that was the perfect fit here—because you could build a JavaScript application that purely runs on your frontend,
[677.2s] and then it could basically talk to this blockchain as the backend.

(Transcript continues in next completion...)

SPEAKER_00:
[1051.2s] And within three months, we had the first working version of the Mist Browser, which is actually, in hindsight, a completely impossible task.
[1061.8s] That was achieved here.
[1064.8s] Because the tooling was so—I mean, non-existent, basically.
[1068.9s] So there was pretty much only Solidity.
[1070.5s] There was Web3.js in its very early version.
[1073.3s] It was started by, I think, Jeffrey, and then Gavin continued it, and then Marek came in, who was supposed to be developing this library.
[1081.8s] For the people who don't know what Web3.js is, it's basically kind of like this little library that you use in the middle.
[1088.0s] So if you're a JavaScript developer, you know JavaScript, right?
[1090.4s] You don't know Solidity and you don't know how to speak to the EVM.
[1093.8s] And Web3.js is doing exactly that kind of translation.
[1097.0s] So that in your code, you can just call functions, like on an object—like you would do in JavaScript—but it translates it to EVM bytecode so that the smart contract on the end can understand it.
[1108.8s] And that was in its very early days and also very confusingly written.
[1112.6s] I mean, the API was quite confusing too.
[1115.8s] And that was kind of like the main tool.
[1118.2s] And then we put that into that browser.
[1121.1s] And yeah, I mean, we basically—you know, there was no...
[1128.3s] standard way of how a dapp would interact with a smart contract.
[1132.4s] There was nothing yet there.
[1134.2s] It was all just us making it up, basically.
[1138.0s] And Web3.js kind of was the middleman.
[1141.2s] So we injected that object into a dapp.
[1145.3s] When you load an app in this browser, we injected this Web3 object in.
[1148.8s] And the idea was, OK, now dapps can use this Web3 object to talk to smart contracts like it's a JavaScript object.
[1157.0s] That kind of later became—this injected object—kind of later became the Ethereum provider.
[1164.5s] That's how MetaMask, you know, and other extensions, for example, and apps talk to the dapp.
[1173.0s] But yeah, you had to basically figure everything out with Mist.
[1176.2s] I didn't listen to the space with Alex, but he probably already explained all of that too, I guess.
[1182.0s] So probably a lot of overlap here.

SPEAKER_01:
[1184.7s] Yeah, yeah, there is.
[1186.3s] I just wanted to get a bit of different perspectives, because I know Alex was a bit on the different side of things, whereas he didn't really code as much, but he put together the team and some of the thought process behind things, whereas you were more like the coder and developer of things.

SPEAKER_00:
[1207.3s] Yeah.
[1208.0s] I mean, he was the visionary, you know. He had the idea with the Mist Browser and, you know, he was a great UX designer.
[1215.2s] So he basically built all the front ends and the interfaces and put them all into something existing.
[1221.3s] And yeah, I mean, then basically the first dapp that we built was a wallet—
[1228.0s] It was the Ethereum Wallet.
[1230.8s] And because people wanted to have that wallet before we had the browser fully ready, we even packaged a version that kind of like just loaded the wallet without the browser part.
[1239.1s] But on the end, it was the exact same code base.
[1241.5s] And that's why there's like this notion of a Mist Browser and Mist Wallet.
[1245.9s] And it was all confusing for people because they were pretty much similar, but kind of different.
[1252.4s] So there was the version that you could download—the Mist Browser—where the wallet was one app, or you could have the prepackaged, you know, just the wallet.
[1260.7s] And it was one of the better looking wallets out there.
[1266.6s] I mean, at the time, you know—I mean definitely—everything was pretty ugly looking at the time.
[1271.9s] And, I mean, you could interact with smart contracts.
[1275.5s] And then Alex came up with the idea to make a generic kind of a page where you could just load any smart contract.
[1282.0s] And based on the ABI, it would completely display you like input fields for the functions—
[1287.3s] so you could just interact with the smart contract right from an interface.
[1292.1s] And yeah, I mean, the Mist Browser was pretty much in use from the beginning of the network
[1300.0s] up until like—I mean, pretty busy in use for a year after that, or one and a half years after that.
[1307.7s] The problem that happened is because we wanted to try the full-on decentralized way, meaning
[1313.9s] the app was actually running a full node under the hood.
[1316.8s] So when you're running it, it would actually spin up a Geth node under the hood, which then synchronizes the blockchain.
[1323.3s] And when it synchronized the blockchain, we popped up the interface, you know, and then it could do stuff.
[1329.5s] So the longer the chain got, the slower the synchronization process was.
[1333.6s] And obviously, if you were not using the Mist Browser for a few weeks, then, you know, the synchronization was
[1340.5s] a little slower.
[1343.4s] Hence, the user experience was not great.
[1346.5s] And that kind of inspired, you know, Koumarios from MetaMask to create MetaMask.
[1352.8s] You know, he wanted to make the less decentralized version as a browser extension, which just used an RPC endpoint—an external one—so you don't have to synchronize the whole node.
[1364.3s] And yeah, in a way, you know, MetaMask was an answer to the Mist Browser—a way to make it a bit more user-friendly,
[1370.7s] while we tried to do it the full-on decentralized way, you know, and see how well this can work.
[1378.6s] One interesting thing is that in 2016, The DAO happened—the first decentralized autonomous organization, or the first bigger DAO.
[1390.6s] And the main interface for The DAO was literally the Mist Browser, because you could load in the DAO contract and you got this interface where you could interact with
[1399.6s] the DAO.
[1400.4s] So they used that—our Mist Browser—as kind of like the frontend for it.
[1406.8s] Yeah, and then that blew up.
[1409.0s] So it split the network in two, in a way.
[1412.1s] Yeah, the Mist Browser was like an essential part of the Ethereum history.
[1419.6s] It was kind of the first one and a half years of discovering smart contracts.
[1425.1s] And I think what it did is—not only was it the wallet for everybody
[1429.5s] at the time—but it also inspired all the developers and dapps that came after that because they kind of literally wanted to be at a similar UX level on par with the Mist Browser.
[1443.9s] So I think we kind of leveled the game a little bit, or we lifted up the level of, you know, what people build.
[1449.7s] It was not so nerdy-looking like an old-school Windows 3.11, you know, window or whatever, but it was a bit cooler looking.
[1458.7s] Yeah, and we kind of paved the way for how you build dapps.
[1466.4s] I built some example dapps and example modules and tools you could use in dapps, and I made videos explaining how you build dapps.
[1477.2s] I was kind of figuring it all out and then explaining it to others—how you do all of this stuff, basically.

SPEAKER_01:
[1486.5s] Yeah, that's so interesting.
[1487.7s] It was just—it was more, you know, laying the tracks as you were going—like as the airplane was in the sky, you were making adjustments, which is difficult.
[1499.7s] And I know Vitalik has kind of, you know, talked about that a bit when it comes to building Ethereum—like the plane's in the sky already, you know, it's—
[1510.3s] it's kind of hard to adjust at times while this thing is already moving.
[1517.0s] So yeah, that's really great.
[1520.6s] And I know you alluded to The DAO, but did you know that Alex actually tried to start a little DAO with Mist like a year before The DAO?
[1533.5s] And there's a GitHub page for it too and everything.
[1536.1s] And I even talked to Alex about it.
[1537.8s] I was like, hey, remember you tried to start a DAO with MistCoin?
[1541.1s] And he's like, I don't even remember that.

SPEAKER_00:
[1544.2s] I mean, yeah, I was there, obviously.
[1547.4s] I mean, what he did is basically he built some example contracts
[1551.7s] as kind of like little example code snippets and put them on the Ethereum website.
[1557.5s] He just wanted to show people what can be done with smart contracts, and one example was like a voting contract—like a DAO, basically.
[1566.5s] That was one of the examples on the Ethereum website.
[1570.7s] Yeah, I mean with the Mist Browser you could have an interface for it. And I mean, this definitely inspired The DAO.
[1576.7s] Yeah, I mean, that example contract certainly inspired Christoph Jentzsch, who then later built The DAO.
[1584.1s] Yeah, I mean, it was just not used.
[1585.9s] There was no DAO that was kind of like, you know, published and voted on.
[1589.9s] It was just basically the first kind of code of it.
[1593.4s] No, yeah.

SPEAKER_01:
[1593.9s] I mean, it just adds further to the history and the lore of what was, you know, trying to be kind of implemented or played around with by, you know, you guys with MistCoin and just, you know, the beginning iterations of all these new ideas.

SPEAKER_00:
[1611.0s] I mean, everything was already like, you know, this is the thing. Like, when people talk about NFTs or tokens or DAOs—I mean, these ideas, they were around since pretty much the beginning.
[1633.5s] And we did the early experiments and play-around and explanation videos and all of this stuff and, you know, code examples just to—
[1635.8s] Yeah, show what's possible.
[1647.5s] But it obviously took a long time for people to really finally build all the more sophisticated versions out—that on the end were used by thousands of people.
[1653.7s] Like The DAO, for example—that was kind of a bit unexpectedly fast-growing.
[1655.9s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_01:
[1657.1s] All right.
[1658.3s] Now for the juicy question—when was the
[1663.4s] inspiration or thought process—or what was the inspiration or thought process into creating the ERC-20 standard?
[1673.2s] Did you reference any like pieces of prior development or use any pieces of research to do so?
[1680.7s] Or was it more of just like bouncing ideas and conversations back and forth with like you and Vitalik or some other developer?

SPEAKER_00:
[1688.0s] Yeah, I mean, so basically what happened here is—
[1694.0s] that Vitalik—I mean, people wanted to make tokens on Ethereum.
[1698.4s] There were like demands for that.
[1700.1s] And then Vitalik—we had these kind of wiki pages in Ethereum.
[1704.7s] And Vitalik wrote like a wiki page called—I think he called it “Standard ABI Contracts” or whatever. You know, he gave it some weird name.
[1713.8s] And he wrote three kind of standard or basic ideas of a standard.
[1718.2s] One was the token standard.
[1720.3s] The other one was some kind of registry thing.
[1724.6s] I forgot what the third one was.
[1726.3s] So we had this discussion internally, you know—some people from the community and basically people from within Ethereum—and we discussed this.
[1736.4s] And at the time, Martin Becze actually created a repository in Ethereum GitHub,
[1743.2s] and they called it EIP.
[1745.1s] And his idea was to make Ethereum Improvement Proposals, right?
[1748.3s] So that we can evolve the chain.
[1749.8s] And Martin was really just focused on, you know, the consensus development.
[1754.4s] And, you know, he wanted to introduce WASM instead of the EVM.
[1757.9s] And so his idea was to have like this place where improvement proposals can be proposed.
[1763.2s] That happened pretty much exactly the same time
[1766.6s] when, you know, when ERC-20 happened.
[1769.0s] And so I thought, OK, that's actually a great place to kind of put this out there—
[1775.4s] what Vitalik here initially drafted—and have a proper discussion.
[1780.8s] I took this example and I created a document in the EIP space and I called it ERC—Ethereum Request for Comment.
[1790.5s] This is based on this RFC process—Request for Comment—in the web standards.
[1797.3s] And I just changed a few little things, even changed a bit the order on some function names, and put it in the proper specification.
[1804.0s] So kind of my work was to put it in a proper format, let's say.
[1809.7s] And then the discussion really started to shift over there and pretty much 60
[1817.9s] some people started discussing. And basically, in the end, we didn't change much, but we just had a bunch of back-and-forth—over 300 comments.
[1826.3s] And then people started really implementing it this way.
[1828.7s] And for example, I was not fully in agreement with all the functions.
[1832.3s] For example, I was not a fan of this transferFrom and approve functions.
[1836.4s] I thought we should actually notify the smart contract and not just allow an external contract to then pull in money.
[1845.5s] That's why when I created the MistCoin—which was basically just the idea of, OK, let me just make an example token so we can test it out in the Mist Browser, because we needed a token to test it in our interfaces—
[1859.0s] and I just thought, OK, let me just create one on the mainnet.
[1862.3s] And I specifically created it without those functions that I didn’t like.
[1867.5s] Hence why the original MistCoin doesn't have the approve and transferFrom function,
[1872.8s] which then makes it nowadays incompatible with Uniswap, and hence why it needed to be wrapped.
[1879.2s] It needed to be wrapped so it gets these transferFrom functions.
[1882.9s] I created this while we were discussing and in this wiki page with Vitalik—I created this example token just to test around and play around with it.
[1895.1s] Then two weeks later, I actually created the ERC draft—like the specification issue.
[1900.9s] And it was just the issue number 20.
[1902.6s] So I just created an issue.
[1904.1s] It happened to be number 20.
[1905.9s] And I called it Ethereum Request for Comment.
[1908.9s] And yeah, that kind of became later the standard name.
[1912.3s] That was never the intention at all.
[1915.7s] And my, you know, little test token there was just sitting around on my wallet, like as a little historical aspect.
[1927.8s] And already in the early days, there were some people—we sent it to some people just for fun, just to also test the Mist Browser interface and the wallet and show people that, you know, you can see these tokens and how it works.
[1940.4s] So Alex gave some out for free.
[1943.2s] You know, we just like spread it.
[1945.8s] And then over the years, other people came to me and asked, “Hey, can I have some? I would really collect”—

(Transcript continues beyond this cut.)

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[1950.9s] And I really didn't care much, honestly, um, because it was just a test token, really.
[1956.9s] Um, but that was also the whole, the whole ERC-20 explosion kind of started, um, pretty much.

[1966.5s] So in November 2017, I kind of put that proposal up there and—
[1973.0s] what it really made possible for people is: there were the days of the ICO.
[1978.3s] So people wanted to make ICOs.
[1980.1s] And suddenly, there was the possibility that you could create a token on Ethereum with very little effort, and you could technically fundraise with this. It was the idea of many people—without needing to create your own blockchain and everything.
[1995.7s] Which also had the caveat that you needed to figure out what your token does—which is probably the downside of many of the ICOs later; they didn’t really have a proper purpose, I guess.

[2011.9s] But it exploded, really.
[2013.4s] Basically, four or five months after that—
[2018.0s] after the ERC-20 proposal, it really started to kind of, like, you know, go bananas.
[2024.0s] And hence why, in 2016 and 2017 and 2018, we had all of these crazy ICO boom cycles, with eventually billions of dollars—hundreds of billions of dollars—being raised in—
[2041.7s] Yeah, ICOs, pretty much.

[2045.3s] And actually, funny enough, you know, like, I didn’t even correlate all of this ICO stuff and all of this to me at all, until Florian Glatz from Common Ground told me—“Hey Fabian, actually,” we sat in the car once, and he told me, “Do you realize that you created ERC-20 and with that, all of this became—like—
[2067.1s] possible?”

[2068.1s] And that was like in 2016, some more—or later, actually.
[2071.1s] And that was the first time that I kind of even realized this, because I didn’t really think about it that much honestly—that this was somehow correlated.
[2084.3s] Yeah, that’s the early-day story.

SPEAKER_01:
[2087.7s] Yeah, so when it came to the ERC-20 standard, you were saying that it was like a group of—there was actually, like, a wiki page and a group of like 60 people that were talking back and forth and kind of like collaborating on, you know, figuring out the standard?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2104.8s] I mean, the initial proposal was actually from Vitalik, and then we just—I just changed a few things.
[2111.3s] So the proposal was pretty much Vitalik’s idea in its initial form.
[2115.6s] And we then just discussed—I mean, I made a little bit of changes and I brought it into a format that, you know, allowed people to understand how it works and everything else, because he had just thrown together things quickly in a wiki page.

[2129.9s] And then after that, the conversations happened—you know, there was back and forth on certain aspects of it, but ultimately when we kind of, um, kind of agreed to a more or less
[2143.1s] solid version, it didn’t change that much. I mean, there were a few things added, but it didn’t change massively from the initial idea.

[2152.6s] The fun fact is that it wasn’t finalized until 2017.
[2157.5s] So I only really moved it from draft to final in, I think, September 2017.

SPEAKER_01:
[2163.8s] Wow.
[2164.4s] Okay.
[2164.9s] Yeah, that way—
[2165.7s] Yeah.
[2165.9s] I didn’t know that.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2166.9s] It was way, way, way after it was massively adopted—that it even moved into the final state.
[2172.7s] Why?
[2173.0s] Because I thought that was the point where it’s definitely not going to change anymore.
[2176.9s] I mean, it was so widely used that the chances that it’s going to change—zero.
[2182.1s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_01:
[2182.6s] Yeah.
[2183.2s] Did you believe like that standard—
[2186.6s] Maybe?
[2187.2s] I don’t know if it was like, let’s say 2015 when you were writing it—
[2190.9s] Did you believe that the ERC-20 standard would achieve the relevance that it did and be as big as it is here?
[2198.5s] You didn’t think that?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2200.2s] No, not at all.
[2201.2s] I mean, in fact, I didn’t even care at all.
[2203.2s] I mean, I knew people wanted to make tokens. I didn’t expect that this specific standard would make it. And even—there was no standardization process.
[2217.0s] There was not even the idea that we need to now talk about smart contract standards.
[2220.0s] I mean, it was just that people wanted to make tokens.
[2223.0s] So we came up with some, you know, way of how you can make tokens.
[2228.2s] And that’s what it was. Only in hindsight later,

[2234.7s] it was clear that this was the first smart contract standard. On top of this, the most successful one.
[2244.5s] And on top of this, that's the process of how you have to do this—you now come together, you create your own standards, and then people, if they’re using it, it becomes an actual standard.
[2250.1s] And then, you know, this is what’s needed for an EVM chain. There was no—this was not really clear at all.
[2251.9s] I mean, we had no idea.
[2254.3s] There was no process or anything.
[2255.8s] It just was made up as we went.

SPEAKER_01:
[2259.7s] So basically you said it wasn’t really finalized until September 2017. And then a few months later, that’s when the ERC-721 was finalized as a standard, correct?
[2273.3s] Or did 721 also take…

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2278.2s] So the thing—yeah, 721 was actually created in, I think, October 2017.
[2284.1s] So that was even after that.
[2286.0s] So the thing is, when basically the ICO wave kind of flattened down a little bit—or crashed—then people kind of moved on and thought, hey, what else can you do with tokens other than just, like, numbers.

[2297.3s] I mean, the ideas of NFTs were nothing new—like, that you could authenticate things on a blockchain and that you can
[2305.4s] make unique things—that was already around. But people were so busy creating ICOs and investing in ICOs, I guess, that really, there was all the focus.

[2316.1s] So there was some like—and then yeah, pretty much in 2017 when this came, when the hype slowed down a little bit, that’s when these other ideas became a bit more, you know, in the focus.
[2330.5s] And then there were people who thought, okay, let’s create—
[2333.7s] you know, an NFT standard.

[2335.1s] And even before 721—which on the end, 721 is a fairly simple modification of ERC-20, because it only really changed the token amount that you transfer to a token ID.
[2350.2s] And they did some other modifications to introduce, for example, notifying another smart contract.
[2357.5s] They introduced that as well. But also, this came actually out of earlier improvements.

[2364.4s] So basically after it was created and right after it had started to become popular, there were people thinking—hey, we need to improve this token standard because it was not perfect.
[2374.8s] The whole idea that you needed to use `approve` and `transferFrom`—it was a total hack.
[2379.1s] I mean, I never liked it. Because it was a hack. But the agreement back in the day when we wrote it was:
[2392.5s] “Okay, we don’t know what people can build on a smart contract blockchain, and we don’t know what’s best practice in such a system.
[2399.2s] And before we make a mistake and people lose money, let’s do the most safe way we can do.”
[2400.8s] Which means—just approve a contract, and then
[2400.8s] this contract can move it.
[2400.8s] If we had notified another contract after a transaction happened, that could lead to all kinds of other potential vulnerabilities that we just were not fully understanding at the time. Hence why we didn’t go with that approach.

[2413.5s] Even though that was the right approach to take. Hence why all these improvement proposals came after.

[2422.9s] There was a standard called ERC-223.
[2424.5s] I mean, guess what—it’s 200 standards later.
[2429.5s] By the way, what also needs to be understood—the EIP repository—how GitHub works is every time you create an issue or make a pull request, it counts up the number.

[2438.8s] So if we have ERC-7000, or there’s a number like 7000, it doesn’t mean there are actually 7000 standard proposals.
[2450.2s] People just took this issue number as a counter.
[2452.6s] And yeah, there are many issues—just discussions sometimes in the middle—and that counted up the number.

[2460.5s] So ERC-223 was the first one that kind of tried to solve this problem of notifying the other contract.
[2466.8s] That didn’t really get traction.
[2468.7s] Then Jordi Baylina had this idea of ERC-777—
[2473.7s] that was a bit later—to unify this as well.
[2477.2s] And basically the ERC-721 standard really took from this ERC-223 idea; kind of incorporated it.

[2486.3s] That’s why the NFT standard has a `safeTransferFrom` function—
[2492.8s] and that’s kind of the idea of notifying the other contract as well.

[2497.8s] So they kept both:
[2500.0s] the original transfer function, and the `safeTransferFrom` function, which in the end makes the whole standard even more quirky-looking and very inconsistent.

[2506.2s] And hence why this is all pretty much a hack—something that tries to be backwards compatible, but also tries to introduce new features. And then you have all these different function namings that are very confusing. Hence why we’re in the mess.

[2519.0s] And what you said initially about Ethereum being like a plane that is flying—and you’re trying to fix it as it flies—
[2527.2s] the thing is—the more it flies, the bigger it gets.
[2531.0s] And the more it grows, it becomes more like a ship, actually.
[2533.5s] The bigger the ship gets, the slower you can move it around, right?
[2537.7s] Like, a big ship needs a very wide turning radius.
[2539.5s] A small ship can turn tightly.

[2542.3s] Hence why any of these things—once there's a network effect, like ERC-20 or the token standards—it gets very difficult to
[2554.8s] make changes and convince people of novel ideas and introduce new standards.
[2562.3s] Hence why it took so long even for such a small addition—like an NFT versus a token, which is pretty much the same.

SPEAKER_01:
[2572.6s] No, yeah—I was actually looking into the ERC-223 recently, and it kind of made me think a bit about just the ERC-20—and if it was created in—
[2587.5s] you know—if it could have been—
[2591.4s] Really, my question for you is: looking back now at what you know today, is there anything that you would have added to the ERC-20 standard to make it better?
[2601.4s] Or do you think it was a good first iteration that’s really going to continue to thrive in the coming years?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2609.9s] I mean, we all know the quirkiness of ERC-20, you know, and this whole thing with approving
[2617.6s] contracts—that’s what led to so many losses, right?

[2622.1s] People go to a website, then the interface of MetaMask says, “Oh, this website tries to request access to your funds,” and it looks harmless. And then people click OK, and suddenly all their money’s gone.

[2634.7s] Because this `approve` process—as nice as it is—it’s hyper dangerous.
[2638.8s] You’re literally approving a third party to move your money.
[2642.5s] So it's almost the same as giving them the key to your car or to your house.

[2646.8s] So the thing is, what I did over the last few years is exactly what you just said—
[2655.6s] fixing all of these standards.
[2657.4s] That is what I’ve done with LUKSO.
[2662.1s] I mean, in the end—they were good first iterations, that’s for sure.
[2667.3s] And they were the first, you know, experiments. But they were by no means thought out.

[2672.3s] Neither did we have the knowledge or understanding—
[2679.9s] how the space works, how people build smart contracts, how they interact, what makes sense, what doesn’t.

[2682.3s] There was just no experience at the time.
[2688.8s] So it was the best there was at the time—but it is by no means the best we could do today.
[2694.7s] And I mean, that’s what I did in LUKSO. I literally standardized—
[2702.7s] I improved all these standards. Actually, we introduced a new ERC-20—that’s called LSP7 or LUKSO Standard Proposal number 7.
[2706.6s] And we introduced a new NFT—that’s called LSP8.
[2709.2s] And we introduced a smart contract account—
[2716.0s] that is a very multifunctional, super-generic smart account—
[2722.5s] that everybody would probably need right now, if they understood the tech.
[2724.3s] But yeah, exactly that.
[2727.2s] So I spent the last five years redoing this stuff because it just simply—it grew based on need, but it didn’t come out of sophisticated research.

SPEAKER_01:
[2739.0s] Yeah, for sure.
[2739.8s] I have plenty of questions about LUKSO, which—
[2743.8s] I want to finish up on so that we can get everybody nice and fresh about the LUKSO environment.

[2751.2s] One interesting question that I had—that’s been asked to me by a few people:
[2756.7s] What was the whole idea behind the whole Doge and ETH bridge? And why send 5% of MIST coin supply to the Doge-ETH bridge multisig?
[2768.2s] Like, I don’t know if you’re familiar with that?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[2770.9s] Yeah.
[2771.8s] Yeah.
[2772.9s] I mean, this was like something that Vitalik—
[2779.0s] I think there was this whole thing then.
[2782.5s] So basically, you know—the first copy of Bitcoin was Litecoin.
[2784.8s] And then at some point, somebody just misspelled the word “dog.” And then someone else thought it was super funny to create another
[2794.2s] clone of Bitcoin and call it Dogecoin—just for the lols, basically.
[2800.5s] And you know, that thing completely took off.
[2802.2s] It was literally the first meme coin.
[2804.2s] And because it took off so much, and at that time, it got quite some attention.

[2809.9s] And I’m not sure what the status of Ethereum was at the time—how big it was or how popular we were—
[2817.7s] but it was basically the idea to—I think the idea was to kind of
[2824.4s] marry, or kind of cross the bridge back again to the Ethereum–Bitcoin world.
[2835.6s] Because what happened is: when Ethereum came onto the scene, a lot of people were very hyped about it.

Alex Van De Sande:
[2843.1s] They thought like, this is the next big thing, you know? I mean, same as I—I came, obviously, we were all Bitcoiners, you know? Because that's what it was. You know, that was the biggest thing. We all,

[2852.0s] thought, okay, Bitcoin—maybe the big master chain—and all the others are super cool and interesting experiments.

[2859.3s] But we were all hyped about Ethereum as well.

[2861.8s] But there were some people who were not.

[2865.8s] They were like, feel very threatened, because they thought, okay, if now people go to Ethereum, then Bitcoin will lose in value.

[2872.4s] But we need to understand Bitcoin is the most decentralized and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[2876.7s] So yeah, this was the time when the Bitcoin maximalist was born.

[2880.8s] And

[2882.2s] Dogecoin—the Bitcoiners were kind of okay with Dogecoin because it used kind of the same protocol.

[2887.2s] And the idea of Dogecoin and befriending it in a way with Ethereum—and I think this was Alex, you know, tried, I guess—and this, it was really just more like an experiment. You know, an experiment of like, hey, can we build a bridge?

[2903.6s] And, you know, can we build a bridge between kind of Dogecoin and Ethereum, which is the same as building a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

[2910.7s] And he just found this with the MistCoin funny, I guess.

[2915.1s] I mean, this was something he did.

[2917.7s] I found it interesting, but I didn't care much, actually, at the time about it, really.

[2925.3s] It was just a play, I would say.

Interviewer:
[2928.5s] Yeah.
[2929.0s] Who sent the 50,000 Mist there?
[2931.9s] Do you know?

Alex Van De Sande:
[2932.4s] I think it was him.

[2935.0s] I mean, I'm not sure.
[2935.8s] I think it was him.
[2938.0s] It was definitely not me.

Interviewer:
[2940.8s] Yeah, it's something that we're very interested in over at the DAO—to hopefully maybe get some initiatives started with it.

[2946.8s] But there's a lot of famous people on that multisig there.

Alex Van De Sande:
[2951.2s] So I don't know, maybe you have to explain to me—it's still there?
[2956.2s] It still exists?

Interviewer:
[2958.0s] Yeah, I mean...
[2959.2s] All the Ethereum was taken out, obviously, because it was a bounty to get the bridge made. So all the Ethereum was taken out, but there still sits 5% of the Mist supply. It's just a funny, interesting little tidbit. But the signers on it are Alex,

[2986.9s] Vitalik... I don't know.
[2988.4s] Are you a signer on it?

Alex Van De Sande:
[2989.1s] No, I was not.
[2990.1s] I didn't really care about that bridge too much.

Interviewer:
[2992.9s] Yeah, so I think there's eight signers or six signers or something like that.

Alex Van De Sande:
[2997.7s] The question is, do they still have the keys?

Interviewer:
[2999.8s] Yeah, that's the question.
[3001.0s] But I mean, I'm sure Vitalik and all those people have a lot more going on at the moment.

[3006.7s] So maybe one day—maybe one day—there'll be a nice little gift to the DAO to get some initiatives going.

[3014.1s] But just something I was thinking about.
[3017.8s] So what was your initial...
[3019.8s] reaction when you discovered the recent MistCoin revival and what was taking place in the community and how it began to build around such an interesting piece of history?

Alex Van De Sande:
[3031.3s] I mean, there were people over the years who asked me if I could send them, so I sent them a bit here and there. But it was also not that easy to even interact with the contract because it was kind of like—you could do sending and stuff like this, but...

[3049.3s] You could import it into MetaMask, obviously, but you couldn't interact with more complex contracts because of that missing function, and everybody agreeing to this transferFrom stuff.

[3062.9s] Yeah, I mean, I just sent a few around just for fun.
[3065.1s] I honestly didn't think about it—I didn't—I mean, when I created it, I kind of thought, hmm, could this have value in the future?

[3072.9s] And then I thought shortly about it and thought, hmm, but for what would people use it? I don't know.

[3078.4s] So I don't think so.
[3080.4s] That was my thought back in the day.

[3082.9s] And then when people, you know, were interested, I thought, sure, cool—collect it.

[3088.9s] You know, I mean, there's a lot of people who collect all kinds of stuff.

[3091.2s] So I thought maybe this can become a collectible.

[3094.2s] And then when—I don't know—the MistCoin guy who made the MistCoin Twitter account came and...

[3104.1s] you know, said that he decorated this wrapper and now it can be used and traded, and they were all super hyped about it.

[3109.9s] And I thought, okay, that's interesting.
[3112.4s] That's very unexpected.

[3114.0s] But it kind of makes sense, you know, in the time where meme coins are the big deal, and collectibles and NFTs and everything is about that.

[3123.9s] And now also, it is a piece of history, right?

[3130.6s] It is literally the ultimate of piece of this token history because it is the first of its kind.

[3135.3s] And it has been really around for a long time.
[3139.6s] And even with the Dogecoin bridge, that's kind of funny.

[3146.9s] So yeah, it's totally part of the Ethereum evolution since pretty much the beginning.

[3151.8s] And now it's kind of been resurrected in some funny way.

Interviewer:
[3156.4s] Do you have any suggestions or any cool initiatives or ideas you would like to see for the further development of MistCoin?

[3166.5s] Or do you think it's just the historical value that it would carry on—to be a token that's at least collected and held in people's wallets?

Alex Van De Sande:
[3182.3s] I mean, in a way, you know, same with art—you know, why is art interesting?

[3187.0s] I mean, on one hand, it's about the idea, the concept—but it's also really often about the history.

[3191.7s] And, fun fact, you know, art—it becomes a lot more valuable when the artist dies. That doesn't mean I'm going to die, but...

Interviewer:
[3198.8s] Oh, yeah.
[3199.7s] Whoa.
[3199.9s] Relax, Fabi.

Alex Van De Sande:
[3201.3s] Yeah.
[3201.8s] No, I'm just saying that, you know, once time passes and once the history happens,

[3207.2s] that's when this stuff becomes super interesting suddenly.

[3211.4s] And suddenly it's like, you know, the thing that people talk about.

[3216.5s] And yeah, because it really enshrines this moment in time.

[3220.5s] So the collectible aspect is definitely there.

[3223.8s] And that's going to grow just because, you know, time passes more on and the Ethereum history and the token history—

[3231.0s] I mean, this space has grown to what it is because of the token standard.

[3235.2s] And because of everything that happened after. Literally, almost every business—you go to any blockchain conference—99% of those projects, they're about tokens or NFTs nowadays as well.

[3247.2s] And yeah, so this is basically a huge piece of history.

[3252.7s] But honestly, you know, the cool thing about tokens is

[3255.5s] that it is the same like with Dogecoin or whatever—

[3259.1s] I mean, things can be used for whatever people want to use it for.

[3263.1s] They could create a community around it that serves other purposes and functionalities than just a collection.

[3270.9s] And then you can wrap it and you can even issue NFTs out of this.

[3276.5s] Maybe we'll bridge over to Luxo at some point.

Interviewer:
[3281.6s] Is that in Fabian's plans?
[3284.5s] Is that in your plans?
[3285.4s] Is that potentially a secret alpha here?
[3288.6s] Like, what's going on?

Alex Van De Sande:
[3291.9s] I mean, we are working on a bridge together with Hashi.

[3296.3s] And that will be a generic bridge that could also potentially bridge things like MistCoin over.

[3302.2s] So yeah, I mean, once that bridge is working, you can pretty much—

[3307.0s] I mean, we have to see how the minting process works, but technically you could bridge almost everything.

[3313.6s] So, I mean, every token—let's call it like that, at least in the early form.

[3318.3s] I mean, we have to see. Probably in the beginning, we have to see if this is a manual thing, that there needs to be some whitelisted, or if it just works for everyone—we have to see.

[3327.7s] But technically, yeah.

Interviewer:
[3330.1s] I think we'd make the whitelist, Fabian.
[3332.4s] I think we would.
[3333.4s] But that's just...

Alex Van De Sande:
[3334.3s] I mean, I would definitely like to see it switching over to Luxo, that's for sure.

Interviewer:
[3339.0s] Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of questions about...
[3342.6s] Luxo as well.
[3344.2s] So yeah, let's head over to a few of those questions.
[3352.2s] Well, first, how has your experience with Ethereum and the ERC standard kind of influenced the development approach in what you're working on with Luxo—which we touched on a bit—but, I mean, if you would like to elaborate again.

Alex Van De Sande:
[3368.5s] Yeah, I mean, it all started out as the idea of, okay—how can we bring blockchain, you know, to ordinary users that are not so technical?

[3377.9s] How can we bring blockchain to the masses?

[3379.7s] And how can we bring it to the non-technical people of the world?

[3383.9s] I mean, the idea of a blockchain formed around lifestyle and culture was just a really good fit, because at the time it was all about money and DeFi.

[3397.7s] Sure, you could build the money Legos and extend this to eternity—but blockchain can do just so much more.

[3406.3s] Blockchain can be relevant for governance, voting, network states, social media. It can help with truth and journalism. It can help with funding across the globe.

[3419.9s] Community efforts of all kinds. It can help with memberships. It can help with pretty much anything where humans need to coordinate.

[3429.6s] Blockchain can be a key factor—and needs to be a key factor—of it.

[3433.8s] And that was just something that

[3439.2s] was not really on the forefront at the time, but it was really clear to me that—if we create such—
[3448.9s] I mean, this could be the perfect Trojan horse to bring decentralization into the masses.

[3454.8s] You know, if you do things that feel easy and fun—social and culture, you know, and lifestyle—then
[3464.9s] you get people who are usually not willing to invest their life savings into random coins interested, right?

[3466.3s] And that was the idea of Luxo, really.

[3468.3s] But I also realized that the most important piece here is

[3472.2s] the wallet and the account that you're using. That needs to be simple. That needs to be more than just a private key. That needs to be something that's actually functional.

(to be continued – next section continues beyond 3700s timestamps)

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[3724.7s] And that's a thought that you usually can't have in Ethereum, because you need to think first of how to make sure what I'm inventing here right now is still compatible with everything that's there, right?

[3736.8s] And then I can think, what can I add?

[3739.4s] But always keep in mind that it needs to be compatible.

[3742.1s] So when you go this route, then you're very limited in what you can do.

[3747.0s] Because you can only really just move the big ship so and so many degrees.

[3751.0s] But you can't make it a 30-degree turn.

[3753.3s] Otherwise, the ship wouldn't do it.

[3756.0s] The ship doesn't follow you.

[3757.4s] So we had this great opportunity to think it up from scratch.

[3761.5s] And we basically improved the token standards in the sense that, I mean, I first started out with making sure that the function names are all the same between tokens and NFTs, because it's pretty much 90% the same kind of thing, right?

[3777.6s] One, you transfer an amount.

[3779.0s] In the other, you transfer an ID.

[3781.3s] So why would the functions be all very different?

[3784.1s] So we can unify that.

[3786.5s] Then we introduced the ability that it notifies another smart contract, but instead of going with the idea of 223, which had like an onTokenReceive function, or 721 had this idea of like an onERC721Received function—

[3805.7s] Or even like 1820, which is the ERC-777 standard, which by the way, LSP7 is a 777-style standard, where there was a specific contract where you needed to read if that other contract can now receive it or not.

[3820.8s] You had this idea of like the registry thing.

[3823.6s] So basically, the problem with all of those is, if you want to have a generic smart contract account,

[3829.1s] and you now need to, for every protocol that comes up in the future, add a new function just so you're able to be notified by that, you know, whatever protocol somebody comes up with…

[3839.3s] Then the ship would never end.

[3840.7s] And you would end with hundreds of functions in your nice smart contract account, right?

[3846.6s] That's not a great idea.

[3848.6s] So the first thought then was, okay, we need a universal receiver.

[3852.5s] We need a universal function that any protocol can call, and it just calls it with a type ID and some data.

[3859.7s] And based on the type ID, then your profile could do certain things.

[3865.5s] And that became—fun fact—the first standard of LUKSO. It's called LSP1: the Universal Receiver.

[3872.3s] So I started out with that because the first thought was, okay, if I make a generic smart contract account, how can I make sure that tokens

[3879.2s] can generically inform these wallets—these smart contract accounts and wallets?

[3884.8s] So hence why Universal Receiver was the most important one.

[3889.4s] And all of this kind of thinking you can only do when you make things from scratch, in a clean way, with a clean slate, where you're not bound to backward compatibility on any of this stuff.

[3902.9s] So I think that also puts LUKSO in a very unique position because it's the first chain—

[3908.5s] or the first EVM chain definitely—where the foundational building blocks have been thought out from scratch, new, without considering being backward compatible to old stuff.

[3928.2s] Which makes it a lot nicer, a lot cleaner,

[3931.9s] and a lot more flexible in what it can do.

[3934.0s] And it works really holistically with a generic smart account system, which is what everybody wants to get to right now, right?

Unknown Speaker:
[3939.6s] Yeah.

[3940.6s] So I see LUKSO touts this innovative approach with Universal Profiles.

[3948.4s] How do you see Universal Profiles kind of changing Web3 and how it's approached by the masses?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[3956.3s] I mean, it's a smart contract account.

[3957.9s] It’s basically—I mean, it sounds maybe a bit bold—but it's in my opinion the most developed and most sophisticated smart contract account in existence right now.

[3968.0s] So if you have a smart contract account, you need a few properties.

[3973.4s] One thing you need is—

[3975.6s] You need to have the ability to obviously hold money or do anything on a blockchain.

[3980.9s] So you need to be able to generically execute, right?

[3983.1s] I mean, that's what Gnosis Safe has as well, right?

[3986.1s] That's kind of clear.

[3987.3s] But what else you need is this Universal Receiver.

[3992.8s] You need to be able for the smart contract to react to anything.

[3996.3s] And in Universal Profiles, it's done in such a way that you can even delegate

[4000.2s] this reaction—this notification reaction—onto an external contract you can change over time.

[4005.5s] So you can even change the way your profile reacts to incoming stuff.

[4010.2s] But most importantly, and funny enough, I haven't seen this anywhere in any of the current smart contract account ideas—
you need to be able to attach information.

[4022.0s] Because if you don't attach information, then you're missing the most key feature of an account, which is the stuff I can understand—stuff I can read.

[4030.4s] I mean, it's not only about a profile picture, right?

[4032.9s] That's the most obvious thing you can do.

[4036.3s] But if you want to have an on-chain account, you want to be able to attach information so that a protocol that interacts with your account can read certain things.

[4045.5s] You could, for example, attach KYC data.

[4048.1s] You could attach zero-knowledge proofs.

[4051.7s] You could attach, obviously, profile pictures.

[4055.2s] You could attach, you know, some kinds of lists—like follower lists or whatever else you need to be on the profile.

[4061.3s] So you could attach so many things.

[4065.1s] It just opens up the possibilities of protocols you can develop, because now the accounts that interact on-chain with your smart contract

[4074.9s] have information that's readable by that smart contract as well.

[4078.5s] And that just opens up the possibilities by 1000x.

Unknown Speaker:
[4082.9s] Yeah, this is actually very interesting, Fabian, because I’m actually building kind of like a SocialFi

[4088.7s] product at the moment.

[4089.9s] I mean, it's a bit off-topic and I'm just seeing how much this type of information and use cases could blend into what we're doing,

[4099.5s] when it comes to—specifically on the influencer side—and profiles for influencers, and kind of making these profiles like a reputation-based,

[4115.4s] like, you know, score almost—where you can actually kind of get an idea of the people that you're following, maybe what their trading history looks like—a lot of different things here that could overall make the space safer.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[4128.9s] Yeah.

[4129.5s] So, welcome to Universal Profiles.

[4130.9s] That’s exactly what it is.

Unknown Speaker:
[4132.6s] We need to have a talk then about this.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[4136.1s] So if you're building your system on Universal Profiles, you literally can probably save yourself a lot of time because 80% of it is already built out.

[4145.5s] I mean, you have the core account now that is generically manageable,

[4149.2s] and executable.

[4151.3s] Now all you need to worry about is building your dashboard that reads this information—and maybe some information that gets attached there.

[4159.5s] But you have now the account.

[4161.6s] We're the first ones who have merged the information of the account with the acting address.

[4168.9s] In every other system that has been there so far, it's always like—the wallet, and then there's maybe your ENS data.

[4176.6s] And your ENS holds the information—like your name and maybe some other information—and then the wallet is separate from that.

[4184.1s] The problem with that is, because it's not the same thing, your wallet can swap under the hood

[4189.5s] while the data stays at the same place.

[4192.1s] Or even if you look at Farcaster, there's your ID—you know, again the wallet can change.

[4197.8s] So whatever does something on-chain is never fully tied to that information.

[4202.9s] In Universal Profiles, it's the same address. It’s the same contract.

[4206.0s] Your contract has the generic key-value store

[4208.6s] that you can just call GetData—whatever key you want to read,

[4212.2s] and that's whatever data is stored under it.

[4215.1s] And that's the same address that's also doing the interaction with another smart contract.

[4219.6s] So your smart contract always knows about msg.sender, right?

[4222.8s] It knows who's calling it.

[4224.5s] It can always call back and check—instead of going to a third place and checking something in an ENS registry or something in this registry or that registry—it can just look literally at the place that called it, which is the profile.

[4237.7s] We're the first ones to merge this together—that the information space is the same as the execution space.

[4243.1s] Fun fact—that's the essence of Universal Profiles. It's ERC-725X and Y.

[4249.2s] In ERC-725, the standard is split in two.

[4252.2s] X is the execution, and Y

[4255.1s] is the data store.

[4256.6s] That's why "Y"—you know, it's funny—"why?" You can ask a question.

[4259.9s] And fun fact, that's also the human chromosomes—that I actually only figured out later by accident, that okay, actually yes, this is the human chromosomes.

[4269.3s] But it's basically your ERC-725 account—it’s between this information store and the general execution.

[4276.4s] Then it has a bunch of other features like the Universal Receiver.

[4279.6s] And there's a key manager in front, so you can properly manage that thing with multiple keys from different devices and permissions, and blah blah blah.

[4290.3s] It has a lot more features, but in its essence, it's just literally a smart account—like literally, that's what it is.

[4297.7s] It's an account that has a lot more information on it than just a dumb public key.

Unknown Speaker:
[4305.3s] So are those… are they soulbound, or can you move them around?

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[4310.2s] I don’t know how to answer this…

[4312.7s] I mean, to say it in a nice way—it’s not a token.

[4318.2s] It has nothing to do with the concept of an NFT or a token.

[4321.4s] It's an account.

[4322.8s] So it's soulbound because yes, it is the account itself.

[4325.7s] So the account is the wallet,

[4328.4s] and the wallet is the profile—and it's the same thing, at the same address. There is no differentiation.

[4334.2s] So it's not that you have a wallet and then… your wallet and your private key is irrelevant now, because that's not the one who is acting on-chain.

[4341.5s] What's acting on-chain is your smart contract account—which is also the one who holds information.

[4346.5s] Whoever signs the transaction to control that is irrelevant, because that's handled in the front—that's handled by the browser extension that we have

[4354.5s] that basically signs everything that goes through your Key Manager.

[4357.3s] The Key Manager checks that the stuff is allowed, and that your profile is allowed to—that this controller key can do something.

[4364.8s] Once he executes, he executes through your smart contract account.

[4368.7s] So the other contract that you're interacting with only reads msg.sender, which is your profile.

[4374.8s] So whatever happens before—even if you have 50 steps before it goes from offline to your profile—all the checks before

[4385.2s] are basically irrelevant, right?

[4389.0s] They're irrelevant, because it's not seen by the other smart contract.

[4393.0s] So it's soulbound because it's the same thing.

[4395.4s] There's no such thing as a wallet tied to whatever an NFT is.

[4401.0s] You only care about the Universal Profile address.

[4403.8s] You don't care who controls it,

[4405.8s] and you don't care how it's being controlled.

SPEAKER_00:
[4552.2s] We built even these profiles in such a way that you can deploy them cross-chain at the same address.
[4557.7s] That is only possible right now for the people who created the profile with us and still kept the original browser extension, because we stored that data that allows you to cross-chain deploy it to exactly the same address again on another chain.
[4573.4s] Technically, it can happen in multiple chains.
[4575.6s] But again, people need to keep in mind, this is multiple chains, multiple isolated environments, and it's multiple smart contracts.
[4581.9s] So obviously, even though it's the same address and maybe the same logic on both chains, it's two different smart contracts.
[4588.7s] So you can update the public picture on one, it wouldn't magically update on the other, obviously—because these things are not universally linked yet, without another protocol someone really needs to invent.
[4599.1s] But you can attach...
[4601.1s] So the thing is, you want to use—
[4603.1s] You ideally want to do most everything on LUKSO, because that's where your Universal Profile lives. That's where you get your reputation, that's where you have your interactions, that's where stuff is happening.
[4615.1s] So you want to do it on the chain where your Universal Profile lives.
[4618.2s] If you now have multiple Universal Profiles—even if they're the same address on multiple chains—
[4622.5s] it becomes a headache for users.
[4624.4s] And people make mistakes.
[4626.5s] They don't understand this whole multi-chain, cross-chain thing.
[4629.4s] And as much as DeFi wanted to simplify this by basically telling people, "Oh yeah, you can have this wallet everywhere..."
[4637.0s] It works for private keys, right?
[4639.1s] Because a private key can be signing on multiple chains.
[4643.8s] But it doesn't work for a smart contract account—
[4646.1s] so easily.
[4647.5s] And with private keys, you know, you have all the troubles that you have with private keys, right?
[4652.3s] So you can't really have information attached to it. You can't manage it properly long term. It's not something you want to build a reputation on, because you could lose it at any point—there’s no recovery ability, no social recovery, nothing you can add to it.
[4669.1s] So it's just a private key, in the end.
[4672.1s] So if you want to build anything socially, you want to pick a chain—like picking a country.
[4676.5s] And then, with LUKSO, it's basically pretty straightforward to build anything.
[4682.6s] So right now, there's only a browser extension.
[4685.4s] There's a mobile app that's in the works, but we're also looking into ways to bring the browser extension to mobile.
[4692.2s] But yeah, if you build a dapp and you want to run it on LUKSO—
[4696.9s] It works out of the box. Pretty much, if you want to, you connect the Universal Profile.
Nothing changes. You just use it the same way you use it with MetaMask. Nothing changes for you as a dapp developer.

SPEAKER_01:
[4708.0s] It's the exact same thing—except that you now have the possibility to add information and read a profile picture and do a lot more things. I mean, honestly, with the social-Fi environment and how hot of a topic that is, I think it would be—
[4727.0s] There would be great synergy there, to not only help LUKSO—or help us—but help LUKSO as well.
[4734.7s] A Soulcify product is literally geared specifically for this.
[4740.3s] I think you have a great opportunity there when it comes to Soulcify products.
[4745.1s] Now somebody just needs to take the leap and build it out there.

SPEAKER_00:
[4751.2s] Yeah.
[4752.0s] I mean, it's—yeah, many, many things can now be built.
[4755.5s] Like you said, it's the account abstraction chain.
[4759.1s] I think that's a bit too cheesy.

SPEAKER_01:
[4761.1s] Once that narrative takes off and people start to talk about account abstraction—you don’t necessarily have to call it that—but really that's what it essentially is. You know, the fundamentals of it are there to make sure that—or allow people to use blockchain without really—
[4781.2s] knowing that they're using blockchain. And we know that's going to onboard the normal people to use it, because they all think blockchain is hard to use and confusing, when it's really not.
[4793.7s] But, um, it is—for the reason.

SPEAKER_00:
[4797.4s] I mean, the thing is, the foundation is now there.
[4800.2s] We developed it.
[4801.1s] It took five years to get there.
[4803.3s] So it was a long journey to get this right.
[4806.4s] So building the foundation, the smart contract standard—and getting it right—that's the hardest task.
[4812.0s] Because that stuff, you don’t want to change, right?
[4814.3s] Once there's adoption around a certain thing, it needs to be built on the right thing.
[4818.0s] Otherwise, you have the same problem Ethereum has now with ERC-20, where something that—
[4823.0s] was not perfect—became the number one.
[4825.2s] So now everybody's stuck with that.
[4827.5s] So you want to get it right—especially for an account.
[4831.0s] Imagine you have an account that is very limited in what it can do.
[4834.4s] And then five years down the road, you realize, fuck—we can't go back.
[4837.1s] You can't change it.
[4838.1s] And everybody went this way.
[4839.7s] And now we're all stuck in this system that is limited.
[4844.5s] So you need to get it right.
[4845.9s] Hence why it took so long to get it right.
[4847.8s] So from now on, it's only about building the interfaces for it.
[4851.1s] It's only about building the tools to use it.
[4854.0s] It's only the websites to show it and to integrate it.
[4857.0s] And you can now build everything on top of this.
[4859.0s] You can add social recovery.
[4861.0s] You can even add Passkey.
[4864.2s] So you could even control your profile through a Passkey from multiple devices—except that right now, Passkey costs 200,000 gas to verify on-chain. But maybe in the future, there can be a precompile in Ethereum—and then also in LUKSO—that allows you to have your Passkey keys to control your profile.
[4881.4s] So you can build anything you can think of on top of Universal Profiles—anything.

SPEAKER_01:
[4887.6s] Yeah, no—this is amazing.
[4889.3s] Um, okay—
[4890.4s] My final question is, given your involvement in the creation of the ERC-725 and, you know, the beginning days of Ethereum—
[4912.6s] could you maybe elaborate on how the ERC-725 standard benefits both LUKSO and Ethereum ecosystems, especially in terms of identity management and on-chain interaction? And how do you see there could be synergy there, so that both chains can grow and get better—and the space, in general, can get better?

SPEAKER_00:
[4923.4s] So Universal Profiles is a generic smart contract standard.
[4927.9s] That means it out of the box works on every EVM chain.
[4931.5s] Except, if you want to have all the user experience and the bells and whistles, you need a few more things.
[4936.6s] You need, obviously, a browser extension—we built that. And you need—
[4939.7s] a transaction relay service, if you want to have gasless experiences or very smooth onboarding.
[4945.7s] And you need a few other things.
[4948.0s] But apart from that, the standard itself works.
[4951.0s] We are currently working on making Universal Profiles work also on Ethereum.
[4956.1s] So that means we open our browser extension for Ethereum and potentially other chains as well.
[4960.5s] And we're basically allowing your profile that you already have in LUKSO—that you can cross-chain deploy it to any of the other networks as well.
[4970.2s] In the end, ultimately, every chain will benefit from Universal Profiles or ERC-725 accounts, obviously—because they're a generic smart contract account, right?
[4979.9s] That is just useful to have anywhere.
[4983.5s] I personally—maybe the benefit you get by being on LUKSO is—LUKSO has not only invented this smart contract account, but we've also made all the other standards work very smoothly and nicely together.
[4997.1s] They're better to work with.
[4999.2s] They're more flexible in what they can do, and they are very harmoniously working with Universal Profiles. That creates a more decentralized on-chain experience.
[5009.7s] That's why LUKSO is the better place to build it.
[5013.2s] It can be used on any other chain as well, but because you have the network effect on those chains—and because they're using ERC-20 and all the other stuff—it doesn't flourish as much, let’s say, as it does on LUKSO.
[5028.4s] It's like, if you have a modern car and you go on a shitty road—then it doesn't drive so well.
[5034.4s] So you want to be on a great road too.
[5037.3s] So you want to have the whole package—not the half package.
[5041.8s] But the smart contract account will totally benefit—
[5045.7s] any—
[5060.9s] It's not a smart contract account in that sense.
[5063.9s] It's a multi-sig, right?
[5065.5s] You don't have a permission system on this.
[5067.3s] You cannot attach information to a Gnosis Safe.
[5070.1s] It's a multi-sig, right?
[5071.9s] And you can actually put a multi-sig—you could put a Gnosis Safe—in front of a Universal Profile. And now you can even use it as a company account or a company profile.
[5082.8s] Or you can put a voting contract in front of a Universal Profile and you have a DAO.
[5087.0s] And now you have the benefit of not only having a DAO where you can vote, but you have a DAO that has a profile picture, a website that can be community-governed, and information that's attached to this DAO profile.
[5097.6s] And you can literally manage that whole profile, as a community, in a decentralized fashion—with even subgroups having separate permissions where they could steer a portion of the money separately from what the people are voting on.
[5110.9s] It’s not all possible because of the standard that is out now, but—yeah—it needs some interest, understanding, and learning a little bit if you really want to do very sophisticated things. But if you just want to use it as a wallet—
[5124.9s] It needs no learning at all.
[5126.8s] It just works out of the box like any EOA.

SPEAKER_01:
[5130.6s] Yeah, no—this is honestly amazing.
[5134.2s] I think I'm a LUKSO maxi now.
[5136.3s] Um, it's really—obviously for the more public side of things—there's always going to be, you know, the use cases for privacy and whatnot.
[5147.8s] And that's fine.
[5149.6s] But, you know, in this space with so many bad actors, I feel like these Universal Profiles are actually very important.
[5160.2s] It's just going to keep getting worse and worse unless there's something put in place to mitigate these bad actors.
[5167.3s] And I think that starts with something like Universal Profiles, where there's actually some data to go off of inside of these profiles.
[5178.0s] And that's honestly what I'm building and what I'm seeing.
[5181.3s] You know, the synergy here—and potentially me and your team could jump on a call or something and figure out how we could get this over to LUKSO.
[5190.4s] But I'm super excited about it and going to dive a bit more into the tech with my developers.
[5197.4s] But yeah, I truly appreciate you jumping on the call and telling us about the past, what you're working on now.
[5205.0s] And I really appreciate it.
[5207.5s] I mean, if you want to take a couple more questions from anybody that wants to come up, I will—if you want to.
[5214.3s] Just going to warn everybody that we want to be respectful here as well.
[5218.9s] But if you're all set, I'm good.
[5222.0s] I really appreciate everything—the knowledge that you've bestowed upon us here.
[5229.1s] I appreciate it.

SPEAKER_00:
[5232.2s] Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to talk about a bit of the history.
[5235.7s] I mean, obviously, the situation that we are facing right now at LUKSO is—every time we talk to people and every time we explain it, everybody realizes, "Oh my God, this is the big shit."
[5247.3s] What we have right now, the biggest problem, is that we're not getting enough attention.
[5252.2s] And not enough attention on what it really is.
[5255.0s] People who have heard about LUKSO in the past kind of put it into a box—like some fashion chain not relevant to them.
[5262.5s] We have literally built the most important foundation for blockchain going forward, probably.
[5268.7s] I mean, there's nothing comparable existing. And now it needs—
[5272.5s] To spread. The knowledge and the idea need to spread.
[5275.6s] That's the most important aspect that needs to happen.

SPEAKER_01:
[5278.1s] I mean, honestly, that's where I see a social-Fi product coming in—to onboard users.
[5285.7s] I mean, you could see what happened with Base last year where—
[5290.7s] First off, Base is Coinbase, so it's going to attract users, period.
[5296.1s] But everybody saw the huge uptick in Base once Friend.tech was added to it.
[5302.8s] And from my understanding of the technology and everything that we talked about here—
[5307.9s] your chain is literally geared perfectly for a social-Fi product. If you could get a social-Fi product on LUKSO that—
[5323.5s] brother, you'll see the people flock over there easily. Because, first off, everybody loves free money—
[5332.9s] free money, which is good and stuff.
[5339.5s] But if you build a good product, they come for the free money, but then they stay because the product's good.
[5346.5s] There's a lot of opportunities people are seeing from LUKSO that you're—"Oh look at these Universal Profiles."
[5349.5s] "I could actually follow them."
[5349.3s] "I could see what this guy is doing."
[5349.5s] "Oh,
[5349.5s] he's a good actor, he's a bad actor—oh, he just shilled this but then dumped it 15 minutes later."
[5356.1s] These are problems in the space that specifically LUKSO can help mitigate.

SPEAKER_00:
[5362.3s] I love it.
[5363.9s] I mean, there's maybe one thing I want to add to this is that—it is a bit more.
[5366.0s] So we didn't just want to create one kind of app, like a Farcaster or a Friend.tech or whatever, where it just does one thing and it does this, and then they need to add a few more features here and there.
[5380.5s] We created the foundation for any of those things.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[5383.4s] Any of those things—Forecaster, Friend.tech, anything—if they would switch to Universal Profiles, they could throw away 30% of their app systems and make it a lot easier for themselves and for everyone else, because that stuff plugs perfectly into a profile.
[5397.9s] You don't even need—like, everybody reinvented the account because they didn't have an account, right?
[5401.6s] And then they tried to figure out how to connect the wallet of a user to it.
[5404.9s] We have that built, that you can now literally have out of the box, and you can just plug in and care about what you actually want to build, which is your app, right?
[5411.9s] And not the account system.
[5413.3s] So the account system is not there—
[5416.2s] But it is built so much more on a ground level—hence why it allows everything—that now anybody can come and build the follower system or whatever else on top of this.

[5426.4s] And then, yes, it becomes not only one new app—it becomes basically a foundation for a decentralized social.
[5434.5s] Decentralized social means that anybody can come and help build the pieces of the social network.
[5440.0s] It's not one social network.
[5441.6s] The network is the social network itself, and everybody can build an aspect of it. And there can be many windows into the same social network, and then you get all of what you said—the transparency and all of the stuff.
[5453.1s] And yeah, that’s only possible because the accounting is—
[5458.0s] That’s solved, and that was the most important thing to solve.
[5461.9s] But when it comes to questions, I’m happy to take a question.

[5465.6s] By the way, one thing also—Skima, who is here as a listener in there—
[5471.0s] He can happily help.
[5473.2s] He’s one of our smart contract devs.
[5474.5s] He can happily help with explaining to your team how stuff works, if you have a question.

[5479.0s] But really important: go to docs.lukso.tech.
[5483.1s] They have pretty much all the knowledge there.
[5486.1s] We are constantly working on improving them to make them even more digestible, even more readable, and simpler. Because obviously it's a lot to take in if you want to try everything.
[5495.3s] But most people don’t even need to understand—
[5500.4s] 90% of it, you know, what's in there. Because your apps just work out of the box, and you can go feature by feature. Whatever you need, you can go figure out, "How would I do this in Universal Profiles?"—and you will find a way.
[5511.4s] So you don’t need to learn all the standards and then go build.
[5514.3s] You can literally go step by step, and you’d literally need to know nothing to just get started.
[5519.0s] Connecting your profile is the same as connecting a wallet.
[5523.0s] And you can grow from there—and it’s fairly simple.

Host:
[5528.7s] Amazing, man.
[5529.5s] I really—
[5530.5s] I really learned a lot.
[5531.6s] I appreciate it.
[5532.7s] I will be in contact, if that’s okay with you, just to maybe bounce some ideas around.
[5538.6s] But yeah, I really appreciate this.
[5541.3s] I would love to do another Spaces where it’s you and potentially Alexander Afsa, if you would be willing to do that—maybe in a couple of weeks, a month or so, give a little break here.
[5553.5s] But yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[5556.5s] I don’t see any hands up if anybody wanted to ask a question.
[5560.4s] But yeah, thank you very much.
[5562.7s] I had a great time talking to you.
[5564.9s] And we’ll be in touch, man.
[5566.9s] I appreciate what you’re doing for the space and what you’ve done for the space.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[5571.0s] Yeah, thank you so much as well.
[5572.4s] I mean, happy to join in a call with Alexander Afsa.
[5577.6s] I haven’t been in a public Twitter Space—I guess ever.
[5582.2s] So it will definitely be fun.
[5584.9s] If anybody has a question, then feel free.
[5587.6s] By the way, maybe one other thing—
[5588.8s] You talked about airdrops and stuff.
[5590.8s] We’re working on an Airdropper—so basically, a tool that anybody can just use to scan all the newest profiles out there, give it certain metrics like: “Has it interacted with this token?” or “Has it interacted with this protocol?” or “Was it created from then to then?” or “Has so and so many transactions or gas used,” and then basically get the list of the profiles out and drop them whatever you like.
[5616.9s] Basically, it’s a generic tool for anybody to create—
[5619.7s] you know, to airdrop stuff.

[5621.3s] Which—welcome to the world of spamming, I guess.

Host:
[5627.5s] I mean, it’s an attention economy, like you’re saying.
[5633.6s] And you gotta grab people’s attention.
[5636.1s] And unfortunately—not unfortunately, but—

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[5636.1s] Less, a little unfortunately—that money is—you know, money speaks all.
[5641.2s] So yeah.
[5642.6s] I mean, this is definitely—
[5644.0s] I mean, the airdrop tool would be fun.
[5646.1s] We also will probably use it ourselves.
[5648.2s] I mean, this is really—we build it for ourselves, but it’s very generically usable for other people.
[5653.8s] And we have already a lot of NFT projects on Lukso.
[5656.4s] We have a lot of meme coins on Lukso.
[5658.6s] There's already quite a social community.

[5660.1s] And the cool thing is: if you go to universalprofile.cloud—
[5664.9s] You can see the profiles.
[5666.7s] You can see the activity.
[5667.9s] You can see what's happening on-chain.
[5669.5s] You can see what people collect.

[5671.0s] It’s already a social space and a social chain—by default—because everybody is a profile.
[5675.6s] Hence why it’s the Account Abstraction chain, right?

Host:
[5681.5s] And you know—hey, you could take that.
[5683.6s] I’m not trademarking none.
[5689.6s] Yeah, this was great.
[5691.3s] I appreciate you.
[5692.7s] And we’ll be in touch.
[5694.4s] I got some ideas for Lukso.
[5696.4s] We’ll bounce them back off each other.
[5698.8s] So, if nobody has any questions—which it doesn’t look like it—I’m going to close it up.
[5703.2s] Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[5704.5s] Thanks, Fabian.
[5706.8s] Have a good day, guys.

Fabian Vogelsteller:
[5708.5s] Thank you, guys.
[5709.1s] Thanks, everybody.
