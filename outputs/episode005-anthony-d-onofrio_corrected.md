SPEAKER_03:**
[79.0s] Can you hear me?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[86.9s] Can you hear me?
[88.3s] Yes, I can.
[90.1s] Excellent.
[92.4s] Happy Stratospaces.
[110.1s] GM.
[118.4s] What's up guys?
[123.1s] How are you?
[125.8s] I'm good.
[126.3s] First week of September.
[130.0s] I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall, but nevertheless,
[138.3s] super excited for a new month.
[140.4s] I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[144.6s] I think technically fall starts on either the 21st or 22nd, but spiritually it starts after Labor Day, of course.
[162.3s] I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but I actually sort of have a white suit.
[170.1s] And you can no longer wear those already.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[175.6s] Might have to see that.
[179.0s] White suit's pretty nice.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[181.8s] I may have a photo, I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been.
[192.4s] But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[196.3s] Yeah.
[199.1s] Texts, you're welcome.
[203.5s] We had them, we lost them.
[211.5s] Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in.
[219.4s] Spiritually, fall is here, along with football, to the behest of our European counterparts.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[234.8s] By the way, for Spaces resiliency, ChatGPT is recommending two co-hosts up front.
[242.1s] Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[246.1s] Yeah, you and Bob are co-hosts.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[250.0s] Okay, it just appears as speaker to me.
[251.5s] Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side.
[254.8s] Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[258.2s] It appears so.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[260.1s] I see it now.
[261.0s] Okay, fantastic.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[272.9s] Can you hear me?
[273.5s] All right, cool.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[275.2s] Oh, wait.
[276.0s] Very, very kind of cool August.
[279.6s] For those of us who've spent some of it in New York, like August is supposed to be hot and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year.
[293.4s] I don't know what's going on.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[297.1s] Yeah, completely agree.
[298.3s] A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night.
[305.0s] Cooler.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[309.4s] You guys are old.
[312.4s] Been around talking about the weather.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[314.6s] We're waiting for you.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[316.1s] Well, I'm here.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[318.6s] Even better.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[319.8s] Welcome.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[321.4s] What's up?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[323.6s] GM.
[324.1s] Yeah, great.
[324.8s] Great to kick this off.
[329.5s] I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFT, Texture.
[334.5s] It's quite a good one.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[336.5s] Thanks, man.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[337.4s] Do you own a Texture punk?

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[340.4s] I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might have to get one.

[350.8s] It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly.
[353.0s] So I made myself a better one.
[354.4s] And then a friend asked me to make her one, and then somebody else asked me to make one.
[358.9s] And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own.
[364.6s] And then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, look—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[374.5s] That's some good lore.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[375.6s] That's some great lore right there.
[380.5s] I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[385.8s] Accidental success.
[387.1s] Fantastic.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[392.1s] Great.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[392.4s] All right.
[392.8s] Well, let’s get going.
[395.1s] So, hi Texture.
[398.2s] How are you?

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[399.3s] It's been a while.
[400.7s] It's been a long time.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[403.6s] When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love.
[409.5s] And something I spotted going through making my notes is your Medium is called Peace Love Revolution.
[421.7s] So what’s the story there?

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[425.0s] So, you know, I was kind of—I wouldn’t say a hippie.
[430.4s] I didn’t dress like a hippie.
[431.4s] I didn’t really hang out with hippies, but I took some psychedelics when I was a kid and I had some experiences, and, you know, it kind of drove my passion for
[441.6s] doing good things and spreading love in the world.
[445.5s] I know people who probably follow me are like, “What? He just calls people retards all day.”
[450.2s] Yeah, but I mean, I’m on Twitter.
[451.6s] I don’t know.
[452.2s] It’s full of retards.

[455.1s] So I started this group called Peace Love Human because I was sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco, and I was watching the news and
[467.3s] seeing how religions got all fucked up.
[469.1s] And I was like, what if there was like a religion that didn’t have any beliefs?
[471.9s] And we just went out and did nice shit.
[475.0s] So for like three years of my life, I was just homeless and had no job and was into setting up like Free Hug events and other stuff just to make people smile.

[485.9s] Because making people feel loved or making people happy was not a quantifiable metric, but making people smile—
[492.8s] so that was what I did
[495.9s] for my early 20s.
[499.8s] So that’s what I was doing: the community building.
[502.9s] I accidentally started a cult.
[504.8s] And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

UNKNOWN:**
[509.9s] Okay.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[511.0s] But it helped me.
[511.8s] You know, it was my first foray into cult building, which obviously—

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[516.0s] Right.
[516.8s] Very useful.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[517.8s] I took into my role in Ethereum, and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[522.8s] I seem to remember at some point you told me that you’ve probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[529.7s] A thousand in a day—probably a hundred thousand or more.
[539.9s] It was nice.
[541.0s] It was good.
[542.8s] I could waste this entire thing telling that story.
[548.0s] That’s probably not what people want to hear.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[552.1s] I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that score.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[558.2s] Yeah, that’s—so DDP, Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed in my apartment in Brooklyn.
[566.9s] And we had this three-story loft in a warehouse and we’d let people come crash, and he came through, and that’s how I met him.
[575.1s] And I’ve done three or four of them.
[577.6s] I was—I was—
[581.4s] what is it—
[582.1s] it’s Tom.
[583.2s] I was Tom.
[584.2s] So Tom is like a rotating—
[586.1s] I was Tom one time.
[587.7s] So that was fun.
[588.4s] I had to shave my beard.
[589.7s] I had a mustache.
[590.5s] I looked funny.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[595.3s] I’ll drop some links on Twitter for that, for anyone who hasn’t seen Decentralized Dance Party, or you can go and have a Google on your own.
[603.9s] It’s quite exceptional.

**SPEAKER_02 (Texture):**
[607.2s] It’s funny.
[608.0s] I had no—
[610.7s] I didn’t really understand the decentralized thing at that point.
[613.4s] I was not really involved.
[614.4s] So he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me.

**SPEAKER_00 (Bob):**
[619.6s] For sure.
[620.8s] So yeah, that’s Gary Lachance, who was a fellow Vancouverite with me.
[626.6s] He was, funnily enough, in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver Decentral—
[635.9s] the whole Decentral Toronto, Vancouver thing.
[639.9s] Gary was in that photo for the first one.
[643.3s] Maybe well-known as well now for DogeClarin.
[646.8s] So there is the Doge-wrapped McLaren, which travels around many conferences where they can get financial support for that.
[662.0s] Yeah, Gary’s a great guy.

[1078.2s] You did that one?

Aaron Wright:**
[1080.2s] Yeah.
[1083.4s] Again, the timing, I don't know, but obviously by that time we had been doing it for a minute.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1090.7s] Yeah.
[1091.7s] I mean, the funny thing was looking at that, that’s before there was any code — any public code at least. There wasn’t even any Python code from Vitalik published at that point.
[1102.9s] Gavin and Jeff were weeks away still.

Aaron Wright:**
[1105.4s] Yeah.
[1105.5s] And Jeff — Jeff, to my understanding, just read the white paper and started coding it up on his own and said, “Hey, I’ve got this Go implementation.”

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1114.4s] Yeah, pretty much.
[1115.7s] And same for Gav.
[1118.3s] They were both at the very tail end of December — basically like a Christmas project kind of deal for them, for the pair of them.

Aaron Wright:**
[1125.3s] Yeah, no, it was great. You know, and I’ve been a developer my whole life since I was a kid.
[1131.3s] And since I’d quit coding, I wasn’t really sure where I fit in, you know? But I was really happy when all these other people got in.
[1138.4s] I guess maybe if I’d have dropped some code and gotten a lot more ETH, that would have been cool, but whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1148.4s] So I mean, to you at that point, what was Ethereum?
[1155.3s] What was this vision and what were you thinking that that could unfold to be?
[1162.6s] What was the kernel of that?

Aaron Wright:**
[1167.5s] Yeah, so I mean, it's so hard to remember those days.
[1172.6s] There’s so much on top of it now.
[1174.2s] I remember the general vibe was just...
[1179.0s] A technology that would allow people to coordinate, to encode value — I mean, you know, just at all dimensions.
[1184.2s] Things that haven’t even come to fruition yet, things that people aren’t even thinking about because...

[1194.0s] So much of it has gone to scale. Just like fundraising — fundraising locally, like just coordinating anything.
[1202.2s] I mean, it was just the whole world, like just imagining every single system being replaced by this decentralized coordination structure that gives some 11-year-old kid in
[1219.7s] Bangalore the ability to create the next, you know, technical development.
[1224.5s] And I think that kind of platform is just something that seemed really empowering.
[1233.4s] So, you know, a lot of idealism. You know, obviously real life as it’s played out is a lot messier and a lot different from how we imagined it.
[1243.9s] But a lot of idealistic things — a lot of, like, very much...
[1250.4s] Just really: coordination.
[1253.2s] And that’s a really shitty description of the vision that I had, because it was so deep and so multidimensional.
[1260.4s] But yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1261.8s] “Social operating system” is something I’ve seen you say on a few occasions.

Aaron Wright:**
[1266.3s] Yeah, I mean — yeah. Just there are so many dimensions to it, but yeah. I mean, a social operating system for allowing people to encode their values — or encode... yeah, literally their values. Anything with value. Creating incentive structures, contracts that are enforced at the exact level that they were designed to.
[1294.3s] Which — none of that sounds really technical and sexy, but to me it was really about the impact.
[1300.9s] What happens when you empower people to be able to create value in their local communities or encode value in ways they haven't been able to?
[1310.5s] What happens when...
[1312.3s] You know, the equity in your company can be easily traded — you know, just all these things.
[1320.6s] Just — what happens when you can do that to houses and local businesses and local communities?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1328.9s] Yeah, I mean, I think in my own sort of thinking in those early days, it was an awful lot about empowerment and about, you know, giving people the ability to control their own destiny, right?

[1340.3s] Yeah.
[1341.6s] And something I repeatedly thought was like — if you think about the... what’s it called?
[1350.8s] The pyramid of needs?
[1352.1s] What's it called?
[1352.8s] I forget the... Maslow.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1354.4s] The hierarchy.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1355.3s] Yeah, Maslow’s, right.
[1356.5s] Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
[1358.5s] You know, I remember a number of times saying, it’s frankly obscene given all the resources that we have in the world and how— you know, how much more there is than in previous years.
[1374.1s] It’s obscene that people should be worried about housing or education or healthcare or — you know, just these basic things, right?
[1383.8s] And how wonderful would it be if you could, like, yank up...
[1388.0s] that base layer a little bit so that people are not living in this fearful place of powerlessness, but instead can be not worrying about that shit, and not having to make these compromised bad decisions and everything. But just — if you could do what you love, what a world that would be.

Aaron Wright:**
[1413.5s] Yeah, and I'm a lot less idealistic about it now after...
[1418.7s] the last decade, for a lot of reasons.
[1421.4s] But, you know, the marshmallow test is real. And you can create really good technologies and really good user experiences, and as many guardrails as you can for people.
[1433.1s] But at the end of the day, there’s motherfuckers that are going to eat the marshmallow before they even hear the rules — you know? And then they’ll do it again and again.
[1439.5s] So, I think there’s a lot of... It’s not that I think the problems are unsolvable, but they’re — you know, the idea that...
[1448.5s] it’s something from above being imposed down.

[1455.0s] You know, despite the fact that the system seems to be that way, I think a lot of it is just the level of complexity of modern life relative to the average intelligence...
[1468.0s] it's just — it's a wide gap. And there's a lot of — I mean, I could talk about that for fucking 10 hours too, so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1477.3s] Yeah.
[1478.0s] Well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of — almost like — allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization, or hierarchy, or structure.
[1493.1s] You know, just like this total flip to the opposite side, right?
[1496.4s] Everything’s got to be flat and open, and — you know — everyone involved with everything. Which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything.
[1507.4s] Yeah, it’s just nutty.

[1512.9s] But then I realized, it’s like hierarchy isn’t the problem.
[1518.1s] Being trapped in a hierarchy where it’s to your detriment and you can’t get out is the problem.
[1524.0s] Yeah.

Aaron Wright:**
[1525.4s] Yeah.
[1525.8s] And a lot of — I think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people, you know...
[1531.6s] Smart people aren't really — they don't really understand not-smart people.
[1536.9s] And so what happens is we are born into a world where these pre-existing hierarchies exist and they've — to some degree or another — kind of persisted through generation after generation.
[1551.6s] And then we come in and we’re like, “Why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy?
[1554.1s] I’m smart.
[1555.1s] We’re all too smart for this.”
[1556.3s] And then they try to like...

[1558.0s] You know, they try to create new systems assuming that everyone is approximately like them.
[1562.0s] And then — you know, I’ve been through so many. Because again, coming through the hippie shit, I was in the Bay Area for a long time.
[1568.8s] You see so many people think they’re the first person to ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better.
[1574.5s] And at the end of the day, man — that’s fine if you want to talk all the fucking time and argue and get nothing done.
[1581.7s] But at the end of the day, a hierarchy is an information structure.
[1586.0s] And it’s also an accountability structure.
[1588.6s] And so as long as there’s accountability at the top, and as long as the information is flowing correctly, and as long as the outputs are optimal to some degree — then it’s the best you’re going to get.
[1600.7s] And it doesn’t mean we can’t continually improve.
[1603.9s] Obviously life gets better.
[1605.7s] And we have an obligation.
[1607.2s] I think...

[1609.2s] When you’re creating things, it’s not just the creating things.
[1612.5s] And I think this is a big problem that still exists in crypto.
[1616.7s] People think “if you build it, they will come.”
[1619.4s] You can’t just build it.
[1620.5s] You have to build it, and then you have to make it a button — a single button.
[1624.0s] It has to be so simple your grandma can do it — and not destroy her life.
[1628.8s] And so it is this kind of perpetual attempt to take these complex structures, simplify them so that everyone has access to them — but through that simplification not create these kinds of hells that no one can get out of.
[1646.6s] And I think...

[1647.9s] You know, just because of the rate of technological development and the nature of economic progress, our opportunity as people trapped in those systems is to build new systems.
[1661.7s] But ultimately we're going to come face to face with the reality of why those systems were set up the way they were — and understand that...
[1668.7s] The best we can really hope for in most instances is an optimization of that.
[1673.3s] We can try to make it simpler, more efficient, better, and more adaptable.
[1679.1s] But those are a lot of dimensions. And any one of them out of sync is going to create either more problems — or the system itself will collapse.
[1692.3s] And if the system doesn’t exist, then nobody gets anything.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1698.9s] Yeah.
[1699.4s] I mean, I guess it’s a little bit analogous to technical debt and things in code.
[1704.7s] Yep.
[1705.5s] If you’ve got code and you’re like, “Jesus, look at this.”
[1708.6s] It’s so much complexity, and these conditions...
[1711.7s] “I don’t think we need any of that.”
[1713.4s] Let’s just take all that out.
[1716.4s] But — you know — someone did that for a reason.
[1719.2s] You may not know the reason, but it was done for a reason.
[1722.8s] And — you’re going to have some consequence if you do that, right?
[1728.5s] You can only be so simple without being too simplistic — and then you miss out on that detail.
[1739.2s] I mean, I guess it’s like, you know, with US legal stuff — “This hot liquid might burn you” or whatever.
[1747.5s] You just know that some shit’s happened in the past, right?
[1750.0s] The reason that all of these things have happened is someone’s done something really fucking stupid.

Aaron Wright:**
[1755.0s] Yeah. And I — you know, after I became a father, I became really a huge proponent of the idea that if you think a stupid rule exists because the person who made it is stupid...
[1768.0s] you haven’t thought through the problem.
[1769.7s] It isn’t a bunch of people — I’m not saying this never existed — but it’s not like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to just ruin your life.
[1779.8s] It’s some fucking idiot who did some idiot shit.
[1783.2s] And then now you gotta make a stupid rule.
[1785.0s] You know what I mean?
[1785.7s] And you gotta enforce it with fire.
[1787.4s] Otherwise, you know, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet and you find it six months later.
[1794.0s] And so — you know — it's just that at scale.

[1798.9s] But you’re going to have to keep me on topic as much as you want to, because I am a meanderer.

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2125.6s] And I guess.

[2126.5s] I guess this is the reason why things like the ETFs are so appealing, right?

[2131.5s] It's just... Yeah.

[2133.4s] Can I just not deal with any of this shit at all?

[2136.4s] But I can just like use my brokerage account I've already got and it's just a thing that I buy or sell, right?

[2142.0s] And just, you know, it's a proxy for it, but most people don't care.

Texture:**
[2147.4s] Yeah, but that reduces it to an investment vehicle, right?

[2150.3s] It does.

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2151.1s] It does.

[2151.8s] It does, and then that's really a failure, as you say, on delivery of the holistic platform—that you do need something which is absolutely better, right?

[2171.0s] It's just like a product question, really, right?

[2173.4s] It's saying, unless the product that you are offering is absolutely better than something existing,

[2181.9s] or is cheaper or gives you some other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use it.

[2189.3s] It doesn't matter what your worldview is behind that.

[2195.9s] You've given them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

Texture:**
[2199.2s] Yeah, and so, you know, I think exchanges and things like that kind of acting as a buffer is, you know, it's a step.

[2210.2s] I mean, you know, ultimately, how are these things going to be used?

[2216.1s] The end user is probably not going to know, you know,

[2220.3s] what they're using on the back end any more than the average person knows what processor is in their phone.

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2225.9s] So no—no, I mean, I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing, right?

[2230.9s] That, you know, in the same way as you've got those DeFi primitives, that you're going to layer this, you know, whatever—social recovery or buffered amounts or whatever, or insurance for fuck-ups or all this sort of stuff, right?

[2244.6s] That you should be able to put together

[2247.4s] a stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience to existing things, but without that strong dependence on, you know, a single legal entity—so that you've got that customer service provider kind of pattern, rather than just it being raw, dangerous as you experienced there.

Texture:**
[2270.4s] Yeah.

[2271.1s] And I mean, you know, to this day, I mean—

[2274.8s] I feel anxious all the time because I hold crypto, you know? Me—I feel anxious all the time.

[2281.6s] You know what I mean?

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2283.4s] I think we all—I think we all do.

Texture:**
[2285.0s] So it's like, that's not an experience that the average person wants.

[2287.7s] The average person wants to put their money in a bank account.

[2291.0s] The average person wants to click a button.

[2292.7s] And if something goes wrong, to be able to reverse it.

[2298.4s] Again, it's just a—it's a failure because the people who are in charge think, like,

[2304.1s] anyone can do what they're doing.

[2305.5s] And it's not that big of a deal.

[2307.0s] And like, all you have to do is do this—and like, blah, blah, blah.

[2309.9s] It's like, no. All they have to do is click a button.

[2313.3s] You've done it.

[2314.7s] That's—that's your metric for success.

[2316.6s] Click one button and not worry about anything.

[2320.9s] You just know the thing is going to happen.

[2322.3s] And if it doesn't, it'll get fixed.

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2325.2s] Yeah.

[2325.8s] Yeah.

[2327.6s] So I mean, when I was looking through, um—

[2331.0s] sort of the different phases of this period that I've been covering in the early days of Ethereum website—

[2341.1s] I was noticing—so in January and February 2014, there was just such a flood of people that came in.

[2351.4s] I mean, there were a fair chunk in December, but that just really accelerated through January and February.

[2359.6s] So I mean, how did that play out—that you just got like tons and tons of people, you know, rocking up and really like volunteering?

Texture:**
[2373.7s] It turned everything into Game of Thrones.

[2377.0s] Yeah, that's what happened.

[2378.9s] It turned everything into Game of Thrones.

[2380.5s] So, like, I was there day one.

[2382.6s] I was doing—I was making sure like, you know, first thing I did was—

[2387.9s] Vitalik posted this website that he made—it was piss yellow.

[2391.8s] He had stolen some other shitcoin's logo and just put Ethereum on it. And I was like, please don't post this. Give me till tomorrow.

[2401.6s] So I, like, spun up a logo, sent it to him.

[2407.0s] He was like, oh yeah, this is kind of what I was thinking.

[2408.9s] I was like, thank God. Please don't put that out.

[2413.1s] I don't know if I made a website and then somebody submitted an image, but the image was like—like—

[2416.8s] and so just real quick, like, what I used to do is I used to be like the dude who dev shops would call when they were six months behind on a project and they needed it done in three days.

[2430.5s] Right?

[2431.6s] So I was a designer, full-stack developer.

[2433.9s] So my skill was: I could take your idea and I could—I could make it look like it existed forever,

[2439.4s] and you had $10 million in funding in 24 hours.

[2443.1s] Right?

[2444.3s] So that was my goal at that point.

[2446.7s] Once I realized that that was a massive gap, I just inserted myself there.

[2452.4s] And I'm only telling the story to say: then when everybody flooded in—and especially when the Zug house happened—

[2461.9s] you had all these people kind of going behind other people's backs and trying to push people out and take over their roles.

[2468.9s] And it was just a very stressful, weird time because—

[2473.1s] you just get a different type of person.

[2477.1s] The type of people who show up and just want to build the thing because it's cool—that's one type of person.

[2482.7s] But when they show up and they're like, “Yeah, let's make sure it's us,

[2489.4s] let's make sure we're the ones,

[2490.6s] let's fuck those people,

[2491.9s] let's not communicate with them,”—

[2493.1s] so there was a lot of political maneuvering that was required to survive.

Vitalik Buterin:**
[2499.4s] Yeah, and I mean, I guess that Miami house was where that really dug in.

[2505.8s] Because that was the first time that most people were physically in the same location out of that set of people.

Texture:**
[2511.6s] It was pretty fun.

[2512.6s] The weirdest part about that was meeting Charles.

[2514.9s] And Charles—he might have been the first person who was doing kind of the thing that I just said, right?

[2524.1s] Yeah, just showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like “I'm gonna be CEO.” And I'm like…

[2529.3s] He was just—he's just a fucking liar though, man.

[2532.0s] He was like 24 or something and he presented—

[2533.9s] yeah, he presented himself like he was 50 years old and he'd been in tech forever.

[2538.0s] And here's the thing, man:**

[2541.2s] I actually was probably the most experienced in terms of—I had lived in Silicon Valley.

[2547.8s] I'd worked in multiple startups.

[2551.0s] But—

[2551.9s] Despite my personality on Twitter, or even if you meet me in person—I'm pretty humble when I get into a group of people that I can tell have skills.

[2563.2s] So I just sat back—I didn't try to insert myself.

[2567.3s] I didn't try to demand

[2570.2s] I be involved in this or that.

[2571.6s] I just tried to kind of be as helpful as I could.

[2573.9s] So, you know, when I talked to Charles for the first time, I was like, all right, you know, this is kind of weird—like, but we'll see what's up.

[2585.7s] So like literally the moment I met him in Miami, I shook his hand and I was like, oh god—he’s a fucking sociopath.

[2593.4s] Like, OK. Well, maybe he's our sociopath.

[2596.4s] You know, like every company has a sociopath.

[2599.2s] Like maybe he's like a well-regulated sociopath.

[2602.5s] And then when we got to the Miami house, I found out, no, no—he's not a well-regulated sociopath.

[2608.7s] He's a fucking compulsive liar, manipulative weirdo.

[2612.2s] Aaron, were you going to say something?

Aaron Davis:**
[2617.2s] I was just going to say, in Charles's defense—at that time, he did look 50 years old.

[2622.5s] He got away with it.

Texture:**
[2626.3s] Bro, when I found out he was like fucking seven years younger than me—I was like, what the—why am I deferring to this kid?

[2633.5s] He's like, what the hell?

[2635.9s] Um, so yeah, it was weird, man—like in the Miami house—

[2642.7s] he just said some of the weirdest shit to me.

[2645.8s] There was some thing from—I don’t know,

[2647.8s] I won't go into too many details.

[2649.3s] I've covered them and given interviews to people who have reported on it, but not under my name—

[2655.3s] so I guess to shield me from any sort of retribution.

[2659.8s] But I—

[2661.4s] It was weird, man.

[2662.7s] He just said some weird shit to me. Like he showed me—I'll tell this one, because I've told it publicly a lot of times—but he was like, "Texture, come here," and I’m like, "What’s up?"

[2669.0s] And he's like, "Check out this text message," and I’m like OK.

[2670.7s] And I had just met the dude.

[2672.1s] He shows me this text message and it's a chick and she's like, "I want to suck your cock so bad."

[2680.1s] Sorry for any children listening.

[2685.6s] I'm like, why the fuck is he showing me this?

[2687.4s] And he's like, "You know where I met her?"

[2688.6s] I was like, no.

[2690.4s] He's like, "I met her on the front lines of Afghanistan when I was working for DARPA."

[2695.4s] I'm like, Jesus Christ, dude.

[2697.0s] Oh my God.

[2697.8s] Shut the fuck up.

[2699.3s] And so I will say this because it's something that bothers me:**

[2702.5s] like, for some reason the media all says that the reason that Charles was kicked out was because he wanted to do business and not a nonprofit.

[2710.5s] And like, Charles got kicked out because he was a fucking weirdo sociopath who didn't do anything—

[2715.6s] like, above board—and like, couldn't be trusted.

[2719.6s] He didn't—he played games with everybody. Like, I was not in his inner circle because I—

[2727.8s] I didn't—like, he would do—what I call sociopath tests.

[2728.0s] Where like they say something fucked up to see how you respond.

[2731.5s] They'll ask you to do unreasonable things to see if you'll do them.

[2735.6s] And then the people that do them, and do them without question, end up being in his inner circle.

[2739.6s] They become the people—which he's continued on in his Cardano...

[2743.9s] So like—

[2744.7s] You know, he—he just operates in such a way that he gets sycophants around him.

[2749.8s] He lies to them.

[2750.7s] He gets them into situations where they're like loyal to him and they don't question him.

[2755.7s] And then, you know, just weaves a whole reality around that that isn't real.

[2762.0s] And that’s—my assessment of Charles.

[2764.4s] And he was not kicked out because of business.

[2768.6s] I mean, it was a cluster.

[2769.5s] Now—

[2770.4s] Yeah.

[2771.1s] I mean, no one else was kicked out.

[2772.9s] Let's just say that.

[2775.7s] I guess Amir left, but that’s another story.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2898.7s] Sending somebody off—who had a wife there, a girlfriend—and telling them that they had to go do this thing for him out of town.
[2907.8s] And then when that person had left, he then tried to convince one of the other dudes to, like, get with the dude's wife.
[2913.8s] Like just weird stuff, man.
[2915.9s] Just things that—
[2919.1s] Why would you do that?
[2920.1s] You know what I mean?
[2920.5s] You have an opportunity of a lifetime.
[2921.9s] The answer is you're a fucking idiot who lied yourself into a situation you shouldn't be in, and you are a compulsive
[2927.8s] lying manipulator.
[2929.0s] I'm sure it makes him feel smart or something.
[2931.2s] I don't know.
[2931.6s] But like, it was just—the stories... when he was gone after the Red Wedding, I think everybody breathed a sigh of relief.
[2939.9s] You know, the biggest problem for me was after the fundraiser, after the Red Wedding—
[2946.5s] Stephan, who I had introduced, or I had welcomed into the organization.
[2953.8s] And again, there was a lot of political stuff.
[2955.4s] If you went to Zug, you basically got put up in the hierarchy.
[2961.3s] So I ended up under Stephan.
[2962.9s] I couldn't go to Zug because my girlfriend was pregnant, and I couldn't leave to go to Zug for a month.
[2968.9s] And yeah, I don't know.
[2975.2s] Stephan was—
[2976.4s] I don't know—
[2977.7s] High-energy, high-anxiety dude.
[2979.4s] It was a weird thing.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2984.1s] Enya was smoking the stereotypical amount of cigarettes at the time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2989.3s] The stereotypical amount?
[2990.5s] That dude lived—he had a vape that he puffed.
[2996.0s] Oh, you're right.
[2997.8s] It was a vape.
[2998.8s] It was a vape.
[3000.2s] It was clouds of smoke.
[3001.8s] And so I went, you know, with Devcon Zero—I went and spent a week with them in the office in London.
[3009.5s] And dude, Stephan—if you weren't having a fucking panic attack, Stephan couldn't tell you were working.
[3018.0s] It was crazy. And he would pace around this co-working space like nobody else was there. Just—
[3025.0s] The whole place looked like a fucking rave, dude. I think he got kicked out because he was trying to film a TV show and vaping too much. And he had bought like $50,000 worth of camera equipment because his dream was to start a TV show or something. On the Ethereum budget.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3047.0s] Yeah, I heard that London location was pretty special.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3052.6s] It was weird, man.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3057.5s] Did you say you were never in Zug?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3059.9s] I never—no, I never went.
[3061.7s] My girlfriend at the time was pregnant.
[3066.0s] I had spent a month in Panama with Erik Voorhees and his team while she was pregnant.
[3071.0s] So honestly, in retrospect—it’s hard to know how things would have played out. Because of the political stuff—
[3081.4s] I was not political.
[3083.0s] I didn't have any strategy.
[3085.5s] I was not prepared for any of that shit.
[3088.2s] I just tried to be the most authentic, trustworthy, do-what-I-say kind of person. Good to everybody.
[3095.6s] That’s how I survived as long as I did.
[3097.6s] I don't really do politics.
[3100.1s] I really don't.
[3101.7s] All that stuff was really weird.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3107.4s] I mean, all of this was prior to both the crowdsale and—
[3115.2s] the formation of the Ethereum Foundation, right?
[3120.3s] So the Red Wedding was 3rd of June 2014, where you had that, I guess, that final decision of the foundation happening versus the for-profit.
[3144.2s] We had people coming—notably Anthony Di Iorio—coming to Zug at that point to sign papers.
[3152.5s] It was to do with that Swiss legal entity.
[3157.6s] And then it was like—yep, no, we're not signing the papers.
[3162.3s] Big mess.
[3163.5s] And then the foundation—
[3165.2s] was July—that was incorporated. And you still had the crowdsale ongoing through July and August.
[3173.5s] So yeah, that’s a hell of a long span of time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3177.2s] Yeah.
[3178.8s] We kept saying, “Two weeks.”
[3179.9s] I don’t know.
[3180.2s] That was a meme for a very long time.
[3182.0s] “Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks.”

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3187.3s] Well, the website that was up at the time of the Miami conference was showing a countdown to the 1st of February.
[3195.3s] That was when the sale was going to start.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3197.2s] Yeah.
[3198.7s] And then—you know—I was with Vitalik when the sale was launched.
[3203.9s] We had hung out all day in San Francisco.
[3206.1s] We were in the Westfield Mall in the food court—for Wi-Fi. He needed Wi-Fi and he was just sitting there. He just looked up at me, and he goes, “Oh, the crowdsale went live.”
[3215.5s] Because that wasn’t planned. I don’t know if Taylor talked to you about that when you hired him.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3228.6s] That was an accidental launch, was it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3230.8s] It was an accident.
[3231.9s] I don’t know.
[3232.2s] You have to ask Taylor about that.
[3233.5s] But yeah—he accidentally hit the button.
[3238.5s] Because, you know—it was legal.
[3239.8s] Like, that’s what kept happening.
[3240.9s] They kept saying: “We’re waiting on legal. We’re waiting on legal.”
[3244.9s] Fuck legal, in retrospect, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3250.4s] So you and Kieran must have met each other a little bit.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3254.5s] Yeah.
[3254.8s] Various times.
[3255.9s] Yeah, we’ve actually hung out more probably in the last five years than we did back then.
[3264.6s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3267.1s] And I guess that, Kieran, you saw more of that sort of New York-y legal side of things.

**SPEAKER_03 (Kieran):**
[3274.8s] Yeah. So, okay, this is a good tie-in point.
[3277.8s] So—and Bob, at your request, of course—I was digging through the emails, trying to piece together some pieces of the timeline, you know, yesterday or the day before.

[3288.0s] I think by March, I was talking with Vitalik, and I was in academia at that time.
[3300.7s] And he kind of found it useful to balance like protocol/economic modeling stuff.
[3307.6s] I was good at reading the white papers and understanding what they were doing.
[3314.4s] I could, you know, kind of code at that time—I can still kind of code today.
[3317.9s] But we ended up talking about how the thing should work at a theoretical protocol level more than an implementation level.

[3327.9s] That kind of—
[3329.9s] I guess—and this was covered during the Red Wedding time—there was a discussion of the usage of funds that ended up on a whiteboard or something.
[3341.7s] A lot of it was theoretically earmarked for a research group meant to solve hard problems like scalability in crypto.
[3352.0s] You know, like in practice, people have sort of solved that today—not by any of the means we imagined exactly—
[3362.6s] but they’ve been solved to some degree at least.
[3367.6s] Like with Layer 2s, for instance.
[3370.8s] So scalability was very much anticipated as a problem.
[3376.3s] And it took a couple years—but, you know, we had $55 fees on NFT transfers at some point.

[3382.3s] So I think Vitalik sort of—
[3388.4s] We talked about this for a little bit, and then he kind of blessed me as the representative who was currently in academia.
[3400.4s] I started contacting people and trying to get them interested in Ethereum and doing research related to it in general.
[3408.0s] We even set up a legal entity
[3409.9s] for a separate research group at some point.

[3413.1s] And I’m trying to remember—so, Texture, we mostly worked together just on the site, basically.
[3418.7s] I guess you were like, you know, the go-to web designer at that time. But I’m trying to remember.

[Transcript continues...]

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3995.3s] You're saying the guy with the most business experience did the best?
[4000.6s] So it seems.
[4002.7s] What's funny, when I met your dad in the Miami house, I just thought he was somebody's dad.
[4009.8s] I mean, obviously, in retrospect, he was yours.
[4012.3s] But I didn't know that he would go on to become Joe Lubin.
[4016.4s] I just remember shooting the shit with him and talking to him about thoughts and stuff.
[4019.7s] And he was real quiet.
[4023.5s] You know, told me about his time making music videos in Jamaica or whatever.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[4028.8s] Yeah, that was right after that.
[4030.6s] He also, for a time, believed that he would be a software developer for Ethereum.
[4036.7s] And then I guess he realized,
[4038.7s] like, no one knew anything about business.
[4041.3s] And, uh, you know, he’d done a tour in corporate from the IT side and then run a hedge fund.
[4048.3s] So he most understood how things worked, I guess.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4051.8s] Yeah.
[4052.1s] Much better than everyone else.
[4054.3s] I knew how to, uh, exist in a fucking early-stage startup.
[4057.9s] Because I had been doing that for 10 years over and over.
[4063.9s] So my major contribution was not saying, "Have you guys ever heard of a four-year vesting period?"
[4069.7s] I thought it a bunch and I was like, I don't want to be here for four years.
[4077.2s] I'm not going to say that shit.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4080.9s] Yeah.
[4081.2s] I mean, it's something which I've seen people comment on a fair bit is, um, you know, the early contributor slice,
[4092.1s] which was 9.9% of the Ether, which was shared between the people who did contribute over those 10 months or so, is equal to the amount that the Ethereum Foundation received.
[4109.2s] So all of the developments of everything which happened after that July to the current date has had that same bucket.
[4121.5s] And, uh, you know, that is not a typical kind of setup for, you know, long-term success.
[4131.9s] Talk about the vesting—you know, as I look through a lot of these early people, they did their part and they moved on. But it would be nice if some people hung around some more.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4146.4s] Yeah, I mean, I think to some degree, that's why I'm still here in this space. That and the guilt of learning what people do with the things you create and feeling some sort of responsibility to kind of try to nudge in a direction, you know—but balancing that with my desire to be anonymous to the most degree that I can was difficult.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4172.0s] Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[4173.7s] I mean, it was something which came up, I think through sort of 2018, 2019 as well, was, um, the Foundation
[4184.7s] stiffing developers, essentially.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4187.9s] Um, I don't know.
[4189.2s] That didn't happen to me.
[4190.9s] Raise Vitalik.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4193.0s] No, no.
[4194.0s] It's all right for you early guys.
[4197.6s] But, uh—
[4199.7s] But yeah, what else... they have noted?
[4201.8s] Yeah, something which you've spoken about a little bit on Twitter as well is sort of like purges and palace politics and so on.
[4211.2s] Can you speak a little bit to about like the nature of the Foundation and the opaque nature of it and these kind of palace politics that you have going on?
[4222.6s] Like what's happening there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4225.9s] You mean in the last 10 years?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4229.8s] Right, right.
[4230.9s] I mean, because it's quite a contrast, right?
[4233.0s] In your Coinbase article, you were speaking about the contrast between your open, decentralized, collaborative space and the Foundation as an entity.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4246.2s] Yeah.
[4246.5s] So I think that it's difficult because if you look at—this is my personal assessment, how I think about the situation.
[4257.2s] If you look at the early days and you take all that political shit seriously, and you realize that Vitalik's basically like an 18-year-old kid in the middle of this...
[4266.7s] Like I was underprepared for the political shit, but I wasn't even the center of it.
[4270.3s] You know, Vitalik had to be pushed into this weird situation where all these sharks and snakes were around, and where Charles is
[4283.2s] acting some type of way.
[4284.3s] And then everyone else around him is vying for power.
[4288.8s] And that's a lot of stress, right?
[4292.0s] And so if I was thinking of it from Vitalik's perspective, to me, my primary goal for myself would be to insulate myself from those political games to the greatest degree possible, right?

[4305.3s] And so, you know,
[4308.6s] in some ways, it's kind of like the requirement to stay sane and the requirement to insulate yourself from people playing these games and trying to get to you is that you kind of have to anoint yourself king and do the thing that Charles did, which is surround yourself with people who are going to basically have, like, fealty to you, right?

[4331.6s] They're not there because they're trying to manipulate you or get one over on you.
[4336.0s] They're not there because, you know, they're not playing games behind your back that you're going to have to deal with.
[4341.8s] And I think that if you're trying to focus on your goal, in this kind of foundational structure, I just assume that every decision that's been made in the structure of the Foundation is
[4360.1s] based on kind of two principles.
[4361.7s] One is kind of the amorphous notion that a decentralized project shouldn't have a centralized control structure.
[4371.8s] And there's really some sort of kind of suicide urge that I see in the way that they structure it.
[4377.6s] Like, it could be an organization that exists for, you know,
[4382.4s] a thousand years if they organize it correctly, but they're trying as hard as they can, it seems, to make it disappear.
[4389.8s] And I think that that's incredibly misguided.
[4393.6s] I don't think there's any historical examples of anything like that happening.
[4398.0s] And I think that if the Foundation disappeared tomorrow, then all those power games—you know, the power vacuum—would just create fucking infinity of those power games until somebody stepped up and
[4409.4s] Ethereum becomes whatever the person who can kind of get that power position.
[4413.9s] So I think that, unfortunately, from my assessment, Vitalik’s need to keep himself sane and protected has not been done in such a way that the Ethereum Foundation necessarily serves the long-term survival of Ethereum.
[4438.1s] That's a major concern for me.
[4443.7s] So I don’t, I don’t—I think a lot of people might criticize the way it’s structured for reasons like—but I understand, man.
[4450.4s] Like, I’m not Vitalik, and I’ve had to deal with those power games, and they drive you crazy, man.
[4456.5s] They get in your way.
[4457.6s] They keep you from being able to focus on what you want to focus on.

[4460.8s] And I think not coming up through the traditional
[4465.9s] kind of Silicon Valley group…
[4473.7s] You know, when you come up in that, you're surrounded by people who have been in it and have survived for a long time, and they understand how to support founders and how to legally orchestrate these things.
[4487.7s] And I just don’t think that he had those people around him to protect him.
[4492.3s] You know, so I don't know—Ken, you got something to say?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[4495.8s] I wanted to compare Ethereum with Bitcoin, which I've seen some of the similar governance issues on Bitcoin, but it’s different.
[4506.4s] Right now, it feels pretty technologically stagnant.
[4511.5s] At a time, I knew a bunch of the core devs.
[4514.8s] We had a funny meetup once at a Berkeley restaurant, and a couple of them showed up.
[4525.6s] You know, Bitcoin technologically just doesn't really change, but there was a time where people were kind of—it was a foundation, and they were acting in a coordinated manner to popularize Bitcoin and so on.
[4536.9s] And now it feels like those people are largely gone.
[4541.9s] A lot of the work
[4546.3s] that adds functionality—that Bitcoin uses Ethereum or an L2 or an EVM or what have you.
[4551.9s] And people are just kind of focused on the price action pretty much.
[4557.8s] And that's been, I think, a benefit to Bitcoin, but I guess...
[4562.4s] I think Satoshi kind of went through something similar.
[4565.1s] And I think he was starting to get pretty irritated. There’s a good book covering his Bitcoin Talk posts and how that started to feel over time.
[4577.3s] And then obviously he disappeared when he disappeared.
[4580.1s] I'm just thinking like...
[4583.0s] Is the Ethereum way better?
[4584.9s] I think like probably it is.
[4587.7s] It's not optimal for sure.
[4589.1s] Like later projects run much closer to Silicon Valley tech companies and have the open-source part, where the open-source part is... but are pretty strongly governed so far as I can tell.
[4601.6s] But no, I think I also say like there's probably some merit to the approach.
[4606.0s] Like it was so decentralized that lots of people could come in and
[4610.3s] try to make it their own—and there was a plus to that too, and just the downside being the chaos.
[4616.5s] I don't know, what do you think about this question?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4619.3s] Yeah, I mean, I think—can you hear me?
[4622.0s] My little thing is not showing.
[4624.4s] You're good.
[4625.2s] Okay.
[4627.9s] Yeah, no, I think, you know, as far as the Foundation being set up in the beginning, it's whatever.
[4632.8s] What it's become is whatever too, because they could change into a structure that
[4638.8s] supports Ethereum for the long term.
[4640.3s] But...

[4643.7s] Yeah, I'm more focused on today. But I do think—you know, I always thank your dad every time I see him for all his work, because I do think he's filling a role.
[4653.2s] And if there is a power vacuum, you know, I think
[4658.1s] he will be standing around to at least mitigate it.
[4665.7s] Um, without him, who knows?

[4668.5s] But the thing about the Bitcoin thing you said is like—that's what I'm concerned is going to happen to Ethereum.
[4676.5s] As you get to a point where it just becomes this kind of not-coordinated thing where everybody's arguing and nothing happens.
[4686.5s] Right.
[4687.4s] And nobody can make a decision, because at the end of the day,
[4691.2s] groups don't make decisions.
[4693.2s] Groups don't create greatness.
[4695.5s] That's just not what happens.
[4697.6s] You have these kind of visionary geniuses, and if they manage to find the right idea and the right group and they're supported and they have the time and energy to do it,
[4709.3s] then it moves forward. You can even look at a more structured version like Apple,
[4716.2s] where it was, you know, Steve Jobs and he set up a massive corporate structure—and it still exists to this day and
[4725.6s] the vision is gone.
[4727.4s] Right.
[4727.6s] So once the kind of visionary is separated from the vision, and once—the—you know, it’s going to default back to the level of the organization.
[4737.4s] And if the goal of the Ethereum Foundation, as stated, is to make itself irrelevant, like... I mean, that's so frustrating, like...
[4753.0s] It could potentially allow this technology to create entire governance systems and corporate structures or whatever that could persist on the blockchain indefinitely with all kinds of mechanisms.
[4765.9s] And like, what the fuck?
[4766.9s] Is that not what the Ethereum Foundation should be doing?
[4769.5s] Should they not be eating their own dogfood?
[4771.6s] Should they not be doing what we said we were going to do?
[4774.3s] Should they not be funding that?
[4775.7s] Like, I mean, how many esoteric scaling solutions can you invest in?

UNKNOWN:**
[4782.4s] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4786.4s] Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, I think the change of leadership that there was this year with Thomas coming in as a co-ED has made a world of difference—that they have become more transparent than has been the case before.
[4809.4s] And I think that he, as—
[4812.4s] a Ethereum company CEO, because he's the CEO of Nethermind as well, I think has given him that kind of product, holistic, getting-shit-done kind of perspective that hasn't before.
[4830.1s] And he’s got the credibility of having been in the ecosystem as well, right?
[4833.6s] And having gone from, “Hey, we're a—
[4837.0s] You know, we're a little company doing an Ethereum client”—to a really large kind of player that do all kinds of things.
[4844.6s] And I think there hasn't been that before. You know, he is a CEO type.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4849.8s] He was... I did a call with him.
[4855.2s] We talked for a bit, and he seemed great—asked a lot of questions and said he had talked to over a hundred people.
[4864.3s] I gave him some of my thoughts and criticisms.
[4867.9s] And I don’t know, I’ve seen a lot of the things that we talked about kind of playing out.
[4873.1s] So, you know, I hope he can be a force that persists. Again, you know, if you have the palace politics, there's always the people like that—
[4883.6s] they're always in danger.

[4884.7s] So there might be another coup.

Texture:**
[4889.7s] That's what I'm saying.
[4891.1s] You could be the best guy with the best intentions, with the best ideas, and you're the guy to do it.
[4899.1s] And if the power structure is designed around placating people who are only concerned about their place in the palace...
[4908.8s] Um, you know, it's happened to me multiple times in my life.
[4913.5s] Uh, they kick you out because you're a threat to what they're trying to accomplish in their minds.
[4921.6s] Um, they don't understand that, you know, if you allow the—
[4925.5s] Guy, the guy who is doing this, to really create something that lasts and is bigger, then you're going to get a bigger slice from a bigger pie.
[4933.9s] But if you completely undermine everybody who's trying to do that, then you're going to end up with nothing, you know?

Unknown_Speaker:**
[4949.6s] I don't know if there's a mechanism for a coup.
[4953.9s] I assume, like in practice, the Foundation is, like, you know, kind of doing…
[4960.1s] Whatever the people who work for it want to do—but in the end—is a dictatorship of Vitalik at the end of the day. Like, yeah.

Texture:**
[4971.4s] So, yeah, the only mechanism I see is that the people who have Vitalik's ear get in his ear long enough that—
[4980.2s] You know, it's not working.
[4984.6s] So to some degree there might, you know, be a community capacity to be a louder voice consistently, to ensure that, you know, there will be backlash if anything like that happens.

Bob:**
[5001.3s] Yeah, I make this the sixth epoch that there's been.
[5006.4s] So we have: White Paper to Red Wedding—where it's essentially, you know, just no formal structures, really, you know, emergent.
[5016.4s] Then you have the period of the Ethereum Foundation and FDEV.
[5022.7s] So that was July 2014 through February 2015.
[5026.3s] Then you have the Interregnum, where you were whopped—
[5034.8s] Which was between March 2015 and June 2015—where you had Kelly Becker kind of, like, overseeing the installation of the new professional "in quotes" board, that began the Ming Dynasty—where she immediately knocked off all the other directors, and then she had her—
[5063.5s] Three years of tyranny.
[5068.0s] And then you had the Infinite Garden with Aya [Miyaguchi] coming in, in another coup there in February 2018.
[5077.4s] And then it seems this last one was maybe not so much of a coup as an evolution, in that Aya’s still around as the president, but you have new executive leadership.
[5088.5s] So, yeah, I don't know what this period comes to be called, but it's—it's definitely better and more coherent.

Texture:**
[5095.4s] You know, I—I'm prescient a lot of the time, and, you know, I had my encounters with Aya that clued me into the fact that she was not really qualified or—
[5112.9s] Even coherently involved in a way that I would assume somebody in her position would be.
[5117.9s] So I was, you know, I was applying pressure years ago—years and years ago.
[5124.5s] And yeah, five years ago—six years ago.
[5129.1s] So I think, you know, eventually the community kind of—
[5133.3s] Came around to what I've been saying this whole time, which is: Wait, like, she should be doing—like, there's things that need to be done, and we all see that they're not being done. And what the fuck?
[5144.1s] And we can't even—this woman doesn't seem to care. And she keeps talking about esoteric poetry and fucking Infinite Gardens—what is this shit? You know, like—
[5153.4s] Fucking do your job.
[5154.9s] Like, you know, for me—the, you know, I've talked about it before—but you know, their website. The website was like the same website for three years.
[5162.9s] It was just an informational website.
[5164.8s] It was a brochure website.
[5166.4s] And I just messaged her and said, “Hey, man...
[5169.1s] We, uh, we need to update this website.
[5171.8s] I'll do it for free.”
[5173.2s] And she said, “Oh yeah, I think we have a team working on that.
[5176.8s] Let me get back to you.”
[5178.0s] So I, like, kept in contact with her.
[5179.8s] It took her six months—six months—to figure out who was working on the website, Bob.
[5186.6s] I mean, like, are you fucking kidding me?
[5189.6s] Like, what are you doing?
[5190.3s] Are you sitting at the beach, like, sipping Mai Tais?
[5194.0s] I legitimately don't know what you're doing, because you clearly have no—
[5198.3s] Active—
[5199.1s] This is how this is—what it should be:**
[5200.5s] You should have an org chart.
[5201.7s] You should fucking know the person to call.
[5203.4s] You should actually know who's building your website.
[5207.1s] Yeah.
[5207.9s] So that was just insane to me, that you could be the ostensible—roughly—running an organization, and not even know who to contact to see who is building the website.
[5220.1s] And then it ultimately was Josh Stark.
[5221.9s] I messaged him, said, “Hey, man, I’d love to help.
[5225.0s] I'll do it for free.
[5226.2s] I can have it done in a week.”
[5227.8s] He was like, “No, I'm good.”
[5229.9s] I was like, “What do you mean you're good?
[5231.7s] You're not doing it.
[5233.6s] Like, nothing has happened.
[5234.8s] It's been six months.
[5236.5s] It's not something that takes six months or a year.”
[5238.9s] Anyways, it was like a year later—
[5240.1s] They finally launched—a year and a half later.
[5242.6s] So.

Bob:**
[5244.2s] There was a longer tweet thread of me ranting a little bit—
[5249.7s] Well, it wasn't very ranty actually.
[5250.8s] It was quite polite—in late, in late—it was December 2017.
[5257.5s] And Hudson tweeted out something like, “Hey, what could Ethereum be doing better?”
[5265.7s] Or something like that.
[5267.4s] And it's like: Ah, well...
[5269.2s] Oh my god.
[5270.3s] But my list was very simple.
[5272.8s] It was like, yeah, the website's shit.
[5274.8s] It's useless.
[5275.3s] It doesn't do anything.
[5276.2s] There's no information—nothing there—nothing useful there.
[5281.3s] Also, there's no public information on the Ethereum Foundation.
[5286.9s] Who are the board members?
[5288.6s] How does voting work?
[5291.0s] Who are advisors to the Foundation?
[5294.4s] What teams are there?
[5295.9s] Who works on these teams?
[5298.7s] There wasn't even a grants program at that point either.
[5302.0s] It was just basically—you just had Ming and Vitalik.
[5308.8s] And she had hired on Jamie Pitts and Hudson.
[5313.8s] So there was a little bit of extra help.
[5316.3s] But essentially it was that thin little bit of overhead and a bunch of devs.
[5322.7s] And that was what there was.
[5325.2s] And she couldn't delegate either—Ming.
[5328.1s] So just nothing got done.
[5329.7s] Like, really—just nothing got done at all.

Texture:**
[5332.3s] Yeah.
[5333.5s] Yeah.
[5333.8s] I mean, I don't know. In retrospect, if I had known that—
[5336.4s] I mean, I know you said she was a nightmare, but she did offer to hire me back into the Ethereum Foundation.
[5341.5s] But I didn’t feel it was a time where I really felt like working.
[5350.6s] I’d been a little burnt out from the previous few years.
[5353.4s] So, yeah.
[5355.2s] You know, maybe if I’d have accepted that...

Bob:**
[5359.2s] She should have Minged you.
[5361.5s] Don’t worry, you wouldn’t have lasted long if she came back.

Texture:**
[5364.1s] Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[5365.4s] Everyone got Minged.
[5367.2s] If she was like Stephan, then yeah—that high-energy, like, stress stuff.
[5372.2s] But I don’t know.
[5374.3s] I was a little bit more...

Bob:**
[5375.2s] But yeah, I mean, you know, so I think that was the problem.
[5379.9s] You hadn't got enough people to get anything done. Like what you talked about with Aya—
[5384.6s] That was the case in that earlier era as well.
[5388.7s] There wasn’t really any organizational structure and nothing really much was happening beyond the developers doing their development.
[5395.4s] Oh, and we’ll do a Devcon now and then.

Texture:**
[5397.9s] Yeah.
[5398.7s] Well, you asked about the palace politics thing, and I just had a memory.
[5402.5s] You know, people—it’s much less now than it used to be—
[5405.5s] But to some degree, people still keep me in the loop when, you know, they know things.
[5410.5s] So I think maybe the biggest problem with the way that things are structured right now is that—
[5418.5s] There is nobody to give pushback.
[5421.9s] And there's no dissenting voices.
[5424.9s] And there's a, like a—
[5428.0s] Very homogenous group of people—
[5432.2s] Homogeneous, whatever the word is—a group of people who—
[5440.3s] Aren’t going to step out of the party line for any reason because they’re going to be afraid of being pushed out. And I think that’s not necessarily good.
[5450.1s] Obviously you can’t have people following you around who think their only job is to—
[5455.8s] Undermine anything you say, but really, I mean, you need voices that will speak the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable.
[5464.8s] Because, you know, decisions—they have outcomes.
[5468.4s] And having a bunch of people who see the world in the same way and aren’t really thinking of things holistically or from different perspectives—
[5475.5s] You know, it's going to create issues.

Bob:**
[5484.2s] At the recent FCC in Cannes, there was a slide which Jérôme had on there, which was talking about dissenting voices.
[5497.1s] And both myself and Greg Colvin were up there as Ethereum dissidents.

Texture:**
[5502.7s] I didn’t get it.
[5503.3s] It’s all right.
[5504.5s] Nobody remembers me.
[5506.0s] Congrats though.

Bob:**
[5507.4s] No, sorry.
[5511.0s] You’re not—you’re not known enough.
[5511.5s] Oh, no. You’re not—you’re not being loud enough.

Texture:**
[5514.7s] No, it’s all right.
[5517.2s] I only have the number of followers I do because of a couple of jokes.
[5520.7s] I made—one of them being Texture Punks.
[5523.3s] I—I very much don’t mind being lost to history if it means I’m not on someone’s "let's rob this guy" list.

Bob:**
[5534.2s] Well, I think that’s maybe a good kind of place to wrap up.
[5540.3s] Yeah, don’t worry.
[5541.5s] I wish you all the very best and enjoy your life.

Texture:**
[5548.8s] Yeah.
[5549.5s] Well Bob, thanks for having me on.
[5550.6s] If you want to have me on again, I’m more than happy to always give you my time.
[5556.7s] Good to talk to you, Kieran.

Kieran:**
[5559.0s] A pleasure.
[5560.0s] It’s been—not too long, but no...
[5564.6s] Yeah, great.
[5565.6s] Great to chat again.
[5566.4s] And we’ll do again soon.

Texture:**
[5567.6s] Yeah, maybe—maybe so.
[5568.9s] Maybe we’ll see you soon.
[5570.3s] And then thanks for everybody who’s come to listen.
[5573.5s] And yeah, don’t follow me.

Bob:**
[5577.8s] Okay.
[5579.6s] Thanks a lot.
[5580.3s] So yeah, Texture is @iamtexture on Twitter.
[5584.8s] Have you got any other—

[5586.9s] Websites or anything—places that you’d like to point people?

Texture:**
[5591.7s] No, I'm not.
[5592.9s] No.
[5594.2s] Just have a nice night.
[5597.1s] Have a nice day, wherever you’re at—morning.

Bob:**
[5601.0s] Thanks so much.
[5602.6s] Okay.

Texture:**
[5603.4s] Cheers everyone.
[5604.5s] Bye.
[5605.7s] Bye.
