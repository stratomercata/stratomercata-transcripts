**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:00] Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today.
[00:03] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain.
[00:08] Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[00:10] Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone.
[00:12] Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:14] John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:17] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[00:23] Yeah, sure.
[00:24] So yeah, let's see. My crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call.
[00:32] Before that, my background was kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[00:39] I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[00:48] So yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:54] Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[00:57] Obviously, we met there, but like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[01:00] Yeah, so I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
[01:03] I had actually met—I think John Lilic, which I forgot—but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center.
[01:08] I don't know if you guys remember that.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[01:10] Yeah, we do.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[01:11] Yeah, so I was hanging around and actually I was super into Counterparty.
[01:15] So I was very much like, Ethereum is too complicated. You know, Vitalik's full of shit. It's not going to work.
[01:21] And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong. This is actually super cool.
[01:26] I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing.
[01:30] And I was just Googling "Ethereum blockchain hacking." I was trying to find a way to get deeper involved.
[01:35] I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
[01:38] And so then I think I just Googled it and it was like, oh, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[01:42] And I applied with Charles and then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[01:45] Yeah. And to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project.
[01:50] And we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[01:54] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Exactly.
[01:56] I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:01] Yeah. I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were...

**SPEAKER_06:**
[02:04] Yeah, exactly. There was like a couple-week consulting transition period while, you know...

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:08] Yeah, I think that's true.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[02:09] Yeah. Maybe it was like we started hourly, getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:13] Yeah. So with Counterparty, you could have been on Chris DeRose tech.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[02:16] Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:18] So what inspired SuperRare?
[02:20] I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[02:26] But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[02:33] Yeah, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[02:36] We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
[02:41] Watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[02:44] I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens.
[02:48] I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard, super simple protocol, very simple code.
[02:54] But the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[02:57] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
[03:03] It was incredible to see that happen.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[03:06] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
[03:12] And I was like, well, this is pretty crazy.
[03:14] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[03:19] So it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
[03:23] I didn't know exactly what the business model was going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[03:29] So that got me into NFTs.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[03:31] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs.
[03:36] I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
[03:41] And it just seemed obvious.
[03:43] I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets.
[03:47] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[03:50] So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[03:56] And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion?
[03:59] Because I know for a long time you were building and it was like, oh, how's it going?
[04:03] And no one is really paying attention.
[04:05] And all of a sudden, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[04:09] It was absolutely crazy.
[04:11] It was just completely surreal the whole time. It felt like a dream.
[04:15] We started in 2018. We tried to raise money. It never really worked.
[04:20] By the time we raised, we were already cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:25] That's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[04:27] Yeah, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[04:32] So it was a grind. It was super volatile.
[04:35] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[04:38] But then it just really started.
[04:40] I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while.
[04:43] October 2020 was our first million-dollar month in volume.
[04:47] And I was just like, this is wild.
[04:49] Because 12 months ago, we were like, all right, the volume was $5,000.
[04:53] We made a couple hundred bucks.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:55] And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[04:58] I think—we're trying to talk about that actually.
[05:01] There were maybe a couple other minting tools, but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience.
[05:07] There weren't great minting tools then.
[05:09] So we started with the minting tool and then were like, all right, I guess people need a place to sell this.
[05:13] So we'll build the marketplace too.
[05:15] And it was partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.
