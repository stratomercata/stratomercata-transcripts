SPEAKER_00:
Okay, recording is in. Pro is in progress. It says so. Hello everybody. Today. Delighted to have Christoph Jens with us. We did attempt to record this, Christoph and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded. So this is round two. Hello Christoph, how are you?

SPEAKER_01:
Hi everyone.

SPEAKER_02:
Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope. You too. Thanks for the invitation.

SPEAKER_00:
Fantastic. Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C Ethereum on my smartwatch. And this was around the time that Christoph was. Was still at the. At the Ethereum Foundation. And then I think our cross paths have crossed a number of times since and. And Kieran's too.

SPEAKER_01:
Indeed.

SPEAKER_00:
So. So Christoph, what. What were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

SPEAKER_02:
So in the journey started in 2013. I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics actually about self-organizing systems. So like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things. So I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior and I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency. And. But the, the reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs like graphic cards and the bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later AS6. And so that's how I got into what's bitcoin mining. And so I bought my first bitcoin, got into this bubble, did read everything I could about it and then I came across the white paper From Vitalik, early 2014, something like January, February in some bitcoin forum somewhere. And I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decent currency and all the characteristics and features of it. And this white paper of Vitalik, and if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy, except of NFTs. Everything is in there from DAOs, from ENS, like names, domain name systems and all of that. So for me it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but just not a currency but everything else. And so then I started reading everything about it. And in 2000, actually still 2014, in summer, I read the crowd sale was in 2014. Right, right, yeah, the crowd sale. So around the time the crowd sale happened, I read did watch a video from Gavin Woods. He was somewhere in the Scandinavics some conference there. The Nordics and he talked about Ethereum. I loved it. And he said, you want to open up an office in Berlin looking for C plus plus developers. I was a C plus plus developer so in territory physics it's 90 software development. So I said well I want to do this. So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation time from and passed my PhD for like three or six months and said I will return after I'm done. I thought this is just a short project because they raised money maybe six, maybe maybe 12 months, 18 months or so, then it's over. When I started I thought about maybe three to six months and then I go back to my PhD. So I work there with Ethereum is Kevin Wood was a great time and then just decided to stay. Was so exciting.

SPEAKER_00:
So. So you never got to be a doctor?

SPEAKER_02:
No, I'm not a doctor. I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left which was kind of a pity. I worked like for three years on that and. But I also had at the time, I think four or five kids. I needed some money. I didn't get much money as a PhD student so I did software development as a side hustle basically. And so when I got this project I said well let's do this for two or three months as a parent believe time and then I can return. And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD is that I will maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation will eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits, they just raised donations, then they will spend them and then it's over. Then I can continue my PhD. That was originally a plan, just came different.

SPEAKER_00:
I mean I guess it's never too late, right.

SPEAKER_02:
I actually sometimes think about if I should return. It's just so much to learn again I'm right now doing tokenize it. I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies. It works, works very well. So currently I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

SPEAKER_00:
No, because I mean famously you had, you know, Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian Wrightweisner as well and I think, I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well.

SPEAKER_02:
There was definitely.

SPEAKER_01:
I also dropped out of mine. I was actually in mathematical physics too. Interesting similar background.

SPEAKER_02:
It's actually the same like theoretical physics. It's the mathematical part of physics. I enjoyed it very much. I did thermodynamics and statistics mostly. Software development was really fun.

SPEAKER_01:
Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join. I don't know there's anything that needs Happening he gets some browser.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, yeah, well he'll pop up and we can add him or if he's. Then never mind. So Christoph in terms of getting hired into fdev and I'm sorry if I just missed it. So how, how did that happen? Did you meet Gav at a meetup? Did you say?

SPEAKER_02:
Yes, I actually, I listen only to his talk as for the online thing and I actually just wrote him an email, said look, I see this last developer would love to join Ethereum, love what you're doing. And he invited me to meet me in Kreuzberg Berlin, so which again is about two hours drive from here. So I went up there, met him. I remember the first conversation he was talking about all the stuff they were going to build and said well what, what can you do? And I just asked him what's like the most complicated stuff you have right now, like give me a complicated task, I somehow can figure it out. So he talked about the Ethereum virtual machine which needed some testing. Jim. So, so I just picked working on testing the Ethereum virtual machine or like writing test for it. Back at the time I actually had no real idea what he was talking about. Meaning of course I did understand on the white paper level I didn't understand what Ethereum was about. But Gavin had this skill of writing the yellow paper which is still incredible work. Like it's a such a great specification, different from Bitcoin really having a specification so multiple clients could be built. And in there he defined the Ethereum virtual machine. And I, I think I read the paper six, seven times. I felt like I was one out of don't know, 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood the yellow paper. I did corrections to it. I have some pull requests actually in the yellow paper GitHub repo added missing definitions and stuff like that. And then what I mostly did was writing test according to the specification which then were with the help of the C client because this was his teams. I was working also on the C code base and so gas PI, Ethereum, also the JavaScript version and what else do we have like five Haskell client and others. They're basically using my test to see if they are implemented Ethereum virtual machine also the state translations and block creation correctly.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, yeah. So I mean just just to have some timeline for the, for the viewers. So Vitalik wrote the white paper in November 2013. Various other people sort of joined in on the efforts in December, including Gav and Jeff who started the C and Go clients Respectively at the very end. Oh my goodness, At the very end of December kind of Christmas projects for them both. January 2014 you had sort of like the, the public announcement of Ethereum at the, at the Bitcoin Miami conference. It was as early as April 2014 that Gav wrote the yellow paper which is, you know, as you were saying, the sort of formal specification. You had the crowd sale between July and September 2014. So then yeah, you, you were coming in right after that, you know, so you had a wave of arrivals in September and October of that year. Essentially because the crowd sale had happened. There was some money to actually hire people and then talking about, you know, where you. Where you met there initially that group. So FDEV were and is a company coordinating the development of of Ethereum stuff. So it's a subsidiary of the Ethereum Foundation. They were working initially in a co working space but then. And it was between August and November of that year that the Office was getting like, you know, done up and tidied. And then in November you had DEVCON 0, you know, the first conference, you know, an internal one where a lot of the people that was their first sort of face to face meeting. How was devcon zero? How was that? What was that like?

SPEAKER_02:
It was like a company retreat. So this was not a public conference. We did have even though there were some outsiders who felt like part of the community maybe also pushed some code. And I remember the. I was in his name again wrote the book also about Ethereum. Did Lexus from IBM. Yeah, I think he was also there just as an example of some people who are like reading about Ethereum. Interested in joining.

SPEAKER_00:
Of course Roman as well, right? Roman. Roman was there with the Java client.

SPEAKER_02:
But it was mostly developers. But also I think Stefan to all was already there. So we had already the London team. So it was like an internal Ethereum meeting. Kind of a meetup. Almost. Almost. I think three days or so. I don't know exactly five days even. So it was a full week. I was there for the full week as far as I can remember. I did a presentation about testing how the test suite is very important. Yes, we had to remix projects. Solidity Project I think mostly started during the time Gavin used this for a explaining his vision of what Ethereum as a platform for decentralized application. So building Swarm. I don't know if Swarm and Risper was already launched there but at least like the generic idea, the MIS browser. So all those ideas are really sketched out there like the technical roadmap. What we are going to build because we started just of course with the basic clients like implementing the protocol. But he took it like kind of what are we going to do in the next 12 months building the Mist browser, like remix of those tools to have a platform for decentralized applications. I remember one slide which I think I posted on Twitter a while ago, but you have those three circles, one circle is one node and you would see like they are connecting on the blockchain using Swarm for the data, whisper for the messages. And you like this whole picture was painted there and the people attending, I think around 50 people plus minus 10, don't know exact number where mostly developers talking about code coding there. Joseph, I remember him being there saying well all of you, you will create your own companies becoming millionaires. I remember CH was talking about that and I think mostly was he was right. So most of those people in the room in one way or another co founded, founded or early part of companies building on top of Ethereum in the years to come.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, yeah. So perhaps let's talk about actually just before we get to DEFCON 1. So the launch, right? So obviously a lot of testing and coordination and this different series of proof of concepts. So I mean how did you know it was good enough? Like what was that testing flow and collaboration?

SPEAKER_02:
Like there are many indicators. One being the Olympic testnet running smoothly for a while. Other one where as I said, decline having an audit, which worked. And then that was saying, okay, now if Kristoff doesn't find any failing tests for like three weeks or four weeks or something, we are ready. And this was the case. And so we said that now we can set the launch date. And the launch itself is also a bit typically, typically Gavin or also Vitalik. Nobody wanted to push a button like nobody just like start a chain. So what was done was there was a script written which has as an input parameter the hash of the Olympic test net at a certain block height. So everybody could using this script plus the software, plus C or go client of course having plus the hash which was at that time in the future of the big testnet, start that chain. So there was no at like at launch day. We were just viewing it. There was nothing to be done. Was like everything was everything. All the information was out there. People were just simultaneously starting the blockchain and then over the peer to peer network. This was actually more, more harder stuff. They found themselves on Reddit and others to share IP addresses like connect to miss. Connect to my peer. Connect to my peer. And so then they started to come together. And of course the longest chain was the valid one. So as soon as you found a peer which had their own chain, you would think and say well yes, this is a longer one. He would stop, stop mining on top of his chain. So basically the canonical chain emerged from that within I don't know, 30 minutes or one hour. And then we had the chain running. And this was like a beauty to behold. Like to just see how this works out as intended. Completely decentralized. Nobody did that do anything. You just. I was in the Z Berlin office in KBER M37. A nice office. And we just watched it. And we are somewhere mining there with their laptop. Wasn't really. And we are all excited. It started. I actually think. I think two or two or three weeks after, or maybe four, we had the first little hard fork. Meaning there was some smart contract doing something that gas and C plus plus had a different result. It was for me almost the middle of the night at 10pm or 11pm So I remember seeing this, looking for one hour or so, finding what's the. What's the issue. Then I found it, wrote a test about it. C was right, guess what's wrong. So gave it to Chef. They fixed this, I think within one hour. And like after five hours everything was done and they basically called out the miners, Please update your client. So. And then it was fine. So this was the early days, but it was a successful launch nevertheless.

SPEAKER_03:
Did the Haskell client sync at Genesis?

SPEAKER_02:
I do not know, Tim.

SPEAKER_03:
No, we. We were able to sync a Genesis time for like a year or so. We were sinking. But I remember like that week, Kieran and I were like more interested in trying to get a minor in place. So that was what that week looked like for us.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah, I had. I was living in a apartment just south of Berkeley campus at this time. And Jim had taken me to Fry's to build a machine a few months prior. Like a build machine. It had a good GPU in it.

SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, Fries is dead now, rip.

SPEAKER_01:
So I was running a miner there and we built a couple in Jim's garage. It got very hot in Jim's garage, which was, you know, those. Those things were consuming a fair bit of power. Mine exploded after a few weeks. It was actually just the power.

SPEAKER_02:
So I was.

SPEAKER_01:
I thought the whole machine was bricked. And Jim said, you know, I think everything but the power supply will be okay. And it was the case that everything with the power supply was okay. But then I stopped mining and I think Jim would shut.

SPEAKER_03:
We didn't even bother to buy cases at that time.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah, yeah, indeed. Sure you weren't over at that time? We were always, you know, sort of, at least at that time, shorter handed. People wise, always catching up a little bit on the features, etc. But it, it ran perfectly well.

SPEAKER_02:
There was always new features coming. I remember it was really one of the sweet memories during the pre launch sitting together with Gavin Vitalik, Jeffrey and me in one room at the C office, like the nice Kevin office. He had this 80s style thing and we think okay, what was wrong in our protocol? Then they discussed with a whiteboard changes. Then the first thing, okay, Christopher, you had a test for this protocol change. Then we are in the mean at the same time you're coding it that okay, you're done creating the test, let's see if they all pass it. If they all pass it, it's like done. You feature the directly new release. So this is because not done with all the other clients. So they basically had to catch up. It was like information update of the yellow paper. Here's a new test, here's like a little ether pad description of what the new protocol looks like and then please update your clients.

SPEAKER_03:
But yellow paper got me to a certain point.

SPEAKER_00:
Sorry.

SPEAKER_03:
Yellow paper always got me to a certain point but it was always behind the other, the other clients. So I would always find out that like I, I was behind because I went in the morning and connected to the test net and I was no longer connecting or I was getting some state route mismatch or something. And then I'd have to like go and dig through usually the C client. I think there was a maybe one or two times where I can't remember why. I think there was one or two things that went to get first, but usually it was C. I'd have to go digging through the newest code to find the changes and then bring them in. Then a few weeks later I'd see it in the yellow paper.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I mean at that point, as you say, it's. It's kind of like done in those clients first. And then speculator, it looked like from.

SPEAKER_03:
Where I was standing, it looked like there was a lot of competition between the different clients and the developers there. And I think they sort of like took pride in having the new thing in as fast as possible. And so that sort of led to an environment maybe where there was not, not as much discussion. It was like I'm gonna throw it in and then I get the bragging.

SPEAKER_02:
Rights that Was there was always a fight, guess last team about who's the best. And like Kevin was having a big ego and Jeff was more like just give it a, give it a new spec. I just coded. So. But yeah, it was more or less this decision by the three of them. I was basically not playing a very major role in the room and then writing a test for it. But they discussed it after it was clear, they just did it. But it was pre launch after launch. Of course this was different.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, yeah. So back on the timeline. So it was July 2015 that Mainnet launched with a frontier hard fork. And then as you touched on, you had Ming. So Ming's first official day was 1st August 2015, at which point the foundation had been running on for a year or so and was close to out of money. You know, touching on your, your thinking it would only last for a certain amount of time, you know, a year on that raise, which I think was around 16 or perhaps $18 million was nearly all gone. So you had these quite hard decisions about, you know, what, which part of this grand vision was, was going to be funded initially.

SPEAKER_02:
Right. And I remember talking to her at the time, she felt like I have to clean up the whole mess. Like the paperwork and everything was totally messy. Working with lawyers, accountants and so on and getting cleanup basically of the foundation, I mean for me I did expect it to last something like that. So it was, for me it was clear they are not making any money. I didn't know like how big the reserve was. The detail I think was like don't know, 5% something in this range, like how much easier the foundation hold. At the time there wasn't that much value either price like $0.50, €1 or something. So it was clear this would not last forever. So I was thinking about going back to my PhD or then I came across this idea about slock it and becoming like building a company. And Slocket was the idea of maybe similar to airlock. Smart contracts are essentially permission systems. 90% of a smart contract is who's allowed to do what. In case of an ERC20, it's just who's allowed to send a token or setting an allowance. And in terms of a DAO is who can vote for what and making decisions and then money gets transferred. So what if we could put this permission system into IoT and like who's allowed to switch on, off, use, change, admin rights, whatever. You put this into a small contract. And I thought that Ether will never become a currency. Bitcoin was a digital currency. And actually if you think it talk to Ethereum people at the time, we were not thinking about competing with Bitcoin. Bitcoin was a digital currency. We were building a platform for decentized applications. Ether was just used to run it. I once heard the statement somewhere on Twitter where once that Bitcoin is a currency which needs a blockchain to function, that Ethereum is a blockchain that needs a currency to function. This is. I think it's very true. And so back I thought, okay, Ethereum will not be used as a currency, but it might be used as a currency for IoT devices. So instead of the Internet of things, building the economy of things, and this is kind of what, what drove us. And then we wanted to build this universal sharing network as an application that at the time, Uber and Airbnb just became big. We thought, well, all those sharing economy services should run on chain. So let's build this called the universal sharing network. And then we thought about how to start with something tangible. And then we had the store lock. Actually, it's here in the background. If you see it, it's there. I have this DEFCON 1 physical smart lock which we connected to the Ethereum blockchain using our own software and had this idea of people pay to open the lock. And that's what we presented at DEFCON 1 together with this idea, which actually only came up like three or four days earlier, to connect this with a DAO and the rest, you know, history, what happened after that. But we didn't intend and we didn't start slok it for building a DAO. We wanted to build universal share network. Then we thought, well, this is way too big for us. We want to now focus on this Airbnb use case for door locks. And then we thought about fundraising. We talked to a bunch of VCs. I actually, I remember flying to New York, talking to VCs there. Everybody said no. Then I met Joseph Lubin. He said yes, maybe under some conditions. We just did not agree on the terms in detail at that. But I was presented at the Bitcoin meetup in New York and they all like the first application was a bitcoin application about arbitrage trading. It was like kind of boring. And then I came as a door lock was like super fascinating. Could open the door by paying some Ether. So it went well but we had, didn't have any money. So we thought about doing something like an ICO. But this was now after the launch of Ethereum. So if I. I started coding an ICO like smart contract. Why, why should we have have the money directly? It could stay in the contract and then people could vote for giving us part of it. Then we said well we could make proposals to it and then they can vote if the proposal proposal is good or not good or not, then the money would be released to us. Then they think why could not everybody make a proposal? Like everybody could procreate it. Everybody can make a proposal and those completely open. And we are just one of many service providers to the DAO building this universal shared network. And this was the origin of the DAO. Only like again, three days before Defcon 1, we actually decided we would go for it and put it into the presentation.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah amazing. I mean so on the timeline again trying to judge it. So Stefan was I guess chief communications officer or commute until September of 2015. That's when. When he left. Had you, had you left already by then? Can you remember?

SPEAKER_02:
No, I didn't really leave because I was technically a freelancer, although I was working full time for it. I didn't have like a formal employment contract. So I was. Continued to work I think until end of the year. And then I just talked. Well, did you just put down my hours? Basically if you need me, tell me. I just invoice what I'm doing and. But I was really leaving actually in December, January I think the last invoice was for December. And when Stefan Tua left or was being left, I mean there's another conversation how he left the foundation is. It was not. He didn't agree with some people getting Ethereum is another story for another day, I guess. And. But he was really a crucial part in building up this Ethereum community. He like all this meetup culture. The meetup culture didn't really exist like that before he was going from Place to place, finding someone running meetups. So he was very important for that. And I, I know I was a coder, I press assignment who I co founded Slack was also a coder. We needed someone who can talk to the people can do marketing and this stuff and we said well he has the right address book, he knows the right people, everybody knows him in the community. I think let's ask him if he wants to join us. And he did. And I think he was a very important part of making the DAO what it was later on he did some messages which I also didn't like and so he a bit in this craze what happened then. And I think the community was very, very hard with him because he was not always reacting maybe as he should in some situations after the hack but nevertheless he played a very important part in the history of Ethereum and also.

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I mean it was interesting. You.

SPEAKER_02:
You're saying that you're muted, Bob, I cannot hear you. Is it. Maybe it's just me?

SPEAKER_00:
Can you hear me?

SPEAKER_01:
I can still.

SPEAKER_03:
I. I hear him.

SPEAKER_02:
Sorry, I have an issue here. This was me system. So now I'm back.

SPEAKER_00:
Can. Can you hear us again now, Christoph?

SPEAKER_02:
Yes, I can hear you. I hope you can hear me too.

SPEAKER_00:
Okay, so the demo that you did at defcon one, again, another iconic event because yeah, you have that physical smart lock just sitting there on your shelf and you know, it rotated right, you know, right, you did your transaction.

SPEAKER_02:
We just had a Raspberry PI connected via, I think it was Sigbee or Set Wave back then to the door lock. And on the Raspberry PI we had actually an Ethereum client running and we had a smart contract on chain where you could send some money to it or Ether, actually, when it received some Ether, it would open up. This was basically the demo. But it was cool to see something physical. Some of them using Ethereum for, as I said before, the economy of things connected to IoT devices. Since most of the people in the room are still nerds and devs, they. They love that kind of stuff.

SPEAKER_00:
And there was also the kettle, wasn't there? The.

SPEAKER_02:
Yes, there was also a kettle where we just turned a smart plug, like a power plug. We could also turn on off. Same protocol, same thing. So we just want to show it's not just the door lock company, because actually you're not producing those. They're just connecting existing door locks to it. Wanted to show this idea of the universal sharing network. Everything which you can turn on, off or lock up and unlock could be now connected to this network. And everybody could put almost everything in there. Like a washing machine. You pay for using the washing machine or a bicycle lock. We even had padlocks connected to it so you could have it like your locker room and you have a padlock in front of it and sell whatever's in there by having someone pay to open the padlock. This was the generic idea. I mean, we got some VC money later after the, like in 2017, we built it. Nobody used it. It was like, not just too early. It was not. It was like everything for everyone, all at once. And of course, nothing for no one. It felt like the app was not great. So we failed B2C wise at Slockhead. We then turned into more consulting projects to build Incube, which was an IoT client. Made some money with that at about 50 people actually deployed employed at the time. In 2019, when we sold the company to Blockchains Inc. Jeffrey Burns, another. Another story.

SPEAKER_00:
So I remember speaking to Stefan at the time. So Stefan was involved with that demo. Right? Right. It was Stefan who came up on stage to make his little cup of tea with the, with the, with the kettle there. But I remember speaking to him that he'd been concerned about what the reception for him would be like, you know, having had this, you know, passing of ways with. With the foundation just two months before. But he was saying it was all very. It was all very friendly and people, you know, very excited about the project.

SPEAKER_02:
Right.

SPEAKER_00:
And saying actually about that IoT and pieces. So in January 2015, you had a demo that happened at the Consumer Electronics show, the CES in Vegas, which was a collaboration between IBM and Samsung. So the aforementioned Henning Diedrich part of that. And that Again was months before mainnet. But you had a proto web 3 stack there, which was I think POC 5 of Ethereum. You didn't have Whisper, you had another thing called Telehash and you didn't have. You had BitTorrent. So there was this Proto Web 3 stack there and they had demos like a washing machine buying its own detergent and scheduling its own repair. So. So yeah, that, that was happening a little earlier and, and yes, I mean, so Slock it itself did a number of these different products. Right. There was something with electrical charging and something to do with toll roads. Is that right?

SPEAKER_02:
Right. We had a prototype running with RWE or Inuchi in Germany. They're doing like all the, at the time, most of the charging stations. So this was in general like we got a lot of attention of course also after the DAO hack and all of that. And so that's kind of why we became a consulting company because so many asked us could we do a prototype issue because there were not many Ethereum builders at the time. So we have been building on Ethereum now since one year or two years, which you could not find anybody doing this. So we are building lots of nice prototypes and some almost production stuff and always related to IoT devices connected to the blockchain. This was a core business. And on top of this you built those prototypes. We did a lot of work for the Energy Web Foundation. I don't know if you're familiar with them, this was in Switzerland. They are kind of a fork of Ethereum, focusing on all the energy use cases. He built most of their stuff in 2018, beginning of 19, until they hired their own developers. Gavin was also part of this a while. So yes, this was still. I mean if you remember this time, Kim, you say there was so much enterprise, interest, enterprise at a time. We're just learning, looking into this, wants to build prototypes, not yet production stuff. Um, so. And there was a huge demand for, for blockchain experts, for doing consulting, for going to conferences. Explain them what a blockchain is with. At every tech conference you needed some blockchain talk. And this was kept basically mostly us and they paid sometimes like €4,000 for a talk. Like as a company you said, well, we need the money, let's go there. So we, of course you also have to think about us as persons, as diamonds and me. We didn't get any, any money for almost a year. Like we worked for. We were not rich people, we come from ordinary families and we said, well, we can work for like three to four months without a salary. Let's like build the Dao and then we becomes big. The Dao is paying Slocker to build it. Of course. After the hack it was clear there will never ever be a payment. So we can. We made zero money out of the Dao, so we needed to stop doing, start doing some work. And this was in the beginning. Let's do consulting for those large companies. This is how Slit Bec began to survive. Many people said you can like bury Slocket after what happened, like your name is burned forever. And we decided to. To stay as a team. I mean as a founder team. We own our mistakes. Maybe we are open and transparent about it as much as we could. It was of course an honest mistake. I mean you can talk for. It could be another session just for the da. I mean the DA is a lot of topics I just put here very shortly. Just, just talking about it from a company perspective. And then Stefan, to all he was saying, well, he was trying to get VC money. Simon and I, we were doing those consulting gigs. And Once we had VC money, what happened as a company was we got 2 million euros and of dollars and then we built the product, hired people for that, got more and more consulting gigs. So we always said, well, let's do them and just hire more people. And the end we had like 50 people, five or 10 doing the product and 40 people doing consulting. And then we got bought by Jeff Burns from Blockchains Inc. Remember, maybe at DEFCON 3, I think where he did this big tour in Prague, right. Want to build a city? I think I love the vision. He obviously had money. He wanted to build it on top of Ethereum Mainnet. I'll think about how maybe I can channel those billions into the right direction. Building is all as intended on Ethereum Mainnet, which was working fine for the beginning. And then I found out once you're an entrepreneur, you never can be an employee again. So I had to leave. So. But it's maybe actually it's too far in the future. I mean, that's one thing I think I have to say here because you talked about DEFCON 1 and you skipped a little bit DEFCON 2. You said in DEFCON 1, Stefan trial was very concerned how people perceive him and they were very gentle, forgiving and nice to him. So he was well received and then he built the Dao community. I was super worried to go to DEFCON 2 because this was after the downhill. I was like seriously thinking someone, they might beat me up there like around the corner. There are some people like, I kind of almost destroyed Ethereum with the spark and so much attention to it and all the money lost for some people or like the time of crows gone. It depends on how you feel it. So. But when I went to DEFCON too, people were so nice for giving. Basically hugging me when I was giving the talk there. And the only thing I didn't like was the foundation telling me I was not allowed to speak about the dao, which was like, what? Like I'm speaking here to the Ethereum community. Well, how can I not speak about the dao? And so I talked about a pretty boring talk about security. And I think every second talk was about security at Defcon 2. It was just about how we get those smart contracts secure. So I gave a rather boring talk, but in the end I just said, well, thank you for your understanding. And it was hard time and so on. And they were like somewhat. They've been standing ovations. I remember becoming emotional because this was. I did not expect this. I really expected like, guy, you messed up Ethereum. Like we almost lost it all. So I think this just speaks to the Ethereum community, how they treated Stefan, how they treated me. Even though mistakes were made, honest mistakes, at least from what I can tell. This is such a great community of really nice people who really want to change the world. Capable and also now financially capable of really doing things.

SPEAKER_00:
I was watching that video quite recently actually and. And yeah, it was quite cut off a little bit. You know, it was quite a long ovation there and. And yeah, you could certainly see that emotion in you. And that's when we first met actually was in Shanghai for DEFCON 2. I remember was. Was on the sidelines there in that main, main conference hall and yeah, it was lovely to see that, that's for sure. Okay.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah, I think good notes, just. Bob, you were the one who tried to impose half hour to hour rule. We're at a solid 120 right here.

SPEAKER_00:
Me the other time, maybe we, you know, we've reached a, you know, a good kind of end point, I guess. So what, what happened after Blockchain's LLC for you then?

SPEAKER_02:
So because of time, I keep it short. So yes, we got bought by Jeffrey Burns Blockchain LLC at the time again, the reason for this being he want to build a new city in the desert. He want to do all on IoT, all on Ethereum from scratch. And as a developer, dream building from scratch on a green field on top of Ethereum with our tech and I felt comfortable in the beginning. In the end I felt like we need to release stuff and there were some voices at the company which didn't want to release until like a very, very big product was done. For many reasons that didn't happen. I don't want to get into like that too much. So after two years I left Blockchains. Back then it was called Inc. They made a change in their name and I did for six months. I did really nothing. I forced myself to do nothing, which was great after so much stressful years. And then I started a venture studio called Kopos Ventures where we tried out many different ideas. We had EM3 which was a decentized messaging protocol. Gas hog. You can save transaction costs on Ethereum. What else did we have? So we have some domain name stuff but we didn't release it at the end. But the biggest one was Tokenize it and this was me being you built something for German. For now, German startups in the end we want to do it all over Europe and we just tokenizing their shares and do fundraising. So in summary it's like a web three based angel list for Europe. It's the one sentence description for Americans also to understand, you know angel list, it's a great tool for business angel investing. You want to do the same for Europe, for all countries there and build it on on chain. So tokenizing all those shares and enable private as well as public fundraising. So some called legal ICOs if you want but also for private fundraising. Our customers currently we have more than maybe a good, good way to end end this. We have now more than 400 investments from more than 320 business angels and more than 50 companies. Those are traditional German Gmbhs raising from super current conservative business angels and doing it completely on chain. They're paying in stable coins getting their tokenized shares. India non custodial wallet, they're all getting a NOA safe wallet from us using preview for login. So we build it as intended and we get normal people to use it. For me this is kind of a dream come true because I'm out of I love the Web3 bubble. I love this community, I love to work inside there. But for me Tokenize is a way to make this technology available where it belongs like to startups and investors outside of our Web3 bubble. And I'm super, super happy that I could keep up those values that they have complete platform is non custodial. They have their safe on Ethereum, holding their tokens, paying stable coins. So I'm very happy to see this over the next years, you want to basically roll out this all over Europe and become. Yes, the Web three based angelist for Europe. That's the goal.

SPEAKER_00:
Fantastic. Hope to see you@Defcon8.

SPEAKER_02:
Me too. I'm looking forward to it and as of now, and I don't intend any change, stick to Ethereum. I love the community I continue building and try to get a lot of people using it.

SPEAKER_00:
Have you been to every devcon?

SPEAKER_02:
Yes, I said yes, I've been to every defcon. The last one was actually the first song that I didn't give a talk and also went to every ECC except of one where there was Covid. There was a reason they couldn't come, but yes, I'm actually, I intend to continue to come to every defcon. It's like you meet the people like Thrift Queen, Left Terrace, of course, Vitalik and many others. It's just a sweet spirit there. Nice community. Love seeing how it all grows. Listen to those exciting talks. I mean, it's for tokenizers. It's not as relevant. It's not like our customers or it's a tech. Of course. We're just doing an ERC. 20 tokens on Ethereum. It's super easy. No deep tech. Sometimes I miss doing deep tech, but, well, I just enjoy being there, seeing what it all. What all happened and remembering those magic days. And just like only once in a lifetime or two times in a lifetime, you have this. This moment where everything comes together. The right time, the right place, the right people. This certainly where those like one and a half years I worked for Ethereum, but definitely like the prime of my career in terms of who I work with, what we accomplished, the impact we had on the world and this sweet cyberpunk spirit there and what we did there. It was really great. I always sometimes get emotional thinking about this and meeting those people again at defcon.

SPEAKER_00:
Fantastic. Well, thank you for all your contributions to that success.

SPEAKER_02:
Likewise.

SPEAKER_00:
All the best. Okay. Oh, just one more. Where can we find you?

SPEAKER_02:
You can find me usually on Twitter for the Ethereum people. Chr Yench, of course. I have a complicated name. Not many vocals in there, but you find it. Or of course on LinkedIn. Actually from my company. I'm more active on LinkedIn, which I was never before, but that's what we get our clients. Let's tokenize it. Yeah, but usually you can find me on Twitter. Follow me there on LinkedIn.

SPEAKER_00:
Excellent. Okay, thanks so much. Have a great day.

SPEAKER_01:
Thank you.

SPEAKER_02:
You too. That's great. Talking to you by.
