**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay, recording is in.
[00:02] Pro is in progress.
[00:04] It says so.
[00:06] Hello everybody.
[00:08] Today.
[00:10] Delighted to have Christoph Jens with us.
[00:12] We did attempt to record this, Christoph and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button.
[00:16] So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded.
[00:20] So this is round two.
[00:22] Hello Christoph, how are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:25] Hi everyone.
[00:27] Nice to meet you again.
[00:29] I'm doing good.
[00:31] I hope.
[00:33] You too.
[00:35] Thanks for the invitation.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:38] Fantastic.
[00:40] Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C Ethereum on my smartwatch.
[00:45] And this was around the time that Christoph was.
[00:48] Was still at the Ethereum Foundation.
[00:50] And then I think our cross paths have crossed a number of times since and.
[00:54] And Kieran's too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:57] Indeed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:00] So.
[01:02] So Christoph, what.
[01:04] What were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:07] So in the journey started in 2013.
[01:10] I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics actually about self-organizing systems.
[01:15] So like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things.
[01:20] So I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior and I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency.
[01:27] And.
[01:29] But the, the reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs like graphic cards and the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs.
[01:40] And so that's how I got into what's bitcoin mining.
[01:44] And so I bought my first bitcoin, got into this bubble, did read everything I could about it and then I came across the white paper From Vitalik, early 2014, something like January, February in some Bitcoin forum somewhere.
[01:57] And I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decent currency and all the characteristics and features of it.
[02:04] And this white paper of Vitalik's, and if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy, except of NFTs.
[02:11] Everything is in there from DAOs, from ENS, like names, domain name systems and all of that.
[02:18] So for me it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but just not a currency but everything else.
[02:26] And so then I started reading everything about it.
[02:30] And in 2014, actually still 2014, in summer, I read the crowd sale was in 2014.
[02:37] Right, right, yeah, the crowd sale.
[02:40] So around the time the crowd sale happened, I read did watch a video from Gavin Woods.
[02:46] He was somewhere in the Scandinavics some conference there.
[02:50] The Nordics and he talked about Ethereum.
[02:53] I loved it.
[02:55] And he said, you want to open up an office in Berlin looking for C++ developers.
[02:59] I was a C++ developer so in theoretical physics it's 90% software development.
[03:04] So I said well I want to do this.
[03:06] So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation time from and passed my PhD for like three or six months and said I will return after I'm done.
[03:16] I thought this is just a short project because they raised money maybe six, maybe maybe 12 months, 18 months or so, then it's over.
[03:25] When I started I thought about maybe three to six months and then I go back to my PhD.
[03:31] So I work there with Ethereum is Kevin Wood was a great time and then just decided to stay.
[03:37] Was so exciting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:40] So.
[03:42] So you never got to be a doctor?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:45] No, I'm not a doctor.
[03:47] I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left which was kind of a pity.
[03:52] I worked like for three years on that and.
[03:55] But I also had at the time, I think four or five kids.
[04:00] I needed some money.
[04:02] I didn't get much money as a PhD student so I did software development as a side hustle basically.
[04:08] And so when I got this project I said well let's do this for two or three months as a parental leave time and then I can return.
[04:16] And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD is that I will maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation will eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits, they just raised donations, then they will spend them and then it's over.
[04:31] Then I can continue my PhD.
[04:34] That was originally a plan, just came different.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:37] I mean I guess it's never too late, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:40] I actually sometimes think about if I should return.
[04:43] It's just so much to learn again I'm right now doing tokenize it.
[04:48] I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies.
[04:52] It works, works very well.
[04:55] So currently I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:58] No, because I mean famously you had, you know, Dr.
[05:01] Gavin Wood and Dr.
[05:03] Christian Wrightweisner as well and I think, I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:07] There was definitely.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:10] I also dropped out of mine.
[05:12] I was actually in mathematical physics too.
[05:16] Interesting similar background.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:19] It's actually the same like theoretical physics.
[05:22] It's the mathematical part of physics.
[05:25] I enjoyed it very much.
[05:27] I did thermodynamics and statistics mostly.
[05:31] Software development was really fun.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:34] Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join.
[05:37] I don't know there's anything that needs happening he gets some browser.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:41] Yeah, yeah, well he'll pop up and we can add him or if he's.
[05:45] Then never mind.
[05:47] So Christoph in terms of getting hired into fdev and I'm sorry if I just missed it.
[05:51] So how, how did that happen?
[05:54] Did you meet Gav at a meetup?
[05:57] Did you say?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:00] Yes, I actually, I listen only to his talk as for the online thing and I actually just wrote him an email, said look, I see this last developer would love to join Ethereum, love what you're doing.
[06:10] And he invited me to meet me in Kreuzberg Berlin, so which again is about two hours drive from here.
[06:16] So I went up there, met him.
[06:19] I remember the first conversation he was talking about all the stuff they were going to build and said well what, what can you do?
[06:24] And I just asked him what's like the most complicated stuff you have right now, like give me a complicated task, I somehow can figure it out.
[06:31] So he talked about the Ethereum rich machine which needed some testing.
[06:36] Jim.
[06:38] So, so I just picked working on testing the Ethereum virtual machine or like writing tests for it.
[06:44] Back at the time I actually had no real idea what he was talking about.
[06:49] Meaning of course I did understand on the white paper level I didn't understand what Ethereum was about.
[06:55] But Gavin had this skill of writing the yellow paper which is still incredible work.
[07:00] Like it's a such a great specification, different from Bitcoin really having a specification so multiple clients could be built.
[07:07] And in there he defined the Ethereum virtual machine.
[07:11] And I, I think I read the paper six, seven times.
[07:15] I felt like I was one out of don't know, 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood the yellow paper.
[07:22] I did corrections to it.
[07:24] I have some pull requests actually in the yellow paper GitHub repo added missing definitions and stuff like that.
[07:31] And then what I mostly did was writing tests according to the specification which then were with the help of the C client because this was his team.
[07:40] I was working also on the C code base and so gas PI, Ethereum, also the JavaScript version and what else do we have like five Haskell client and others.
[07:50] They're basically using my test to see if they are implemented Ethereum virtual machine also the state translations and block creation correctly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:55] Yeah, yeah.
[07:57] So I mean just just to have some timeline for the, for the viewers.
[08:01] So Vitalik wrote the white paper in November 2013.
[08:05] Various other people sort of joined in on the efforts in December, including Gav and Jeff who started the C and Go clients Respectively at the very end.
[08:14] Oh my goodness, At the very end of December kind of Christmas projects for them both.
[08:20] January 2014 you had sort of like the, the public announcement of Ethereum at the, at the Bitcoin Miami conference.
[08:27] It was as early as April 2014 that Gav wrote the yellow paper which is, you know, as you were saying, the sort of formal specification.
[08:35] You had the crowd sale between July and September 2014.
[08:40] So then yeah, you, you were coming in right after that, you know, so you had a wave of arrivals in September and October of that year.
[08:47] Essentially because the crowd sale had happened.
[08:50] There was some money to actually hire people and then talking about, you know, where you.
[08:54] Where you met there initially that group.
[08:57] So FDEV were and is a company coordinating the development of of Ethereum stuff.
[09:02] So it's a subsidiary of the Ethereum Foundation.
[09:05] They were working initially in a co-working space but then.
[09:09] And it was between August and November of that year that the Office was getting like, you know, done up and tidied.
[09:16] And then in November you had DEVCON 0, you know, the first conference, you know, an internal one where a lot of the people that was their first sort of face to face meeting.
[09:26] How was devcon zero?
[09:29] How was that?
[09:31] What was that like?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:34] It was like a company retreat.
[09:36] So this was not a public conference.
[09:39] We did have even though there were some outsiders who felt like part of the community maybe also pushed some code.
[09:45] And I remember the.
[09:47] I was in his name again wrote the book also about Ethereum.
[09:51] Did Lexus from IBM.
[09:54] Yeah, I think he was also there just as an example of some people who are like reading about Ethereum.
[09:59] Interested in joining.
[10:01] But it was mostly developers.
[10:04] But also I think Stefan to all was already there.
[10:08] So we had already the London team.
[10:11] So it was like an internal Ethereum meeting.
[10:14] Kind of a meetup.
[10:16] Almost.
[10:18] I think three days or so.
[10:20] I don't know exactly five days even.
[10:23] So it was a full week.
[10:25] I was there for the full week as far as I can remember.
[10:29] I did a presentation about testing how the test suite is very important.
[10:34] Yes, we had to remix projects.
[10:37] Solidity Project I think mostly started during the time Gavin used this for a explaining his vision of what Ethereum as a platform for decentralized applications.
[10:46] So building Swarm.
[10:49] I don't know if Swarm and Risper was already launched there but at least like the generic idea, the MIS browser.
[10:56] So all those ideas are really sketched out there like the technical roadmap.
[11:01] What we are going to build because we started just of course with the basic clients like implementing the protocol.
[11:07] But he took it like kind of what are we going to do in the next 12 months building the Mist browser, like remix of those tools to have a platform for decentralized applications.
[11:16] I remember one slide which I think I posted on Twitter a while ago, but you have those three circles, one circle is one node and you would see like they are connecting on the blockchain using Swarm for the data, whisper for the messages.
[11:27] And you like this whole picture was painted there and the people attending, I think around 50 people plus minus 10, don't know exact number where mostly developers talking about code coding there.
[11:37] Joseph, I remember him being there saying well all of you, you will create your own companies becoming millionaires.
[11:42] I remember CH was talking about that and I think mostly was he was right.
[11:46] So most of those people in the room in one way or another co-founded, founded or early part of companies building on top of Ethereum in the years to come.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:51] Yeah, yeah.
[11:53] Let me see if I can do a little, a little screen share.
[11:57] No, never mind.
[12:00] I can't work out how not.
[12:03] Not to worry.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[12:06] But, but yeah, this is present button.
[12:09] So not working.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:12] Yeah, I don't see that.
[12:15] Is that on the right hand side.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[12:18] Somewhere or at the bottom you maybe have a different.
[12:22] For me, I appear on the top right and below and to the right of me below there's a present button.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:27] Right.
[12:29] With like a plus post maybe.
[12:32] Never mind, never mind.
[12:35] I was just going to show the iconic photo of people at DEVCON 0.
[12:40] Right.
[12:42] You know that's this big group shot with nearly everyone who was out there, you know.
[12:47] So that's a classic Ethereum photo.
[12:50] So I was looking, Sorry, there's like 11 of the videos are still around from Devcon Zero.
[12:56] I think there were about 20 sessions.
[13:00] I'm still trying to dig out the others.
[13:03] Some of them, including yours, I have not managed to find yet.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:06] Yeah, it was only about the test suite, how it build it, how people would use it.
[13:11] It was rather technical.
[13:14] There was not much of a vision in there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:17] Well, left terrorist presented on Emacs so you're not the most boring talk.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:21] Again.
[13:23] It was just the nerds starting also for most of them.
[13:27] The first time we actually met, of course the C team, they didn't know each other because they're working in the co-working space Left Terrace and others were there.
[13:35] But then let's say I think it was the first time I actually met Vitalik because he came there then of Course Jeffrey and his team, Stefan's team, Joseph Lubin.
[13:44] So it was for me it was the first time to meet all of them and having talks and since we really had time, five days, a small group of people, we actually do have time to eat together to talk.
[13:54] So it was not so crowded maybe as defcon is today.
[13:58] Very intimate.
[14:00] Was good.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:03] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[14:05] I mean one thing I can't quite remember.
[14:08] So there was a time there was an Ethereum slack that was kind of open to the public.
[14:13] There were a lot of people.
[14:16] The sort of Ethereum affiliation status was fairly vague at that point.
[14:21] And we were, you know I, I remember we were using Skype a lot in those days.
[14:26] Just, just the team and like Vitalik like to Skype.
[14:30] And then at some point I sort of lost the thread of like where the core like I can't remember where the core development discussions were happening.
[14:37] And I'll maybe I'll ask Jim to comment also.
[14:41] Just like those tests we kept like getting them and I think I'm thinking of some a little bit earlier on and we'd build them and Jim was mostly working on them and would update on the like passing percentage which would always be between like 93 and 98 and then something would change, you know.
[14:53] But yet like where did the discussion?
[14:56] Because yeah between like sale and devcon0 I think it kind of got a little bit.
[14:59] It like moved around where the dev discussion.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:02] Yeah, it was mostly Skype.
[15:05] We also had Skype channels for almost everything like the C team and so on.
[15:10] Then I in a short time they used a.
[15:13] It was a note taker which had a name also with E something.
[15:17] Yeah.
[15:19] Ether Pad, something like this.
[15:22] Right.
[15:24] There were some notes being written there but the communication was really I would say 99% Skype for me.
[15:30] Later on we used a tool based on GitHub.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:34] What was the name of was called Gator.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:37] Gitter came later.
[15:40] This was like the replacement for Skype.
[15:43] But I didn't use it too much.
[15:46] This was actually during the time and I was actually leaving but it was done used also by C.
[15:51] There you had a channel per GitHub repo.
[15:55] This was during the time that GitHub was completely reorganized because at the beginning was like one big repo is everything they made sub-modules was so messy.
[16:04] And during those, during this process we got Gitter.
[16:08] But yeah for me it was mostly Skype.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:11] Yeah.
[16:13] And.
[16:15] And then annoyingly that kind of means a lot of these early discussions are kind of like a bit lost because nobody is is using Skype.
[16:22] And Skype is getting like deleted.
[16:25] This is happening in February of next year.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:28] Oh, I thought it happened already.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:31] It's no, you can still request to download.
[16:34] And I did and then I haven't heard anything back and want to do that to see if I can get some of those.
[16:40] So everybody apply to download your.
[16:43] Your Skype data.
[16:45] I remember the with, with Gitter there was a discussion about this that I was involved with at the EF later which was saying the problem with Skype is it wasn't discoverable.
[16:54] You know, you had to add, you had to request to be added, but you had to know what was there to be able to do that request.
[17:01] So it was a bit of a chicken and egg situation.
[17:04] Whereas Gitter, it was like a one to one with the repositories.
[17:08] So if you're using a repo.
[17:11] There you go.
[17:13] There's a one to one channel with that.
[17:16] And it was discoverable and archived.
[17:20] But then Slack I think was even earlier.
[17:23] So.
[17:25] Oh, there was the forum as well.
[17:28] Right?
[17:30] It was an Ethereum forum too.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:33] Yeah, it was important.
[17:35] And then Slack.
[17:38] I think I got introduced to Slack by Stefan Tual when he created a community for the DAO.
[17:43] When he looked for a new communication tool, he went with Slack.
[17:47] And at that time it was not like today like a business tool for the company.
[17:52] It was really communities.
[17:55] Like we had 5,000 people in our Slack, which is not how it's used today.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:59] Yeah, yeah.
[18:01] So welcome Jim.
[18:04] Your technical problem.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[18:07] Hi.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:10] Sorry.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[18:12] I had some technical problems for a while there, but I don't know, I'm just listening to you guys.
[18:17] What, what, what happened that brought the whole world to Zoom?
[18:22] Suddenly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:25] It was in waves look for on my side.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[18:29] I don't know, I just, I just woke up one day and everything was Zoomed.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:34] Yeah.
[18:36] From then on species like a statistical phase transition, you know.
[18:41] I think it was.
[18:43] It was two faces.
[18:46] I would always get invited to corporate like let's say 2017 to 2019 when I was doing primarily BD, I found that I would get invited to any of 10 video conferencing tools.
[18:58] And like what is the Cisco one was the Webex.
[19:02] That was horrible.
[19:05] I would get that a lot.
[19:08] Google meetings didn't feel sufficiently corporate or something even though it was okay.
[19:14] And Zoom had the best quality for a while.
[19:18] And I found that everyone picked Zoom at the same time.
[19:22] Like mid 2018, let's say.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:25] I think it was just quality to me.
[19:28] Like I mean Microsoft really fumbled.
[19:32] Right.
[19:34] Skype had got such a lead for so Long.
[19:38] But Zoom just seemed more reliable.
[19:42] Whatever weird little proprietary magic they had going on.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:46] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[19:48] And then I guess, yeah, I guess I was under the impression that like Zoom is for businesses.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[19:53] I think that's.
[19:56] Well that is true, but it was just that still, I mean this, this has gotten way better in the last 10 years, but still nothing really works for reliable video over the.
[20:05] The Internet.
[20:08] It's, it's just much better than, than what existed.
[20:12] But there was a free version always and they would just like time you out.
[20:17] So like they had a fairly viral acquisition loop where like.
[20:22] And I was just gonna say in the pandemic once when people were locked down, it became a consumer tool where people would have like yard, large yoga classes or you know, sermons or whatever with like 500 people on a Zoom and then everyone bald.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[20:36] Yeah, I remember it well.
[20:39] All of a sudden like my, my parents were like calling me up and they're like, we found this awesome new tool.
[20:45] You probably never heard of it, it's called Zoom.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[20:49] But yeah, there were like 10.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:52] Let's move on from sharing about video platforms, eh?
[20:56] So, so I look back, so, so Jim's first commits on.
[21:01] On the Haskell client were mid September 2020 14.
[21:06] So you know, a couple of months ahead of, ahead of devcon zero that you'd had the yellow paper for.
[21:13] For, for.
[21:15] For.
[21:17] For.
