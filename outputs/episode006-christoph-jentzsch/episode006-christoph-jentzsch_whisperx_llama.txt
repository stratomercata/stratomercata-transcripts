SPEAKER_02: Okay, recording is in progress. Hello, everybody. Um, today, delighted to have Christoph with us. We did attempt to record this two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So, we spoke for an hour or so, and then it was not recorded. This is round two. So, hello, Christoph, how are you?

SPEAKER_00: Hi, Rob. Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope you too. Thanks for the invitation.

SPEAKER_02: Fantastic. Yeah, so Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch. This was around the time Christoph was still at the Ethereum Foundation. Then, I think I crossed paths with him across a number of times since, and Kieran's too, indeed. So, Christoph, what were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

SPEAKER_00: So, the journey started in 2013. I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics, actually about self-organizing systems. So, like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things. So, I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior. And I came across Bitcoin, which is just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency. But the reason I came across it was I was looking for cheap GPUs, like graphic cards. And the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs. And so, that's how I got into what's Bitcoin mining. And so, I bought my first Bitcoin, got into this bubble, did read everything I could about it, and then I came across the white paper from Vitalik early 2014, something like January or February, on some Bitcoin forum somewhere. And I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decentralized currency and all the characteristics and features of it. And this white paper, if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy. Except for NFTs, everything's in there, from DAOs, from ENS, like domain names, systems, and all of that. So, for me, it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but not just for the currency, but everything else. And so, then I started reading everything about it. And in 2014, in summer, I read that the crowdsale was in 2014, right? So, around the time the crowdsale happened, I watched a video from Gavin Wood. He was somewhere in Scandinavia, some conference there, um, the Nordics, and he talked about Ethereum. I loved it, and he said, "You want to open up an office in Berlin?" Looking for C++ developers, I was a C++ developer, so I said, "Well, I want to do this." So, I took my parental leave time, plus some vacation time, and passed my PhD for like three or six months, and said, "I will return after I'm done." I thought this was just a short project because they raised money, maybe six, maybe 12 months, 18 months or so, then it's over. When I started, I thought, maybe three to six months, and then I go back to my PhD. So, I worked there with Ethereum, with Gavin Wood, it was a great time, and then just decided to stay. It was so exciting.

SPEAKER_02: So, you never got to be a doctor? No, I'm not a doctor.

SPEAKER_00: I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left, which was kind of a pity. I worked for three years on that. But I also had, at the time, I think four or five kids. I needed some money. I didn't get much money as a PhD student. So, I did software development as a side hustle, basically. And so, when I got this project, I said, "Well, let's do this for two or three months as a parent leave time, and then I can return." And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD; that I will maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation would eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits. It just raised donations, and then it was spent. That's over. Then I can continue my PhD. That was originally the plan. Just came different.

SPEAKER_03: I mean, I guess it's never too late, right?

SPEAKER_00: I actually sometimes think about if I should return. It's just so much to learn again. I'm right now doing Tokenize.it. I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies. It works very well. And so, currently, I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

SPEAKER_02: No, because I mean, famously, you had Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian Reitweissner as well. And I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well.

SPEAKER_01: There was definitely. I also dropped out of mine. I was actually in mathematical physics too. Interesting. Similar background.

SPEAKER_00: It's actually the same. Like theoretical physics, it's the mathematical part of physics. I enjoyed it very much. I did thermodynamics and statistics, mostly software development. It was really fun.

SPEAKER_01: Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join. I don't know if there's anything that needs happening. He gets some browser issues.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Well, he'll pop up, and we can add him, or if he's, then never mind. So, so, so Christoph, in terms of, um, you know, getting hired into F Dev, and I'm sorry if I just missed it. So, how did that happen? Did you meet Gav at a meetup, or did you say, "Yes, I actually listened only to his talk. It was an online thing, and I actually just wrote him an email, said, 'Look, I would love to join Ethereum, love what you're doing,' and he invited me to meet me in Kreuzberg, Berlin." So, which again is about two hours' drive from here. So, I went up there, met him. I remember the first conversation; he was talking about all the stuff they were going to build, and said, "Well, what can you do?" And I just asked him, "What's like the most complicated stuff you have right now? That give me a complicated task. I somehow can figure it out." So, he talked about the Ethereum virtual machine, which did some testing. Hi, Jim. So, I just picked working on testing the Ethereum virtual machine or writing tests for it. Back at the time, I actually had no real idea what he was talking about, meaning, of course, I did understand on the white paper level, I did understand what Ethereum was about. But Gavin had this skill of writing the yellow paper, which is still incredible work. It's such a great specification, different from Bitcoin, really having a specification. So, multiple clients could be built. And in there, he defined the Ethereum virtual machine. And I think I read the paper six or seven times. I felt like I was one out of, I don't know, 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood the yellow paper. I did corrections to it. I have some pull requests actually in the yellow paper GitHub repo, added missing definitions and stuff like that. And then what I mostly did was writing tests according to the specification, which then were with the help of the C++ client, because this was his team. So, I was working also on the C++ code base. And so, Geth, PyEthereum, also the JavaScript version, and what else did we have? Like Haskell client and others. I'm basically using my tests to see if they are implemented in the image machine, also the state transitions and block creation correctly.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, just to have some timeline for the viewers. So, Jim's first commits on the Haskell client were mid-September 2014. So, you know, a couple of months ahead of DevCon 0, that you'd had the yellow paper for five months at that time. And I did find on our Slack, um, you know, a bit of a thread where, where things, I think from you, Christoph, were being discussed by Jim. I don't know; did you guys interact directly at all on testing, Jim, Christoph? Not directly, not as far as I can remember. I mean, maybe there was some messages; I mean, it's about it has been a while ago.

SPEAKER_04: I could be wrong. I may have met you briefly in London when we had that conference, but it would have been like, uh, like hi, you know, quick greetings at a party or something.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, 10 years ago, lots of people, sure. We were testing GitHub repo, and we had all the major clients using it. And I was interacting, mostly asking, responding questions. I mean, of course, the C++ team, I was super close to. I used the C++ team also to pre-fill the tests. So, this was... per default, right, except we found there was a test failing, but actually, C++ was wrong. So, sometimes this happened. The test was not really failing, just C++ was wrong. But in the maturity of cases, C++ was right. So, we were just having those conversations, and we found tons of issues. We did, not just in the beginning, I wrote those tests using actually bytecode, the very first test. Then I went to a low-level Lisp-like language. This was LLL. This was the... precursor to Solidity by Gavin. And then, in the end, actually, I had automated like fast testing where I wrote software that would create thousands of tests that we had some AWS, like over 100 cores of machines constantly creating tests. We had always some failing on some versions of Geth or other clients. So, this was mostly what I did during one and a half years.

SPEAKER_02: Right, right. So, yeah, I mean, I guess, for the viewers, something that Ethereum chose to do differently from Bitcoin was to have this specification separate from the client software, right? So, you know, when Bitcoin started, uh, it was the code that happened first, and the white paper afterwards, but the white paper wasn't a protocol specification. So, Gav was doing that yellow paper spec in parallel with the C++ client, which was sort of the first one, while you have Vitalik working on the Python client, Jeff working on the Go internally, but then you've got all these other clients as well, right? So, the Java one by Roman, I think, started in about April or May. You know, ourselves, Jim, and Kieran here with, uh, with a Haskell client starting in September, you had JavaScript as well.

SPEAKER_00: So, it's more like a library. I don't know if it's really like a syncing client, but they have all the tools, so you can, in your web app, kind of integrate part of, part of it to verify. So, states.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I think maybe they had a syncing client at some point, apart from it, obviously, like couldn't actually keep up, but theoretical, um, and, um,

SPEAKER_02: And, yeah, like a little later, there was a Ruby client as well. And, yeah, at one point, there were eight different clients.

SPEAKER_00: Right. If you want to, I can tell the story of why we all are using Geth today. Yeah, this is not absolutely not a given at the time. Of course, everyone had different opinions, but the C++ client was really the fastest, the most solid one, passing all the tests, and so on. But Gavin always wanted to add new features. We went to a refactoring, and he was a perfectionist, which is not bad for this kind of software. And then the time came for the security audit, because everybody wants to launch Ethereum now. And we said, before we launch it, those clients need to have a proper security audit by an external company. And one of the companies doing this was Deja Vu in Seattle. So, I actually went there with a team for the audit. And because Gavin wanted to build some more features, he said, "Well, let's just let Geth go first. Let's first audit the Go client." When they are done, I'm done with the features I wanted to build. And then we're going into the audit for the C++ client. So, Geth was audited. They had some issues. They fixed the issues. And now it's fine. And so, there was technically no reason why not. Well, actually, we could launch Ethereum now. We have a fully audited client. Testnet is running for a while. No major issues. No failing tests for a long time. So, why would we wait for the C++ client to be audited? I mean, they all really had the pressure of money running out. We need to launch now. And then a decision was made. Let's launch this Geth. They can still use C++. It's just not audited. Let's say, in two months or so, the audit is done, and then they can use C++ even more if they want. But then the big mistake was, in my view, when they made this announcement of, "You can start now," they recommended using Geth because it was the audited one. So, almost everybody won Geth. This was like, we started with almost 100% Geth, and then there was just a minor other clients using, only very few did use them. And so, after the audit was done, nobody switched, for sure, Geth is running, I'm synced, like what's the issue, why should I switch? And so, we had this 19, 10, or 18, 20 distribution, it just stayed like this. So, if Gavin would have been either, say, "Let's just do the audit now, and we just have both audited, and then start," maybe we would have 50-50. Or even the other way around, if they would have first audited in C++ and Ethereum would have been launched without a Geth audit, they would have received a total switch. And then, of course, money was going low in the foundation. They had to reduce the team. And because Geth was the most used one, there were some issues with Gavin, another story, maybe have a talk with him. And so, in the end, Ming decided to basically kick out the complete C++ team. This was then shortly before DevCon 1. So, something like November, October-ish. But, yeah, I think the reason for that was also C++ wasn't really that used. Also, there are other reasons as well. But you can see how a tiny thing can have such big consequences down the road, like him doing Polkadot today, and all of that. And he was great. I mean, I really, I still think, I think maybe we would have had a mistake, and sharding way earlier if Gavin would have stayed. So, without him, they moved slower. And, of course, the price went up. There were no security-relevant things. So, changes happened not quickly anymore, but take more time, and so on. But I think this was a big loss for Ethereum that Gavin left, basically, in 2015.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's amazing.

SPEAKER_01: The client side was the cause. I think it was part of it. The process maybe started with the Red Wedding, which we discussed in some other early days of Ethereum episodes. I remember very clearly in the room, it was like two weeks into my Ethereum tenure at that time, that he was talking about brain drain if it was only going to be a nonprofit foundation and not going to have a commercial arm.

SPEAKER_00: Yes, there were more issues than that, definitely. Like, this was not the deciding part, but it was like those things were adding up. I remember that Gavin had this idea of turning the foundation into a DAO and then having a for-profit entity next to it, which would build things and make money. So, there were many different commercial ideas at the time. So, he then basically started on his own, ETH Core. I remember he wanted to have me as part of it, but I decided to do Slockit at the time. So, that's why I didn't become a co-founder of ETH Core. Another story, we can go into this if you want. You know what happened after that. But there are many reasons we are part of it. I think also, him and Ming didn't really get along too much. There was not really a trust relationship going on. Of course, money running out, different visions of how Ethereum should evolve technically and economically, if you want. All played a role, but I think it was just one part that the C++ client wasn't really used that much. And the reason for that was Geth being audited, and we launching without an audit for the C++ client.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, talking about features, so many things happened, right? Gav had this period of incredible productivity between that December and that April of getting from nothing, just having the white paper, all the way through to having a working client, having the yellow paper. As you mentioned, you know, there's this diagram showing how Whisper and Ethereum and Swarm were intended to fit together, and I found some more timing on that. So, Swarm was envisaged by Daniel Nagy as far back as 2011. Know it was an idea he'd been working on for like three years before that. I spotted on the Whisper presentation that Gavin did that it was a pre-Ethereum idea as well. So, it was probably only when all of these people came together, it was like, "Well, you've got this storage idea, you've got this blockchain kind of like CPU databasey idea." And then, if you have messaging, all of these things can fit together. But it's always, it's also, we're going to build our own IDE as well. Browser. Browser, Ms. Browser. I'm sorry?

SPEAKER_00: The problem with this is you only need it if you really need it. Meaning, if Uniswap failed, the interface is not there. It's like a backup. But it's not what you want to use daily. And if you remember, let me give you a DevCon one. When they presented MetaMask, my first thought was, "Oh, this is totally away from the vision." How can you not run a full node? How dare you to just serve over RPC with Infura? Almost not a scam, but it was not what we intended to build. Today, it's like, this is a decentralized version of it. This is like non-custodial, the MetaMask; they're the good guys, compared to all the others. See how the view shifted over the years. Then, it was absolutely required to run a full node if they missed browser. This is how it's done. And now, we have MetaMask plus Infura. And today, this is really the version which is viewed as the original non-custodial Ethereum vision. How things are shifting, basically. But, yes, you only need those things if things are falling apart. Just as an example, so many people use the Gnosis Safe. Let's say the Gnosis Safe UI is gone. Technically, it shouldn't be a problem to run another one, but I really need something on IPFS. I need something which can self-host, so I can still access my wallet without going to the command line. So, for those reasons, you need it. And the Mist browser was sort of as the fallback for every debt. Like, of course, you can have your application run on a normal .com domain on AWS, fine. But if you could serve the same app in a decentralized fashion as a backup, this would be great, because you could still use it if the company gets a Uniswap, the company fails. If someone builds a nice Uniswap UI served by IPFS, directly interacting with the smart contracts.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's fair. Also, Uniswap, I think, is controversial. I know Jim wanted to say something. Controversial because they had the company-level fee skim, and then I think they've turned the on-chain fee on.

SPEAKER_02: Don't know that they've turned the company fee off. I haven't read that for detail. I believe so, because one of the replies was saying, "Okay, so how are your like shareholders gonna like that?" Yeah, okay, fair enough. Uh, well, hopefully, they hold a bunch of the UNI, and, uh, it will, uh, you know, mark tomorrow; they're doing a bunch of burn, so that you know, it should be to the benefit of all, uh, stakeholders. But, yeah, just sort of this interesting kind of contrast, right, between completely immutable force of nature, smart contracts, versus more permission, more tied to a company, more sort of like wanting to have fees for maintenance, kind of question.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, you know, it's like treasuries, I guess, either. But this opens up the questions of how should the Ethereum app be built economically, and this is also a question being answered during that time. This was being the DAO, one approach of it, should be fully on-chain, all the revenue should be on-chain, it should be no for-profit entity directly attached to it. And Slockit, the company I built after that, would be a service provider for them, getting paid by them for work being done for the DAO. But one version I was always skeptical, and still am, about companies, where you have effectively two cap tables, meaning you have a token cap table, if you want, of course, it's a utility token, governance token, and so on. But effectively, it's kind of ownership in the protocol. And then you have a for-profit company with shareholders. And this is always, I think, very dangerous, because you don't know where to go into. Where's the value? On the shares of the company, or on the token? This was the main reason all those companies had those nonprofit foundations in Switzerland. Rightfully so, because they said, "You only want to have one cap table, like the Ethereum Foundation." There was no shareholders of Ethereum. There was a nonprofit foundation, and a token. The token, if you want to have a share in the economic success of the protocol, you would buy Ether. And so, later on, there were many other token projects where they had a nonprofit foundation. So, no shareholders, no second cap table. And then you would have only the token, and all the value would be there. And now, with Uniswap, you have this problem of having again shareholders and tokens. And I think that's dangerous, and not a good idea, actually.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. Um, so, uh, perhaps let's, uh, talk about, uh, DevCon, actually, just before we get to DevCon one. So, the launch, right. So, obviously, a lot of, uh, testing and coordination, and this different series of, of proof of concepts. So, I mean, what, how did you know it was good enough? Like, what was that testing flow, and collaboration like?

SPEAKER_00: So, there are many indicators, one being the Olympic test that running smoothly for a while, other one where SSL declined, having an audit, which worked. And then they were saying, "Okay, now, if Christoph doesn't find any failing tests for like three weeks or four weeks or something, we are ready." And this was the case. And so, we said, "Now, we can set a launch date." In the launch itself, it's also a bit typically, typically, Gavin, or also Vitalik, nobody wanted to push a button, like nobody just likes to start the chain. So, what was done was, there was a script written, which has as an input parameter the hash of the Olympic testnet at a certain block height, so everybody could, using this script, plus the software, plus C++ or Go client, of course, having plus the hash, which was at that time in the future of the Olympic test, let's start that chain. So, there was no, at launch day, we were just viewing it. There was nothing to be done. It was like, everything was, all the information was out there. People were just simultaneously starting the blockchain. And then, over the peer-to-peer network, this was actually the more harder stuff. They found themselves on Reddit, and others, to share IP addresses, like connect to my peer, connect to my peer. And so, then they started to come together, and, of course, the longest chain was a valid one, so, as soon as you found a peer, which had their own chain, you would say, "Yes, this is a longer one," you would stop, and start mining on top of his chain. And so, basically, the canonical chain emerged from that, within, I don't know, 30 minutes, or one hour, and then we had the chain running, and this was a like a beauty to behold, like, to just see how this works out as intended, completely decentralized, nobody did that, do anything, it's just, I was in the Z+Plus+ Berlin office, in Kreuzberg, 37A, with a nice office, and we just watched it. And we were somewhere mining there with the laptop. And we were all excited, as it started. I actually think, two or three weeks after, or maybe four, we had the first little hard fork, meaning, there was some smart contract doing something, that gas, and C++ had a different result. It was, for me, almost the middle of the night, at 10 PM, or 11 PM. So, I remember seeing this, looking for one hour, or so, finding what's the issue. Then, I found it, wrote a test about it, Peter's bus was right, Geth was wrong. So, we gave it to Jeff, they fixed this, I think, we said, one hour, and, like, after five hours, everything was done. It's a basic call, that the miners, please update your client. Um, so, and then it was fine. So, this was the early days, but it was a successful launch.

SPEAKER_04: No, we were able to sync at Genesis time, for like a year or so, we were syncing. But I remember, like, that week, Karen, and I were like, more interested in trying to get a miner in place. So, that was what that week looked like for us.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was living in an apartment, just south of Berkeley campus, at this time, and Jim had taken me to Fry's to build a machine, a few months prior, like a build machine. It had a good GPU in it.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Fry's is dead now.

SPEAKER_01: RIP. So, I was running a miner there, and we built a couple, in Jim's garage. It got very hot, in Jim's garage, which was, you know, those things were consuming a fair bit of power. Mine exploded, after a few weeks. It was actually just the power supply. So, I thought the whole machine was bricked, and Jim said, "You know, I think everything, but the power supply, will be okay." And it was the case, that everything, but the power supply, was okay, but then I stopped mining.

SPEAKER_04: Um, and I think, Jim, we didn't even bother to buy cases, at that time.

SPEAKER_01: Right. Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: You may have had a case. I had mine just sitting, wires out.

SPEAKER_02: Um, but, yeah, I think, um, maybe, Bob, you would know, that, I think, this was someone else, wrote this big thing, this might have been Alex, yeah, it was Alex, did that. Um, saying, about, sort of, documentation, or whatever, there was a wiki, right, it was an Ethereum wiki, and a number of things were documented, only on the wiki, um, and I think, these, kind of, wire protocol pieces, were, were part of that. But, yeah, Alex Leverington, was the first hire, into that Berlin office. And he primarily, I mean, he worked on a few different C++ things. But the main thing, he's known for, is DevP2P, which was that common, underlying, P2P protocol. Though, you already had libP2P, which is the transport, for IPFS. That already existed, at the time. So, it was a bit of, not invented here, going on. Um, but, but, yeah, he, uh, he was there, for, for DevCon zero, as well, and he spoke, remember, Alex, I was not too much, into the peer-to-peer, side of the code base, I was more into the EVM, and Solidity, small contract side, they tell you, what, there was a bit of funny, crossover, with the later part, of, uh, yours, was Alex Leverington, uh, worked with John Gerrits, on a project, called Airlock.

SPEAKER_00: So, remember, that, I saw it later, like, after we did our presentation, and had the slug, and stuff going, they showed us, videos, of very earlier, than us, so, yes, they were actually, time-wise, they did this, before we did, but I did not know, about it, at all, and so, we did it, more or less, in parallel, then, and we just launched, a bit quicker, like, to go to the public, with the project, it has been, from their side, was more like, a little, diet project, it looked like, a big company, or intended to be.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember, this project, yeah, so, I think, that, was, at the hackathon, at the Bitcoin Expo, in, uh, April, uh, 2014, that, that, they, uh, did that, and Stefan, actually, did an interview, with them, you can see, that, on YouTube, you know, this is, like, talking, about early Ethereum projects, you know, and this is, like, over a year, before the main net, it's like, so far back, some of these. But, yeah, like, some of that spec stuff, was, it was not, in the yellow paper, and it was just, sort of, floating around, and a long time, before, there was, real consolidation, of that full client spec.

SPEAKER_03: But, you managed to do it, anyway, Jim. You managed to build the client.

SPEAKER_04: It was a busy week. But, it was just notable, to me, because, at least, from what I was seeing, it went from zero, to one, like overnight. I had never heard of it, the night before, and then, the next morning, it was like, in the clients, and working, and I couldn't connect, to anything.

SPEAKER_01: Which is normally, the pattern, but, yeah, just, this one, was like, the biggest, one-time change, that I can recall, either.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Again, this was pre-launch days. Things had to move fast. There was a lot of pressure, going around. It was messy. There was not much coordination, between the clients, except, for maybe, some scrap groups. And, in the end, yes, we tell you, Gavin, and Jeff, just made decisions, and executed, as quick, as they could. So, this all changed, after launch, then things became, a bit slowed down, and people consolidated, and every change, was a big thing, rightfully so, um, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so, back, on the timeline, so, it was July 2015, that Mainnet launched, with a frontier hard fork. And then, as you touched on, you had Ming, so Ming's first official day, was the 1st of August 2015, at which point, the foundation, had been running, for a year, or so, and was close to out of money. Touching on your thinking, it would only last, for a certain amount of time, a year on, that raise, which I think was around $16, or perhaps $18 million, was nearly all gone. So, you have these quite hard decisions, about what part of this grand vision, was going to be funded, initially, right, and I remember, talking to her, at the time, she felt, like, I have to clean up, the whole mess, like, the paperwork, and everything, was totally messy, working with lawyers, accountants, and so on, and getting clean up, basically, of the foundation, I mean, for me, I did expect, it to last, something like that, so, it was, for me, it was clear, they are not making, any money, I didn't know, how big, the reserve was, in detail, I think, it was like, I don't know, 5%, something, in this range, like, how much ETH, at the foundation, hall, at the time, there wasn't, that much value, ETH price, like 50 cents, one euro, or something, so, it was clear, this would not last, forever, so, I was thinking, about going back, to my PhD, or then, I came across, this idea, about Slockit, and building a company, and Slockit, was the idea, of, maybe, similar to Airlock, Smart contracts, are essentially, permission systems, 90% of a smart contract, is who's allowed, to do what, in case of the ERC-20, it's just, who's allowed, to send the token, or setting an allowance, and in terms of the DAO, it's who can vote, for what, and making decisions, and then, money gets censored, so, what if we could put, this permission system, into IoT, and who's allowed, to switch on, off, use, change, admin rights, whatever, you put, this into a small contract, and I thought, that Ether, will never become, a currency, Bitcoin, was a digital currency, and actually, if you talk, to Ethereum people, at the time, we were not thinking, about competing, with Bitcoin, Bitcoin, was a digital currency, we were building, a platform, for decentralized applications, Ether, was just used, to run it, so, I thought, okay, Ethereum, will not be used, as a currency, but it might be used, as a currency, for IoT devices, so, instead of the Internet of Things, building, the economy of things, and this, is kind of, what drove us, and then, we wanted, to build, this universal sharing network, as an application, at the time, Uber, and Airbnb, just became big, we thought, well, all those sharing economy services, should run, on chain, so, let's build, this, called, the universal sharing network, and
