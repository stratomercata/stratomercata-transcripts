**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:01] Okay, we are live, and we have a very special episode today.
[00:04] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain.
[00:09] Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:11] Hey, Victor.
[00:12] Hey, everyone.
[00:13] Hey.
[00:14] Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:16] John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:19] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:25] Yeah, sure.
[00:26] Um, so yeah, I—let's see, my crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:34] Yeah, I was—you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:38] I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[00:43] And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[00:52] And so yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:58] Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:01] Obviously, we met there, but what was that?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:03] No, so I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
[01:06] Yeah, I had actually met—I think John Lilic, which I forgot—but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center.
[01:11] I don't know if you guys remember that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:13] Yeah, we do.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:14] Yeah, yeah. So I was hanging around and actually I was like—I was super into Counterparty.
[01:18] So I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated, you know, Vitalik's full of it, it's not gonna work.
[01:23] And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong. Like, this is actually super cool.
[01:27] I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing.
[01:31] And I was just like googling "Ethereum blockchain hacker." I was trying to find—get deeper involved.
[01:36] You know, I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
[01:39] And so then I think I just googled it and it was like, oh, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[01:43] And I applied with Charles and then yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:46] Yeah, and to be clear, to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project.
[01:50] And we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:54] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Exactly.
[01:56] Yeah, I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:01] Yeah, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:04] Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
[02:06] I remember there was like a couple-week consulting transition period while, uh, you know—yeah, I think that's true.
[02:11] Maybe it was like, we started hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full-time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:15] Yeah. So with Counterparty, you could have been on Chris DeRose tech.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:18] Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:20] So what inspired SuperRare?
[02:22] Like, you know, I know you—when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[02:28] But what triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:35] Yeah, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[02:37] You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or like, you know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
[02:42] And like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[02:45] I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens.
[02:48] I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard.
[02:52] It's a super simple protocol, very simple code.
[02:55] But the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[02:58] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
[03:03] It was incredible to see that happen.
[03:05] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
[03:11] And I was like, well, this is pretty crazy.
[03:13] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[03:17] So like, it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
[03:21] And that, you know, like, I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[03:28] So that got me into NFTs.
[03:30] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like going to the art fairs.
[03:35] I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
[03:39] And it just seemed obvious.
[03:41] I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of truly own digital assets.
[03:44] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[03:47] So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:53] And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion?
[03:56] Because you guys—like, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going?
[04:01] And, you know, like no one is really paying attention.
[04:03] And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:07] It was absolutely crazy.
[04:08] It was hard to be like—it was just completely surreal the whole time.
[04:12] Like it felt like a dream.
[04:13] We started in 2018.
[04:15] We tried to raise money. It never really worked.
[04:18] By the time we raised, we were already cashflow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[04:23] So that's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:25] Yeah. It was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[04:30] So it was a grind. It was super volatile.
[04:33] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[04:36] But yeah, then it just really started.
[04:38] I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while.
[04:41] I remember it was October 2020 was our first million-dollar month in volume.
[04:45] And I was just like, this is wild.
[04:47] Because 12 months ago, we were like, all right, the volume was like $5,000.
[04:51] We made a couple hundred bucks. Okay.
