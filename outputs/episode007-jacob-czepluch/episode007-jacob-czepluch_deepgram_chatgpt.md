**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] So hello?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:03] Hello, Bob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:06] So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at dark Prague for early days of Ethereum.
[00:12] And I have here Jacob.
[00:14] Goodenough.
[00:16] Goodenough.
[00:18] Yes, there you go.
[00:20] So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:24] I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:29] I was not aware of your background and role, but specifically, you were an intern at Dev in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:39] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:43] Oh, yeah.
[00:45] Thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:47] Yeah.
[00:48] It was in Bogotá.
[00:50] I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then, but yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian—
[00:57] Florian Glatz, maybe—and talking about the old days, right?
[01:00] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.
[01:05] And, yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client, starting September or August 2015.
[01:13] I think it was maybe August to December?
[01:16] Yeah.
[01:17] It was August to December.
[01:19] I think it was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched.
[01:22] And the first week I was there was when there was the first big fork, where the Go client forked from the—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:27] —Plus and Python client?
[01:28] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:31] Yes.
[01:32] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:35] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.
[01:39] Right.
[01:40] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:45] And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this, because there were so many people who were just looking—some started leaving.
[01:53] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple of weeks before, back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:00] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:02] Yeah.
[02:03] I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:07] Oh, goodness.
[02:09] So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:12] I know exactly when it started.
[02:14] It started on 07/14/2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:18] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:19] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:23] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:25] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:29] So this was an internship while you were still doing your undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:32] No.
[02:33] It was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of ’15.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:39] Oh, I see.
[02:40] So you had graduated?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:42] Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:45] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:46] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then—
[02:51] Right, right.
[02:52] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:56] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to, like, the C++ client or something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:01] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:02] So yeah, I actually think I've known of Ethereum since 2014, but anyway.
[03:06] We wrote this bachelor thesis—me and two of my friends—and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.
[03:13] I was the only one—like, I was tired of studying already after only a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue, so I was like, okay, I’m going to do this.
[03:22] And a couple weeks later, moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:27] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:28] That was a very interesting time.
[03:31] Thinking back now, I’m sad I didn’t write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate it a little bit more, but I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[03:39] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:41] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?
[03:46] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:51] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:52] There were some different people out there, then some Python dev.
[03:55] He—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:56] —was doing Go stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:58] Right. And yeah, the Solidity team was also there—I think they were under the C++ team at the time.
[04:02] But they were there. And Remix as well—well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:07] And I also remember Mist, I guess—at least Fabian was also around.
[04:12] So there was a good amount of different people around.
[04:15] And also quite often, people would come and visit from other places.
[04:19] I remember a couple of times Christophe Jentsch came to visit.
[04:23] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that, and there was no one else at the office.
[04:28] I was doing my internship and I think he wrote in the late afternoon on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:36] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:37] So I was just like, oh, it’s fine.
[04:39] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:42] I had the smallest room, just like a small room with a bed—nothing else, basically.
[04:46] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep, because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:56] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:57] So, yeah, I had one night where I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[05:05] I got to know him.
[05:06] He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:10] Right, it was quite interesting.
[05:13] And that’s cross-client testing as well, wasn’t it?
[05:16] That was—the, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:20] —like, just JSON data that they fit to the client.
[05:23] And that was from the C++ client—I know that cpp-ethereum was leading—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:27] —and the tests were generated from that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:29] Mhmm.
[05:30] But then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:33] Probably, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:34] That sounds about right.
[05:36] But yeah, there are a lot of small stories.
[05:38] I know you told me we don't have too much time—I’ll try to keep it short.
[05:42] But I would say, if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like, of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:51] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:52] And also experiencing the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time—because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:59] Yep, that's right.
[06:00] The C++ team was kind of cut off.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:04] And you also had, you know, Ming Chan—her first official day was 1 August 2015.
[06:12] So, yeah, you basically had those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend, where, you know, it had been going for a year.
[06:20] It was the July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale, but nearly all of the money was gone in that year.
[06:28] And I think that was also, like, maybe not the most responsible—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:31] —like, usage of money, but also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:35] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:36] The Ether price itself was also—yeah, I think it dipped below the presale price at some point in—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:42] That's right. September, year end, and you'd had no accumulation.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:46] Yep.
[06:47] But, yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:50] So, maybe—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:51] —one thing I just remembered now: I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:58] Oh, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:59] Right.
[07:00] And a couple of weeks before that, was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:06] Right, because they were very rapidly losing funding or even shut down entirely, I think.
[07:11] Probably already caused this.
[07:14] All that was coming.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:16] Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead, because there was some budget.
[07:21] But, yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner, I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin’s office and had a chat there with him or whatever.
[07:34] And I didn’t really know in the beginning what was going on until—also I was asked if I wanted to come in and talk—and it was basically like presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team, and if we wanted to consider joining there or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:46] Yeah.
[07:47] So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became, later, Ethereum—later, Parity?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:52] Yeah, I think so.
[07:53] So I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on.
[07:56] I had no insight into the finances of the Foundation or anything like that—I only found out about most of those things later.
[08:03] But so maybe—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:05] —it's quite interesting to see.
[08:07] So, I mean, let's talk about Devcon 1.
[08:09] So, the first Devcon was Devcon 0, which happened in November 2014, before your time—which was a closed event, mainly Ethereum Foundation people, but some broader ecosystem people.
[08:18] But then Devcon 1 happened in November 2015 in London.
[08:23] It had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze, but then ConsenSys basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and did some organizing.
[08:32] So that was in November that year.
[08:34] I was not present myself; I couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time, but I watched a lot of the livestream.
[08:40] But, you know, that was a really seminal conference.
[08:44] So how was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:46] For me, it was amazing.
[08:48] I've never been good at sitting still on a chair for a long period of time, but there I was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end.
[08:55] I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my flight to go back on the last day—but I was just sitting there and soaking up all of these ideas and visions.
[09:04] And it was really—I think before that, I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space.
[09:12] But after Devcon 1, I was like, I have to do this.
[09:15] There's no other way for me.
[09:16] I'm not going back to the university.
[09:18] I'm not going to do anything else; this is what I'm going to do—because it was a full day, or three full days of just sitting there and people presenting their ideas.
[09:27] I remember clearly—like, Maker was presented.
[09:30] I was like, okay, we can do stablecoins—like, it was amazing.
[09:34] I think Fabian and Alex and some other people presented the ERC-20 token standard, or the early version of it, which—yeah, okay, this has also become such a big part of Ethereum now.
[09:43] I think maybe Gnosis, I’m not sure actually.
[09:46] And, of course, the project I was working on—the people there—we were presenting the Raiden Network, which got a lot of very good feedback as well.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:54] As well, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:56] Yeah.
[09:57] I was not so sold on Hydrogen back then, because it was aimed at—
[10:01] Yes.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:02] One of the very first permissioned Ethereum—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:04] Exactly, it was like a round robin kind of algorithm.
[10:07] And now it seems like something people would actually use these days.
[10:10] So, yeah, only ten years too early.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:12] But back to Devcon 1, I was just thinking about it after our conversation last night—
[10:16] That Devcon 1—it was just about the technology, I feel like.
[10:20] I think maybe there were three booths or something like that that just had a couple of stickers.
[10:25] I barely remember.
[10:27] I just remember—was it app... what was the name of the project?
[10:29] Block—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:30] —BlockApps Strato.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:31] Yeah, BlockApps.
[10:33] I remember they had a small booth, I think.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:36] Right, some stickers.
[10:38] I'm very sad that I lost that sticker.
[10:40] But other than that, it was just people.
[10:42] There was one stage and everyone was in the same room more or less, and in the evenings, people would go out for dinner maybe, but there was not a single side event, not a single party.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:51] Glory days.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:53] It was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's pies somewhere, and that was kind of fun—you got to know people really well.
[11:00] Yeah, it was really just the golden days, I felt like.
[11:03] So many inspired people and ideas, and people only talked about tech.
[11:07] I think there was one little bit weird product hype talk with a guy who had a t-shirt gun on stage.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:13] This "Free My Vunk"—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:15] Right, who had a very different energy than everybody else.
[11:18] It felt like he was the only one who actually knew how to give a talk and actually sell, and back then I thought it was way too much, but now that's basically what everyone else is doing.
[11:26] The quality of slides was so bad as well.
[11:29] It's so good to look back.
[11:30] But, yeah, I was thinking about that and comparing with, let's say, Devcon 2.
[11:35] I think at Devcon 2 there was maybe a couple of parties—I think ConsenSys had a bar somewhere where we would usually go.
[11:42] It was still not that big—still only one stage, I think, at Devcon 2.
[11:46] There was just one main stage.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:47] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:48] Quite doable.
[11:49] And then I think at Devcon 3 in Cancun, that was where you could really feel, okay, now there's a lot of money in this space, because there were parties right and left.
[11:58] And, yeah, okay, the rest is history.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:01] That's right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:02] It's been quite crazy to see this development as well, measuring on the amount of events and parties at the different Devcons—how popular things got.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:11] Absolutely.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:13] For me, Devcon 1 is one of my best memories of these ten years, simply because it was just so inspiring and motivating, I’d say.
[12:21] And a lot of the people you have on your list were around there—yeah, it's quite cool.
[12:27] I actually recently found out that someone I got to know, or a couple of years ago only, who's also doing some cool stuff, he was actually around there.
[12:35] We didn’t meet each other, didn’t know him—I only found out two years ago, but he had also been there.
[12:41] And he said he didn’t see almost any talks because he was sitting in the back trying to get LLL, Serpent, or Py-EVM or Geth client to run on his machine or something like that, because it was not easy back then.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:53] No.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:54] It took days—even if you had the devs available right next to you, it wasn't easy.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:59] No.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:01] So, yeah, I think that's mainly what I have to share, without going into too much detail about things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:06] Well, thanks so much.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:07] Yeah, you’re very welcome.
[13:09] Great chatting, always.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:11] Yeah.
[13:12] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:13] All the very best.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:14] Thank you.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:15] You too.
