Alright, let's tackle this transcript editing task. First, I need to understand the user's requirements. They want a clean, readable transcript that preserves all dialogue and content. The primary objective is to maintain the exact content while making necessary corrections.

Looking at the provided raw transcript, I notice several elements that need attention. The speakers are labeled as SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc., and each line has a timestamp. My job is to ensure all these timestamps are in the correct [MM:SS] format and that the content is properly formatted with bold speaker labels.

First, I'll check the technical terms and proper names against the provided lists. For example, "NFTs" should be capitalized, and names like "John Crane" need to be correctly spelled. There are mentions of "Super Rare," which is a project, so that should be capitalized as well.

Next, I'll look for any misspelled blockchain terms. The user provided a list of technical terms, so I'll cross-reference to ensure terms like "Ethereum," "NFTs," "DeFi," etc., are correctly spelled and capitalized. For instance, "etherium" should be "Ethereum," and "nfts" should be "NFTs."

Proper names like "Vitalik" (likely Vitalik Buterin) should be corrected to "Vitalik." Also, checking for any inconsistencies in speaker labels to ensure they remain as SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc., without adding actual names.

I'll also review the punctuation and sentence structure. The transcript has some run-on sentences and missing periods. For example, "Yeah, sure . So, yeah, I ." should be corrected to "Yeah, sure. So, yeah, I." Adding appropriate commas and periods where needed to enhance readability without altering the original meaning.

False starts and repetitions need to be addressed. Phrases like "I was— I mean I was going to say..." can be simplified to "I was going to say..." to maintain the flow while removing unnecessary fillers. However, I must be careful not to over-sanitize and preserve the natural conversation.

Timestamps are crucial. Each line must have a timestamp in [MM:SS] format. I'll verify that each line's timestamp is correctly formatted with two digits for both minutes and seconds, rounded to the nearest second. For example, "00:01" is correct, while "0.5s" would need to be converted to "00:01."

Paragraph breaks should be added at natural conversation transitions. If a new topic is introduced, a new paragraph should be created. This helps in readability without disrupting the original structure.

I'll also check for any missing content. The user emphasized preserving all dialogue and technical explanations. If any part of the conversation is missing in the raw transcript, I need to ensure it's included in the final output. For instance, if a speaker's line is cut off, I'll make sure it's completed as per the original.

Lastly, I'll validate the word count to ensure the output is approximately the same length as the input. If the output is significantly shorter, it means content was removed, which is not allowed. I'll adjust by restoring any omitted dialogue while maintaining the correct format.

Putting it all together, I'll go through each line, apply the corrections, and ensure the final transcript meets all the user's specifications without altering the original content's integrity.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today.
[00:05] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs.
[00:09] And we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane.
[00:13] Welcome, John Crane.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:17] Hey, Victor.
[00:19] Hey, everyone.
[00:21] Hey guys, thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:25] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of Super Rare.
[00:30] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:36] Yeah, sure.
[00:38] So, yeah, I.
[00:40] Let's see, my crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:48] Yeah, I was.
[00:50] Before that.
[00:52] My background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:55] I worked in advertising.
[00:57] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[01:01] And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[01:10] And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art, so doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:17] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:19] Remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:23] Obviously we met there, but like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:27] Yeah, well, yeah, no, so I was, I was kind of hanging out with the New York bitcoin crowd.
[01:32] Yeah, I had actually met, I think John Lilick, which I forgot, but I met him at the, like the New York Bitcoin Center.
[01:39] I don't know if you guys remember that.
[01:41] Yeah, yeah.
[01:43] So I was hanging around and actually I was like, I was super into counterparty, so I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated.
[01:50] You know, Vitalik's full of shit, it's not going to work.
[01:54] And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong.
[01:58] Like, this is actually super cool.
[02:01] I have no problem changing.
[02:03] I was like, I was totally wrong.
[02:05] This is amazing.
[02:07] And I was just like Googling Ethereum, blockchain, hackathon.
[02:11] I was like trying to find like, get deeper involved.
[02:14] I was trying to like quit my day job and go full time crypto.
[02:18] And so then I, I think I just googled it and it was like, oh, shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[02:23] And I applied with Charles and then.
[02:25] Yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:29] Yeah.
[02:31] And.
[02:33] And to be clear, you.
[02:35] To let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you, in Web three.
[02:43] Right.
[02:45] We gave you that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:49] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[02:51] Exactly.
[02:53] I think I.
[02:55] I think that like the Monday after, like, I.
[02:58] I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on block apps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:03] Yeah, well, I, we, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys.
[03:07] Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:10] There was like a couple week consulting transition period while, you know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:14] Yeah, I think that's true.
[03:16] Yeah.
[03:18] Maybe it was like we started like hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full time.
[03:23] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:26] So with counterparty you, you could have been on Christa Rose Tech.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:30] Yeah, exactly.
[03:32] If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:34] So what inspired Super Rare?
[03:37] Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[03:45] But you know, what, what triggered you to kind of create Super Rare, which is what, for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:53] Yeah, I.
[03:55] Well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[03:58] You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC20 tokens.
[04:10] And I found it was super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard is a super simple protocol, very simple code.
[04:15] But the adoption created this.
[04:17] There's massive wealth generation.
[04:19] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for, you know, humans and the economy.
[04:24] Like, it was like, incredible to see that happen.
[04:27] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC721 and like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
[04:35] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[04:39] Like, it could be that, like the entire consumer web turns into like, NFTs and that, you know, like, I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the, you know, the, the total addressable market's probably pretty large.
[04:50] So that got me into NFTs.
[04:52] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like, you know, going to the art fairs.
[04:58] I had friends who were, you know, looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the, you know, the business of art.
[05:03] And it just seemed obvious.
[05:05] I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets.
[05:09] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[05:12] So it's kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:18] And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of like the NFT explosion?
[05:22] Because you guys, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, you know, like, how's it going?
[05:27] And you know, like no one is really paying attention.
[05:29] And all of a sudden, you know, next day everyone's talking about.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:33] It was absolutely crazy.
[05:35] It was hard.
[05:37] You like, it was just like completely surreal the whole time.
[05:40] Like it felt like a dream.
[05:42] Like we, you know, we started in 2018.
[05:45] We, we were, we tried to raise money.
[05:47] It never really worked.
[05:49] Like by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and like making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:55] So that's best situation to possibly be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:58] Yeah, it was like it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[06:03] So yeah, it was like, you know, it was a grind.
[06:06] It was super volatile.
[06:08] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[06:11] But yeah, then it just, it just really started.
[06:14] Like I remember the numbers were like doubling every month for a while.
[06:18] Like I remember it was October 2020.
[06:20] It was our first million dollar month in volume.
[06:23] And I was just like, this is wild.
[06:25] But 12 months ago we were like, all right, so the volume was like $5,000 and we made a couple hundred bucks.
[06:31] Okay.
[06:33] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:35] And were you guys the first self minting NFT platform?
[06:39] I think like we were trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:42] Yeah, we were the first to come.
[06:44] Like I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience.
[06:50] So it was like there weren't great minting tools then.
[06:53] So we started with the minting tool and then we're like, all right, I guess people need a place to start sell this.
[06:58] So we'll like, we'll build the marketplace too.
[07:01] And you know, it's partially just out of necessity because like the, the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:06] Yeah, I, I, it's, it's funny because I remember if you recall the what later became the Flow guys doing cryptokitties, they were based in Vancouver and I was like talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.
[07:18] But, and I mean you've done so much.
[07:20] One of the amazing things, it's the launch of the Rare token.
[07:23] And you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality, like what led to that and how did that go?
[07:30] What did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:33] Yeah, I mean, early on I was part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network.
[07:43] There's the fat protocol article that was super popular 2016.
[07:46] So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like?
[07:49] And can you build platforms that are more like collaborative than extractive, where it's like if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just going to extract as much metadata, you know, sell ads, you know, which is a great business.
[07:59] But partially for me, it was almost like a, you know, a thought experiment of like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads?
[08:05] And it could be like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model and then, you know, kind of it's like collective ownership via the token.
[08:11] So, yeah, you know, drink.
[08:13] Drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time.
[08:16] Still am, yeah, I guess to be.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[08:19] Did you do it like classic ICO style?
[08:21] Was there like fixed price auction?
[08:23] How did the rare get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:26] Yeah, we actually just did a huge airdrop.
[08:29] Probably one of our mistakes.
[08:31] Yeah, so we should have probably sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away.
[08:36] And yeah, I mean there's plenty of challenges to Dows are hard to manage and run, but you know, it's cool to see the current administration kind of like change tack and actually seem like they're interested in like building and pushing forward.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:45] So what do you think the biggest challenge was and what do you think?
[08:49] You know, the biggest challenge was in running a dao because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool Aid, you know, running things completely decentral.
[08:57] What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:01] Yeah, I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory.
[09:05] Like you have, you're like, you're kind of like trying to read the tea leaves.
[09:08] And then rather than just making like the bet, you're like, okay, this is the simplest, best decision.
[09:12] You're like, okay, well this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this.
[09:15] And like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment and it's obviously, you know, the position is friendlier but there's still no clear like rules.
[09:23] You know, it's like the obviously like the Gensler era of you know, enforcement, the dark ages.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:28] You know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[09:30] Gary's going to be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[09:34] Man?
[09:36] Do you think of it, the advice, do you think of it more like it should be like a representative democracy.
[09:40] Like should we be like passing bills in there?
[09:42] I think they're like, they're proposals and there's like delegation usually is the model.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:46] Yeah.
[09:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[09:50] It could also be like just like you got a couple leaders but the stake could call no confidence vote or something.
[09:55] Or like people like you talking too.
[09:57] I haven't tried it yet, but what's that like Metadow is trying to do that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:01] Sort of.
[10:03] Yeah.
[10:05] I think it kind of depends on specifically what you're doing.
[10:08] If it's something like Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not dows, but just like where it's like if small changes can have potentially catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing.
[10:16] If it's super rare, where it's like there's a low level protocol and there's application and you know, other than like the escrow contracts for auctions and things like the stakes are like fairly low.
[10:25] I do kind of like the idea of like you sort of like if you can empower like a team or a few individuals to kind of just keep going and then the token holders can say like tell people to stop versus like having to approve everything.
[10:35] Like that's a very silly, arduous process and I feel like it should be more like okay if you're, it's like veering off in the wrong direction.
[10:41] You can like there's a way to kind of like raise your voice and how influence it but like, you know, having a vote on like what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:48] I'm curious like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance like being a curated kind of platform and being open, you know, like how do you think about those two?
[10:58] Because I think one of the advantages of super rare with the curation side in art, you keep the quality very, very high and yeah, unlike you know, more marketplace type NFT platforms which just frankly puts a ton of crap like out there.
[11:08] So.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:10] Yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:12] How do you balance those two and kind of keep decentralized, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:16] Yeah, no, it is.
[11:18] I mean it's kind of challenging and it's almost, almost a paradox.
[11:21] I think we've kind of always taken the minimal decentralization.
[11:24] So it's like have it where it's useful.
[11:27] And then one example is we were talking about token models early on.
[11:30] It was like maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists.
[11:33] And I was just like that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine.
[11:37] It's like people voting like your art's terrible.
[11:39] You're like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:42] I mean in the, the pump fun streamer heyday.
[11:45] I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:48] Exactly.
[11:50] Yeah.
[11:52] You know, maybe.
[11:54] Yeah.
[11:56] It's like live voting like is our good or bad?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:59] Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:02] I, I did start on a dating project once where, where you basically had to be voted in based on your looks, which seems horrible.
[12:08] Yeah, Very, very evil.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:10] You know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[12:12] Remember those?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:14] Yes, yes.
[12:16] Or hot or not or all those.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:19] Oh yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:21] It's.
[12:23] Yeah, yeah.
[12:25] Just, just brutal.
[12:27] But I.
[12:29] And yeah, especially in places, you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:33] Yeah.
[12:35] It's challenging and you know, are like good art is subjective.
[12:39] So that you know, it's like I feel like the on chain auctions, escrow on chain.
[12:43] That makes a lot of sense.
[12:45] Like on chain voting for which artists are good, that's kind of like let people who are making decisions do their thing and then if it starts to be, if things get out of hand, maybe the token holders can raise awareness.
[12:55] But.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:57] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:59] Part of it too.
[13:01] I mean actually early on we were like thought we would be more of an open platform.
[13:05] And then as things progressed there were more tools.
[13:08] Like you know, we were just trying, it was like we were building things, trying to add value and there's a ton of open tooling.
[13:13] So like early on we kind of thought we might have like super error as like the ultra curated view into the market.
[13:18] And then maybe you have like, you know, another kind of like open platform that's anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:23] But I'm, I'm curious like what was the.
[13:26] Like what like you know, it's a two sided market with market artists and art buyers.
[13:30] Like what do you think?
[13:32] Like did you have to get the artist first and convince them and how did you do that or did you have to get the art buyers?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:37] Yeah, we, you know you kind of had to get both first.
[13:40] So I mean we started like just you know, out of like it really started as just me kind of like experimenting and building and so we were like, you know, started with the minting tools I was going around like demoing, talking to people and I guess we at first kind of piqued interest of the artists.
[13:52] Like I was, you know, like we were like talking about how it would work.
[13:55] And then when we first launched though, we kind of had.
[13:58] So there's Jason Bailey, who was kind of like an early digital art advocate, big writer.
[14:02] He ran a company or runs a company called Club NFT that does like NFT art backups.
[14:06] And he hit us up and was like, hey guys, we've been talking to him.
[14:09] And he was like, I know you're getting close with your product.
[14:12] Like, I want to buy this art on Monday.
[14:14] Can we.
[14:16] Can I do it on super Rare?
[14:18] And I like looked at Charlie and I was like, dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet on Monday.
[14:22] Like, what can we.
[14:24] That was in like 36 hours that Charlie was like, yeah, probably.
[14:27] And so then we basically stayed up for 36 hours fixing bugs.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:31] I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said, we want to launch Blockchain as a service with you at DEFCON 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:36] And we were like, exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:38] Oh my God.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:40] Like that's like many parallels.
[14:42] Nothing like a good deadline to get.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:45] Yeah, exactly.
[14:47] Especially with a big, you know, major partner that, you know, can make or break you.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[14:51] Right, so yeah, just don't have live demos on the end of all that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:55] Yeah, exactly.
[14:57] That's when it gets real risky.
[14:59] We actually.
[15:01] So when we did it, there was a, there was a funny bug with the like the react stuff.
[15:05] So we were live helping.
[15:07] We were live streaming or not live streaming, but screen sharing.
[15:10] The transaction with this artist, Robbie Barat and Jason and we're literally pushing fixes.
[15:14] It was like, oh, we didn't know.
[15:16] I didn't expect that to happen.
[15:18] Like, okay, one second.
[15:20] All right, it's deployed.
[15:22] Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:25] Lots of couch clearing in.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:27] That.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:29] I, you know, like, I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally like art and NFTs.
[15:34] Like, you know, can I jump in on this?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:37] Yeah, please take a take on it.
[15:39] So in defi, we're starting to see like as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a trad fi defi merger.
[15:47] It's not all the way there yet, but it's, you know, getting to just be fi.
[15:51] Like I see the path to that happening.
[15:53] Do you think like it's.
[15:55] NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever?
[15:59] I know you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery.
[16:02] I know you started to do a lot of like physical sales.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:05] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:07] Etc.
[16:09] Like, does it kind of what.
[16:11] Or you know, do they merge?
[16:13] Do they not?
[16:15] Do they.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:17] Yeah, that does.
[16:19] Like, yeah, like trad art become NFT art and digital art or like.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:23] Yeah, I, you know, I think like the NFT stuff I do think kind of just like eventually fades into the background.
[16:28] Like the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance.
[16:32] So, you know, you could use that for physical art, you could use it for digital.
[16:35] I think it was like more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kind of argue the token is the art.
[16:39] You now have this, you know, more liquid asset.
[16:42] So for art specifically.
[16:44] Yeah, it's kind of just becoming part of the market.
[16:47] And I think you'll see NFTs, you know, used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art.
[16:52] Like no one's really, if you like the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and like collectibles in general is like kind of amazing.
[16:58] Like it's still like, oh, there's a stage sticker on the back that this says it was from this gallery.
[17:02] Probably it was, probably it was.
[17:04] Nobody knows.
[17:06] And so, and also I think, you know, like a lot of people are like really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally.
[17:13] It's like if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity, like that's kind of good enough.
[17:18] You don't really need some complicated tech solution.
[17:21] There's.
[17:23] And it's hard to imagine a world in which collectors and customers, you just want.
[17:27] I personally have a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it.
[17:31] And I think in general that trend continues.
[17:34] I think digital art will kind of just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market and then eventually we'll see NFTs used as certificates of authenticity for all high value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:42] Yeah, I mean one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist and she often gets a request for the value that was paid for it because someone wants to insure it.
[17:52] Right.
[17:54] And there's this whole downstream kind of.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:57] Economy insurance appraisal, like lending, you need much better.
[18:00] And so it's like, I mean, Kieran, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit.
[18:04] It's like, I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information.
[18:08] You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to provenance.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:12] Let me add a little on on that front.
[18:14] So I felt having been more of an NFT style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more defi.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:18] We.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:19] I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true.
[18:22] But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock liquidity in selling.
[18:25] Could be one way, but people kind of want to hold on to stuff like, I don't want to sell my eth.
[18:29] I don't want to sell my, you know, et cetera.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:32] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:34] You would know better than us at the very high end of the market.
[18:37] You know, if you get like a wealth manager, they'll.
[18:39] They might extend some credit against your Picasso.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:42] Right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:43] Or.
[18:45] But for everybody else and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that too.
[18:48] You can't really like.
[18:50] I don't know if people fire.
[18:52] Sell their art, but it tends to sit there.
[18:55] And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there.
[18:58] But the credit markets actually just make it liquid, you know, as we've, as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.
[19:04] Like, yeah, I'm surprised.
[19:06] Or we're getting into that world, but we're not.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:09] Yeah, we're seeing it.
[19:11] I feel like there's the green shoots of like, okay, here's what's possible.
[19:14] It totally makes sense.
[19:16] I think just like NFTs almost as is.
[19:18] Like, they're a great.
[19:20] We talk.
[19:22] A lot of people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff.
[19:25] And like, to me it's like NFTs are like a beautiful, very simple digital identity for whatever.
[19:29] You can pack anything you want in that metadata.
[19:32] There's just like packet full of stuff.
[19:34] It's very simple.
[19:36] They're unique.
[19:38] Point to one.
[19:40] They're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:43] Yeah, I mean, I, I love the way you talk about, you know, NFTs as certificates of authenticity because I didn't realize this.
[19:49] We looked into like the physical art market for a while.
[19:52] And like every auction at Sotheby's, when they have a big piece, like they have to research it effectively from scratch.
[19:57] Right.
[19:59] Like they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:04] Yeah, it's a very high friction.
[20:07] Like the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good, depending on where your position is in the market.
[20:12] Obviously Southeast loves being the Keeper of all secrets and information.
[20:16] But I think that's clearly going to be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[20:20] Any new maybe.
[20:22] Are you guys, you know, just to declare war on the auction houses, houses, you know, other high end physical goods.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:27] What?
[20:29] Yeah, I mean we're focusing like our expansion like you know, we launched the gallery earlier this year offline gallery.
[20:33] It's on the Bowery, right next to new museum.
[20:36] And you know, we're showing physical digital art, you know, installations, you know, projections, all sorts of different things.
[20:42] And yeah, I think like, you know, our view, like if you look at the models, like they're all like the galleries are not doing great, you know, business wise.
[20:49] The auction houses are hurting.
[20:51] I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model and stuff is so illiquid.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[20:56] Right.
[20:58] I mean to interrupt.
[21:00] Right.
[21:02] It's just enormous stuff sitting five years, 10 years with, you know, and it's feast or famine.
[21:07] Like if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[21:11] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:12] Just wait.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[21:14] Yeah.
[21:16] Like 20, 21 people were just, you know, you know, buying Picassos on their phones.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[21:21] And crazy ape, crazy apes.
[21:23] Right.
[21:25] So they all.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[21:27] Everything every year like Ether rocks.
[21:30] I remember when Ether Rocks were like the price is exploding.
[21:33] And I was like this is really amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[21:36] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[21:38] Yeah.
[21:40] I think like the models have to change and you know, just as like if you think what the Internet's done as far as like shopping, right.
[21:46] It's like you can price compare easily on your phone in any storage, right.
[21:49] There's no kind of like price arbitrage.
[21:51] You're like, you're gonna look up the price of something, you can scan something, figuring you like ask chat GPT.
[21:56] What is, you know, what is this?
[21:58] How much should it cost?
[22:00] And so I think like the art world has really, it has been like an insider's game of who knows who and like what's the real price?
[22:06] Like the marketed price versus like what was actually paid.
[22:09] And I think that's gonna like, it's gonna slowly be like unwinding and we'll, we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent.
[22:15] You can see things on chain and I mean I think that's, you know, like, that's kind of like part of the opportunity is as the market becomes more efficient, we'll have the best tools to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[22:23] So it sounds like even the big guys want more liquidity, but they're not willing to let go of their proprietary information advantage, I guess.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:28] Yeah, exactly.
[22:30] And that's Kind of also the paradox.
[22:32] It's like you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information.
[22:35] But it's the classic.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[22:37] What's the, the innovator's dilemma.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:40] The innovator dilemma, exactly.
[22:42] I was like, yeah, tip my tongue.
[22:44] Yeah, classic innovator dilemma.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:47] Well I, I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer.
[22:52] Right.
[22:54] To, to the places.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:56] Yeah, they have.
[22:58] I mean I like they're all Christie's inside of me.
[23:01] Like a lot of the bait or most of the auction houses they're private so I don't know how big their businesses are but they do have.
[23:07] Yeah, there's like, you know, people will like inherit art and it's like they don't really care necessarily.
[23:11] And their advisor was like don't sell that.
[23:13] You should just take out a loan.
[23:15] And so they do have them.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[23:18] But that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point.
[23:21] Right?
[23:23] Like oh, we'll tell you how much it's worth and we'll loan you based on that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:26] Yeah, it's very one sided and you can't really shop it around.
[23:29] It's like ultra specialized information.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[23:32] Jim, did you want to ask a question?
[23:34] You look like you, you came off mute.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:37] Well, it's a little bit of a different topic but I'll throw it in right now anyway.
[23:41] What has been the effect for good or bad of AI on and art on what you're doing?
[23:46] Yeah, as far as the startup goes it's been great where like you know, you can now we had a little robot in our slack you can talk to that does things for you.
[23:52] As far as the art market goes, I think it's all, I mean it's also been kind of great.
[23:55] Like in my mind this is just like, you know, it's a new tool that unlocks creative.
[23:59] You know like you can kind of like do different creative things.
[24:02] It you're encouraging it then.
[24:04] Yeah, oh yeah.
[24:06] We have like tons of artists use AI.
[24:08] I mean, you know there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and you think it's the end of all creativity.
[24:12] But I think just like, you know, if you look hist.
[24:15] I think you like what it really enables is like somebody to do more complex things.
[24:18] You know, it's like where you can like all the grunt work you don't have to do.
[24:21] So now maybe it's instead of making one still image you're going to do insane world building where it's like, you can go in, you can.
[24:27] You know, like, the art's just more interactive.
[24:29] And actually, the first art we ever sold on Super Air was kind of, like, generated via, like, gans, like, adversarial networks, like, voting on outcomes.
[24:37] So I think, you know, it's inevitable it's gonna happen.
[24:39] It's kind of like, you know, digital cameras were the end of photography, and they obviously were not.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[24:44] Well, do you think, like, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority, that proving some part was based, you know, done by a human will be valued into art or.
[24:53] Or any kind of creation going forward?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:56] Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, just like, if you, you know, it's like, it's super amazing to see, like, the rate at which content's being created.
[25:01] And, like, you know, people.
[25:03] It's like you can watch a video of, like, that person didn't actually say that, but it looks like they did.
[25:07] I think that's where you're like, nobody ever answers a random phone number.
[25:10] If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, I would literally never answer this.
[25:14] Like, I don't know who does that.
[25:16] You'd have to be, like, pretty insane.
[25:18] And so it's sort of like you've kind of certified the numbers, you know, And I think it'll end up being the same with, like, content and, like, art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't, you know, signed somehow, cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[25:27] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[25:29] Because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[25:32] Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and runes?
[25:37] Like, how.
[25:39] How is that looking?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[25:41] Yeah, we've done a couple projects on runes with artists, and, yeah, it's super interesting.
[25:45] You know, we're.
[25:47] Yeah, I think there's going to be art on many blockchains.
[25:50] Obviously.
[25:52] Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure, probably have the highest likelihood of it lasting.
[25:56] But, yeah, actually, people really like ordinals.
[25:59] It's funny.
[26:01] One of the sort of paradoxes, or the funny things we ran into is early on we would talk to investors, and they're like, you need to get rid of the wallet.
[26:07] It's too complicated.
[26:09] But actually, it kind of ends up being this.
[26:11] You got to know all the right terms.
[26:13] It's almost like you get the secret incantation, you get inducted into the club, and you know how it works.
[26:18] And so, like, I think people really like that.
[26:20] Ordinals are a little more complex and like harder to understand than NFTs on Ethereum, which is just.
[26:24] Yeah, sort of.
[26:26] That's a funny anecdote but yeah, they're quite popular.
[26:29] I think they'll be around for a while.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[26:32] And, and I mean another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:38] Yeah, yeah, totally.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[26:40] I'm curious about the decision to, you know, you mentioned starting the gallery and like everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real world stuff into the blockchain, but you're kind of doing the opposite.
[26:51] Like what was the decision to start a physical gallery?
[26:54] And you know, why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:58] Yeah, I mean just you know, it's part, it's kind of part of like how you know, like the, the market works.
[27:03] Like you know, people like getting together and like a lot of the art, you know, it's like you can look at it on your phone but if you see it, you know, on the huge projector there's like, you know, a 10 by 10 CRT, like TV wall.
[27:13] It really looks different.
[27:15] So I think you know, part of it is like it's community building, it's a space people can show up.
[27:19] And then part of it's like, you know, like the art really does just look different.
[27:22] So I think you know, as far as like NFTs still, you know, people are like, okay, these are just nonsense JPEGs.
[27:27] It's ether rocks 2.0 or whatever like.
[27:29] And so like it's kind of like telling the story to everyone else because at the end of the day it's still like, you know, it's, it's a demand constrained market and we're, you know, we're trying to grow the collector base beyond art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[27:38] What do you see as like the next area?
[27:40] Like you know, what's the next areas that are kind of gonna need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority?
[27:46] I mean I can think of a million.
[27:48] But I'm just curious from your point of view, where do you see, where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[27:52] Yeah, I, I mean I think in general it's like, you know, like luxury assets.
[27:56] Right.
[27:58] Like NFTs are still more expensive to create than like not having one.
[28:01] You know, like you just print one out and then the ID lives in your database.
[28:05] Yeah.
[28:07] And you know, and I think.
[28:09] But it's going to be like the customers are going to have to demand it.
[28:12] You know, like a lot of like the brokers and folks like, they do like their kind of like information advantage and so they don't really want this to exist.
[28:18] But I think it just makes so much sense.
[28:20] It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen.
[28:23] So.
[28:25] And we're see like, you know, there's people taking wine very seriously, issuing NFTs and like, you know, building secondary markets.
[28:30] I think part of it's like an asset that's kind of fun to speculate on.
[28:33] But also you do you like there's, you know, a high likelihood you might, you know, have somebody send you the nft.
[28:38] It's like kind of like wine watches.
[28:40] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:42] Handbags, I think are a big one.
[28:44] Like.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:46] Exactly.
[28:48] Yeah, yeah.
[28:50] One of the really popular ones right now is trading cards.
[28:53] So they're like, you know what people like is like courtyard is still going, right?
[28:57] I think.
[28:59] Yeah, they're doing great.
[29:01] Yeah, it's, you know, kind of like you have the speculative aspect, but also like if you're a serious collector, you can, you know, get, get real, get real things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[29:08] Okay, last question for you because we, unless anyone else has one, but no.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[29:12] No, no, we just want.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[29:14] What are you most excited about in any aspect of the blockchain space right now?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[29:18] Most excited.
[29:20] I mean, it's like, it's obviously like we, you know, like we've all been working on this for like a super long time, but I do think like if you look at even just like, you know, black rocks, putting treasuries on chain with different partners, like arts, moving on chain.
[29:31] Like, like everything literally is going to become, is moving on chain.
[29:34] Like I think it's like that's actually finally.
[29:36] It used to just be like a mantra people would say to help themselves feel important, but I think we're finally getting there.
[29:41] We're like, holy fuck.
[29:43] Everything is moving on chain.
[29:45] That's actually happening.
[29:47] So it's like real world assets, digital assets.
[29:50] I think just like, yeah, liquidity is increasing.
[29:52] I think it's generally net positive for everyone.
[29:55] It feels actually like it's finally happening.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[29:58] So, yeah, it's taken way longer, you know, 10 years, but we're still here and we're still doing it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[30:03] You know, we can make like a thumbnail like the Rob that's happening.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[30:06] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:08] We need the Mission Accomplished banner, you know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[30:11] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[30:13] Oh my goodness.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:15] Yeah, exactly.
[30:17] Well, John, thank you for your time and as always we're really glad that you're doing so well and where can people find you and learn more about all the stuff you do?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[30:23] Yeah.
[30:25] On X At Super Air, John.
[30:27] At Super Air.
[30:29] Yeah, we're.
[30:31] Yeah, you should.
[30:33] Also, there's.
[30:35] There's currently a show at the gallery that's wrapping up, but we have a new.
[30:38] There's an x copy show December 10th, so if anyone's in town.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[30:42] Gallery one more time.
[30:44] I missed it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[30:46] Oh, yeah.
[30:48] Offline by Super Air.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[30:50] Offline by superware.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:52] Well, awesome.
[30:54] Thank you for joining us.
[30:56] And take care, everyone.
[30:58] Thank you.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[31:00] Thanks for having me.
