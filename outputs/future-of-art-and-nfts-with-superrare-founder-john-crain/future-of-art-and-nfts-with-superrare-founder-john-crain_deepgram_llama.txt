**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay.
We are live, and we have a very special episode today.
We are talking about the future of art and NFTs,
and we're joined by special guest and very old friend,
John Crane.
Welcome, John Crane.
Hey, Victor.
Hey, everyone.
Hey.
Good to see you guys.
Thanks for having me.
John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of Super Rare.
But do wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
Sure.
So, yeah, I
let's see.
My crypto journey started in around 2015,
going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met,
at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
Yeah.
I was you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
I worked in advertising.
I studied architecture and structural engineering
for undergrad.
And,
yeah, I was always really interested in
when crypto and blockchain were gonna, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were,
a little bit past,
you know, finance and trading.
And, like,
watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I met me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens, and, like,
I found it was, like, super interesting that it was this very small
bit of stand like, you know, it's a it's a super
simple protocol, very simple code.
But, like, the adoption created this like, yeah, there's massive wealth generation.
And even if there were also lots of scams,
I'd say generally net positive for,
you know, humans and the economy.
Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen.
And
so then I saw some of the standards conversations
around ERC-seven
21, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
And
I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
If you think about
the consumer web,
it's all,
you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata.
So, like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, like
I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the, you know, the the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
So that got me into NFTs.
And then
on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, like, know, going to the art fairs.
I had friends who were,
you know, looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the, you know, the business of art.
And
it just seemed obvious.
I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets,
and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art.
So it's kinda like the marriage of,
you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And, like,
what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion?
Because you guys like, I I know for a long time you were building, and it was like,
oh, you know, like, how's it going?
And, you know, the like,
no one is really paying attention.
And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It it was absolutely crazy.
It was hard to be like it's just, like, completely surreal the whole time.
Like, it felt like a dream.
Like, we,
you know, we started in 2018.
We we were we tried to raise money.
It never really worked.
Like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and, like, making more than we were paying ourselves.
So That's best situation to possibly be.
Yeah.
It was, like, it was a it was a grind.
It was super volatile many times.
I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
But,
yeah, then it just it just really started, like I remember
the numbers were, like, doubling every month for a while.
Like, remember it was October
2020.
It was our first million dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild.
You know?
Because but,
you know, twelve months ago, we were like, alright.
So the volume was, like, $5,000,
and we made a couple $100.
Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
And were were you guys the first self minting NFT platform?
I think, like, we're we were trying to talk about that, actually.
Yeah.
We

**SPEAKER_01:**
yeah.
We were the first to come like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but, like, we were the first to combine, like, the minting and the marketplace experience.
So was like,
there weren't, like, great minting tools then.
So we're like, we started with the minting tool, and then we're like, alright.
I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll, like, we'll build the marketplace too.
And, you know, it's partially just out of necessity because, like, the the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
I I it's it's funny because I remember, if you recall,
the what labor became the flow guys doing CryptoKitties.
They were based in Vancouver, and I was, like Mhmm.
Talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.
But
and, I mean, you've done so much.
One of the amazing things that it's the launch of the rare token,
and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance
in reality?
Like, how how you know, what what led to that, and how did that go?
Like, how you know, what did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, you know, early on, I was, like, part of, like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where,
you know, the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network.
You know, like, there there's the, like, the
fat protocol article
that was, you know, super popular, like, 2016.
So just, like, thinking about, like, okay.
What does monetization look like?
And,
you know, can you build platforms that are,
you know, like they're more, like, collaborative than extractive, where it's like, you know, if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and, you know, sell ads,
you know, which is a great business.
But, partially,
for me, it was almost like a, you know,
a thought experiment of, like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be, like maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kinda it's, like, collective ownership via the token.
So,
yeah, I was, you know, drink drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time.
Did you trust that?
I still am.
Yeah.
I guess to be Yeah.
Yeah.
But Did you do it, like, classic

**SPEAKER_03:**
ICO style?
Was there, like, fixed price auction?
How how did it how did the rare get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
We actually just did a huge airdrop.
Probably one of our mistakes Yeah.
Is, like,
So, like, we should've probably, you know, sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away.
And yeah.
I mean, yeah, there's plenty of challenges to, like you know, DAOs are hard to manage and run.
But,
yeah, it's cool to see the current administration kinda, like, change tack and actually seem like they're interested in, like, building and pushing forward.
So

**SPEAKER_00:**
What do you think the biggest challenge was in what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO?
Because I think all of us had that sort of
as an ideal state with the crypto kool aid, you know, running things completely decentral.
What do you think are,
you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory.
Regulatory.
Like, you have you know, like, you're kinda, like, trying to read the tea leaves, and then rather than just making, like, the bet you're like, okay.
Well, this is the simplest, best decision.
You're like, okay.
Well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this.
And, like, how do we,
you know,
not get in trouble for trying to experiment?
And it's obviously you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules.
You know, it's like
the Do you think like, the the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The dark the dark ages.
You know?
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting

**SPEAKER_03:**
transition period while

**SPEAKER_01:**
you know?
Yeah.
I think that's true.
Yeah.
Maybe it was, like, we started, like, hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then
full time.
So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So So with Counterparty,
you you could have been on.
Yeah.
Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So what inspired
SuperRare?
Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
But, you know, what
triggered you to kind of
create super rare, which is what for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I
well, I mean, it was super interesting.
Right?
You know, like, we were all kind of on the Ground Floor
at the consensus office or, like, know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
And, like,
watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I met me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens, and, like,
I found it was, like, super interesting that it was this very small
bit of stand like, you know, it's a it's a super
simple protocol, very simple code.
But, like, the adoption created this like, yeah, there's massive wealth generation.
And even if there were also lots of scams,
I'd say generally net positive for,
you know, humans and the economy.
Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen.
And
so then I saw some of the standards conversations
around ERC-seven
21, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
And
I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
If you think about
the consumer web,
it's all,
you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata.
So, like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, like
I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the, you know, the the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
So that got me into NFTs.
And then
on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, like, know, going to the art fairs.
I had friends who were,
you know, looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the, you know, the business of art.
And
it just seemed obvious.
I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets,
and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art.
So it's kinda like the marriage of,
you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And, like,
what was the like, what like, you know, it's a two sided market with market artists
and art buyers.
Like, what do you think like,
did you have to get the artist first to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the art first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
We
you know, you kinda had to get both first.
So, I mean, we started, like, just, you know, out of, like it really started as just me kinda, like, experimenting and building.
And so we were, like you know, started with the minting tools.
I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people.
And
I guess we it first kinda piqued interest of the artist.
Like, I was you know, like, we were, like, talking about how it would work.
And then
when we when we first launched, though, we kinda had
so there's Jason Bailey, who was kinda like a early,
you know, digital art advocate.
He you know, big writer.
He ran a company or runs a company called Club NFT that does, like, NFT art backups.
Yeah.
And
he hit us up and was like, hey, guys.
Like, you know, we've been talking to him, and he was like, I know you're gonna close with your products.
Like, I wanna buy this art on Monday.
Can we can I do it on super air?
And I, like, looked at Charlie, and I was like,
dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet on Monday.
Like, what can we do?
Like,
that was That was
in, like, we had, like, thirty six hours that Charlie was like, yeah.
Probably.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And so then we basically stayed up for thirty six hours, fixing bugs.
And I'm getting I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said we wanna launch blockchain as a service with you at DEFCON one, and we were like Exactly.
Oh my god.
Like, that's like There there are many parallels.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Nothing like a good deadline to get, you know, Exactly.
Like
Especially with a big, you know, major

**SPEAKER_02:**
partner that, you know, can make or break you.
Right?
So Yeah.
No.
Just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, yeah.
Exactly.
That's when it gets real risky.
We actually so when we did it, there was a there was a funny bug with the, like, the React stuff.
So we're, like, live, like, helping we were, like, live streaming or not live streaming, but, like, screen sharing the transaction with this artist, Ravi Bharat and Jason.
And we're, like, literally pushing fixes.
It was like, oh, we didn't know didn't expect that to happen.
Like, okay.
One second.
Like, alright.
It's deployed.
Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Lots of cash clearing in in Exactly.
I don't remember about that.
I you know, like, I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally, like, art and NFT is like, you know Can I jump in on this?
Yeah.
Please.
Give take a take on it.
So in DeFi, we're starting to see like, as the administration has cleared the way to some extent,

**SPEAKER_03:**
it seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a TradFi,
DeFi merger.
It's not all the way there yet,
but it's,
you know, getting to just be FI.
Like, I see the path to that Yeah.
Happening.
Do you think, like, it's NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever?
I know, you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery.
I know you started to do a lot of, like, physical sales.
Yeah.
Etcetera.
Like, does it kinda
what or, you know, do do they merge?
Do they not?
Do they Yeah.
That does

**SPEAKER_01:**
like, chart by like, chart art become NFT art and digital art?
Or like Yeah.
I you know, I like, the NFT stuff, I do think kinda just, like, eventually fades into the background.
Like, the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance.
So, you know, you could use that for physical art.
You could use it for digital.
I think it was, like, more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kinda argue the token is the art.
You now have this, you know, more liquid asset.
So for art specifically,
yeah, it's kinda just becoming part of the market, and I think you'll see NFTs,
you know, used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art.
Like, no one's really if you like
the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and, like, collectibles in general is, like, kind of amazing.
Like, it's still like, oh, there's a sticker on the back that this you know, says it was from this gallery.
Probably it was.
Like, nobody
knows.
And so
and, also, I think, you know, like,
a lot of people are, like, really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally.
It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity,
like, that's kinda good enough.
You don't really need some complicated tech solution there.
And
it's hard to imagine a world in which, you know, like,
collectors
and, like, customers
like, you just want like, I personally have, like, a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it.
Yeah.
And I think in general, that trend continues.
So I think
digital art will kinda just become
a bigger part of the contemporary art market, and then eventually, we'll see
NFTs used as certificates of authenticity,
you know, for all,
you know, high value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist, and she often gets a request, like,
for the value that was paid for because someone wants to insure it.
Right?
And, like Yeah.
We like, there's this whole downstream
kind of economy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, it's kinda challenging, and it's almost,
almost a paradox.
But I think, you know, we've kind of always taken the, like, minimal decentralization.
So it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then,
you know, like, one example is, like, we were, like, talking about, like, token models early on.
I was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists.
And I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible
thing I could ever imagine.
You know?
It's like people voting, like, your art's terrible.
Like, you know, like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean, in the the pumped up fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.
Exact yeah.
You know, maybe we have people stream.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
It's, like, live going.
Like, is the art good or bad?
Watch this artist

**SPEAKER_00:**
threaten to commit suicide.
I I did do a stalk on a dating project once where where you basically had to be voted in based on your notes, which does seem horrible.
I can see.
Very, very evil.
You know?
Like But there's right now 10 pages.
Remember those?
Yes.
Yes.
Or hot or not or all of those Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's Yeah.
Yeah.
Just just brutal.
But I and, yeah, especially in places
you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
It's challenging and, you know, art like, good art is subjective.
So
that, you know, it's like
I feel like, you know, like, the on chain auctions, escrow on chain, that makes a lot of sense.
Like,
on chain voting for, like, which artists are good.
You know, that's kinda, like,
let people who are, like, making decisions, like, do their thing.
And then if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe, like, the token holders can, like,
you know, raise awareness.
But
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was, like, the and, like,
part of it too I mean, actually, early on, we were, like thought we would be more of an open platform.
And then as things progressed, there were more tools.
Like, you know, we were just trying it was like, we were building things, trying to add value,
and
there's a ton of open tooling.
So, like, early on, we kinda thought we might have, like, super areas, like, the ultra curated
view into the market, and then maybe you have, like, you know, another kinda, like, open platform
that's anyone

**SPEAKER_00:**
could use.
But I'm I'm curious.
Like, what was the like, what like, you know, it's a two sided market with market artists
and art buyers.
Like, what do you think like,
did you have to get the artist first to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the art first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
We
you know, you kinda had to get both first.
