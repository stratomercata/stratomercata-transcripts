**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] Okay.
[00:02] We are live, and we have a very special episode today.
[00:05] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs,
[00:08] and we're joined by special guest and very old friend,
[00:11] John Crain.
[00:12] Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:14] Hey, Victor.
[00:15] Hey, everyone.
[00:16] Hey.
[00:17] Good to see you guys.
[00:18] Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:20] John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:24] But do you wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:30] Yeah, sure.
[00:31] So yeah, let's see.
[00:33] My crypto journey started in around 2015,
[00:36] going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:41] Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:44] I worked in advertising.
[00:46] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[00:50] And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[00:59] And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art.
[01:04] So yeah, I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:07] Yeah. Remember—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:08] How you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:11] Obviously, we met there, but what was that—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:13] Yeah. Well—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:14] Your—yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:15] So I was kind of hanging—
[01:17] Okay, I was wrong.
[01:18] Like, this is actually super cool.
[01:20] I have no problem changing.
[01:22] I was like, I was totally wrong.
[01:24] This is amazing.
[01:25] And I was just googling "Ethereum blockchain hackathon."
[01:29] I was trying to find—like, get deeper involved.
[01:32] I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
[01:35] And so then I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[01:39] And I applied with Charles.
[01:41] And then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:43] Yeah. And to be clear, to let everyone know,
[01:46] we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project,
[01:49] and we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?
[01:53] We gave you the—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:54] Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Exactly.
[01:56] I think the Monday after—
[01:58] I don't know. I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:03] Yeah.
[02:04] I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:06] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:07] I remember there was like a couple-week consulting—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:09] Transition period while—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:10] You know? Yeah. I think that's true.
[02:12] Maybe it was like we started hourly, like, getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time. So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:16] So with Counterparty, you could have been on—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:18] Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:19] If only.
[02:20] So what inspired SuperRare?
[02:22] Like, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[02:28] But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:35] Yeah.
[02:36] Well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[02:38] We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
[02:43] Watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[02:46] Me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens, and I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard—like, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code.
[02:56] But the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[02:59] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
[03:05] It was incredible to see that happen.
[03:07] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
[03:13] And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
[03:15] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[03:20] So it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
[03:24] I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[03:30] So that got me into NFTs.
[03:32] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs.
[03:37] I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
[03:42] And it just seemed obvious.
[03:44] I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets,
[03:47] and this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[03:50] So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.
