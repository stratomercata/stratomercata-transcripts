**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today.
[00:02] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs.
[00:04] And we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane.
[00:06] Welcome, John Crane.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:08] Hey, Victor.
[00:10] Hey, everyone.
[00:12] Hey guys, thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:14] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of Super Rare.
[00:16] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:20] Yeah, sure.
[00:22] So, yeah, I.
[00:24] Let's see, my crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:30] Yeah, I was.
[00:32] Before that.
[00:34] My background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:36] I worked in advertising.
[00:38] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[00:42] And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[00:52] And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art, so doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:58] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:00] Remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:02] Obviously we met there, but like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:04] Yeah, well, yeah, no, so I was, I was kind of hanging out with the New York bitcoin crowd.
[01:08] Yeah, I had actually met, I think John Lilick, which I forgot, but I met him at the, like the New York Bitcoin Center.
[01:14] I don't know if you guys remember that.
[01:16] Yeah, yeah.
[01:18] So I was hanging around and actually I was like, I was super into counterparty, so I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated.
[01:24] You know, Vitalik's full of shit, it's not going to work.
[01:26] And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong.
[01:30] Like, this is actually super cool.
[01:32] I have no problem changing.
[01:34] I was like, I was totally wrong.
[01:36] This is amazing.
[01:38] And I was just like Googling Ethereum, blockchain, hackathon.
[01:42] I was like trying to find like, get deeper involved.
[01:44] I was trying to like quit my day job and go full time crypto.
[01:48] And so then I, I think I just googled it and it was like, oh, shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[01:54] And I applied with Charles and then.
[01:56] Yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:58] Yeah.
[02:00] And.
[02:02] And to be clear, you.
[02:04] To let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you, in Web three.
[02:12] Right.
[02:14] We gave you that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:16] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[02:18] Exactly.
[02:20] I think I.
[02:22] I think that like the Monday after, like, I.
[02:24] I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on block apps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:28] Yeah, well, I, we, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys.
[02:32] Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:34] There was like a couple week consulting transition period while, you know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:36] Yeah, I think that's true.
[02:38] Yeah.
[02:40] Maybe it was like we started like hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full time.
[02:46] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:48] So with counterparty you, you could have been on Christa Rose Tech.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:50] Yeah, exactly.
[02:52] If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:54] So what inspired Super Rare?
[02:56] Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[03:04] But you know, what, what triggered you to kind of create Super Rare, which is what, for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:12] Yeah, I.
[03:14] Well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[03:16] You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC20 tokens.
[03:30] And I found it was super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard is a super simple protocol, very simple code.
[03:36] But the adoption created this.
[03:38] There's massive wealth generation.
[03:40] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for, you know, humans and the economy.
[03:46] Like, it was like, incredible to see that happen.
[03:48] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC721 and like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
[03:56] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[04:00] Like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into like, NFTs and that, you know, like, I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the, you know, the, the total addressable market's probably pretty large.
[04:12] So that got me into NFTs.
[04:14] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like, you know, going to the art fairs.
[04:20] I had friends who were, you know, looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the, you know, the business of art.
[04:26] And it just seemed obvious.
[04:28] I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets.
[04:32] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[04:34] So it's kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:40] And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of like the NFT explosion?
[04:42] Because you guys, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, you know, like, how's it going?
[04:46] And you know, like no one is really paying attention.
[04:48] And all of a sudden, you know, next day everyone's talking about.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:52] It was absolutely crazy.
[04:54] It was hard.
[04:56] You like, it was just like completely surreal the whole time.
[04:58] Like it felt like a dream.
[05:00] Like we, you know, we started in 2018.
[05:02] We, we were, we tried to raise money.
[05:04] It never really worked.
[05:06] Like by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and like making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:12] So that's best situation to possibly be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:14] Yeah, it was like it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[05:18] So yeah, it was like, you know, it was a grind.
[05:20] It was super volatile.
[05:22] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[05:24] But yeah, then it just, it just really started.
[05:26] Like I remember the numbers were like doubling every month for a while.
[05:30] Like I remember it was October 2020.
[05:32] It was our first million dollar month in volume.
[05:34] And I was just like, this is wild.
[05:36] But 12 months ago we were like, all right, so the volume was like $5,000 and we made a couple hundred bucks.
[05:42] Okay.
[05:44] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:46] And were you guys the first self minting NFT platform?
[05:48] I think like we were trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:50] Yeah, we were the first to come.
[05:52] Like I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience.
[05:58] So it was like there weren't great minting tools then.
[06:00] So we started with the minting tool and then we're like, all right, I guess people need a place to start sell this.
[06:04] So we'll like, we'll build the marketplace too.
[06:06] And you know, it's partially just out of necessity because like the, the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:10] Yeah, I, I, it's, it's funny because I remember if you recall the what later became the Flow guys doing cryptokitties, they were based in Vancouver and I was like talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.
[06:20] But, and I mean you've done so much.
[06:22] One of the amazing things, it's the launch of the Rare token.
[06:24] And you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality, like what led to that and how did that go?
[06:32] What did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:34] Yeah, I mean, early on I was part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network.
[06:42] There's the fat protocol article that was super popular 2016.
[06:44] So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like?
[06:46] And can you build platforms that are more like collaborative than extractive, where it's like if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just going to extract as much metadata, you know, sell ads, you know, which is a great business.
[06:54] But partially for me, it was almost like a, you know, a thought experiment of like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads?
[06:58] And it could be like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model and then, you know, kind of it's like collective ownership via the token.
[07:04] So, yeah, you know, drink.
[07:06] Drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time.
[07:08] Still am, yeah, I guess to be.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[07:10] Did you do it like classic ICO style?
[07:12] Was there like fixed price auction?
[07:14] How did the rare get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:16] Yeah, we actually just did a huge airdrop.
[07:18] Probably one of our mistakes.
[07:20] Yeah, so we should have probably sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away.
[07:24] And yeah, I mean there's plenty of challenges to Dows are hard to manage and run, but you know, it's cool to see the current administration kind of like change tack and actually seem like they're interested in like building and pushing forward.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:32] So what do you think the biggest challenge was and what do you think?
[07:34] You know, the biggest challenge was in running a dao because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool Aid, you know, running things completely decentral.
[07:42] What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:46] Yeah, I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory.
[07:48] Like you have, you're like, you're kind of like trying to read the tea leaves.
[07:50] And then rather than just making like the bet, you're like, okay, this is the simplest, best decision.
[07:54] You're like, okay, well this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this.
[07:58] And like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment and it's obviously, you know, the position is friendlier but there's still no clear like rules.
[08:04] You know, it's like the obviously like the Gensler era of you know, enforcement, the dark ages.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:08] You know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[08:10] Gary's going to be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[08:12] Man?
[08:14] Do you think of it, the advice, do you think of it more like it should be like a representative democracy?
[08:16] Like should we be like passing bills in there?
[08:18] I think they're like, they're proposals and there's like delegation usually is the model.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:20] Yeah.
[08:22] Yes.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[08:24] It could also be like just like you got a couple leaders but the stake could call no confidence vote or something.
[08:26] Or like people like you talking too.
[08:28] I haven't tried it yet, but what's that like Metadow is trying to do that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:30] Sort of.
[08:32] Yeah, I think it kind of depends on specifically what you're doing.
[08:34] If it's something like Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not dows, but just like where it's like if small changes can have potentially catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing.
[08:42] If it's super rare, where it's like there's a low level protocol and there's application and you know, other than like the escrow contracts for auctions and things like the stakes are like fairly low.
[08:50] I do kind of like the idea of like you sort of like if you can empower like a team or a few individuals to kind of just keep going and then the token holders can say like tell people to stop versus like having to approve everything.
[08:58] Like that's a very silly, arduous process and I feel like it should be more like okay if you're, it's like veering off in the wrong direction.
[09:04] You can like there's a way to kind of like raise your voice and how influence it but like, you know, having a vote on like what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:10] I'm curious like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance like being a curated kind of platform and being open, you know, like how do you think about those two?
[09:18] Because I think one of the advantages of super rare with the curation side in art, you keep the quality very, very high and yeah, unlike you know, more marketplace type NFT platforms which just frankly puts a ton of crap like out there.
[09:28] So.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:30] Yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:32] How do you balance those two and kind of keep decentralized, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:34] Yeah, I mean it's kind of challenging and it's almost, almost a paradox.
[09:36] I think we've kind of always taken the minimal decentralization.
[09:38] So it's like have it where it's useful.
[09:40] And then one example is we were talking about token models early on.
[09:42] It was like maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists.
[09:44] And I was just like that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine.
[09:48] It's like people voting like your art's terrible.
[09:50] You're like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[09:52] I mean in the, the pump fun streamer heyday.
[09:54] I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:56] Exactly.
[09:58] Yeah, maybe.
[10:00] It's like live voting like is our good or bad?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:02] Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:04] I, I did start on a dating project once where, where you basically had to be voted in based on your looks, which seems horrible.
[10:10] Yeah, Very, very evil.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:12] You know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[10:14] Remember those?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:16] Yes, yes.
[10:18] Or hot or not or all those.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:20] Oh yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:22] It's.
[10:24] Yeah, yeah.
[10:26] Just, just brutal.
[10:28] But I.
[10:30] And yeah, especially in places, you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:34] Yeah.
[10:36] It's challenging and you know, are like good art is subjective.
[10:38] So that you know, it's like I feel like the on chain auctions, escrow on chain.
[10:42] That makes a lot of sense.
[10:44] Like on chain voting for which artists are good, that's kind of like let people who are making decisions do their thing and then if it starts to be, if things get out of hand, maybe the token holders can raise awareness.
[10:52] But.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:54] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:56] Part of it too.
[10:58] I mean actually early on we were like thought we would be more of an open platform.
[11:00] And then as things progressed there were more tools.
[11:02] Like you know, we were just trying, it was like we were building things, trying to add value and there's a ton of open tooling.
[11:08] So like early on we kind of thought we might have like super error as like the ultra curated view into the market.
[11:14] And then maybe you have like, you know, another kind of like open platform that's anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:18] But I'm, I'm curious like what was the.
[11:20] Like what like you know, it's a two sided market with market artists and art buyers.
[11:24] Like what do you think?
[11:26] Like did you have to get the artist first and convince them and how did you do that or did you have to get the art buyers?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:30] Yeah, we, you know you kind of had to get both first.
[11:32] So I mean we started like just you know, out of like it really started as just me kind of like experimenting and building and so we were like, you know, started with the minting tools I was going around like demoing, talking to people and I guess we at first kind of piqued interest of the artists.
[11:44] Like I was, you know, like we were like talking about how it would work.
[11:46] And then when we first launched though, we kind of had.
[11:48] So there's Jason Bailey, who was kind of like an early digital art advocate, big writer.
[11:52] He ran a company or runs a company called Club NFT that does like NFT art backups.
[11:56] And he hit us up and was like, hey guys, we've been talking to him.
[11:58] And he was like, I know you're getting close with your product.
[12:00] Like, I want to buy this art on Monday.
[12:02] Can we.
[12:04] Can I do it on super Rare?
[12:06] And I like looked at Charlie and I was like, dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet on Monday.
[12:10] Like, what can we.
[12:12] That was in like 36 hours that Charlie was like, yeah, probably.
[12:14] And so then we basically stayed up for 36 hours fixing bugs.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:18] I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said, we want to launch Blockchain as a service with you at DEFCON 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:22] And we were like, exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:24] Oh my God.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:26] Like that's like many parallels.
[12:28] Nothing like a good deadline to get.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:30] Yeah, exactly.
[12:32] Especially with a big, you know, major partner that, you know, can make or break you.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[12:36] Right, so yeah, just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:38] Yeah, exactly.
[12:40] That.
[12:42] That's when it gets real risky.
[12:44] We actually.
[12:46] So when we did it, there was a, there was a funny bug with the like the react stuff.
[12:50] So we were live helping.
[12:52] We were live streaming or not live streaming, but screen sharing.
[12:54] The transaction with this artist, Robbie Barat and Jason and we're literally pushing fixes.
[12:58] It was like, oh, we didn't know.
[13:00] I didn't expect that to happen.
[13:02] Like, okay, one second.
[13:04] All right, it's deployed.
[13:06] Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:08] Lots of couch clearing in.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:10] That.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:12] I, you know, like, I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally like art and NFTs.
[13:16] Like, you know, can I jump in on this?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:18] Yeah, please take a take on it.
[13:20] So in defi, we're starting to see like as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a trad fi defi merger.
[13:28] It's not all the way there yet, but it's, you know, getting to just be fi.
[13:30] Like I see the path to that happening.
[13:32] Do you think like it's.
[13:34] NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever?
[13:36] I know you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery.
[13:38] I know you started to do a lot of like physical sales.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:40] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:42] Etc.
[13:44] Like, does it kind of what.
[13:46] Or you know, do they merge?
[13:48] Do they not?
[13:50] Do they.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:52] Yeah, that does.
[13:54] Like, yeah, like trad art become NFT art and digital art or like.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:56] Yeah, I, you know, I think like the NFT stuff I do think kind of just like eventually fades into the background.
[14:00] Like the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance.
[14:04] So, you know, you could use that for physical art, you could use it for digital.
[14:08] I think it was like more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kind of argue the token is the art.
[14:12] You now have this, you know, more liquid asset.
[14:14] So for art specifically.
[14:16] Yeah, it's kind of just becoming part of the market.
[14:18] And I think you'll see NFTs, you know, used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art.
[14:22] Like no one's really, if you like the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and like collectibles in general is like kind of amazing.
[14:28] Like it's still like, oh, there's a stage sticker on the back that this says it was from this gallery.
[14:32] Probably it was, probably it was.
[14:34] Nobody knows.
[14:36] And so, and also I think, you know, like a lot of people are like really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally.
[14:42] It's like if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity, like that's kind of good enough.
[14:48] You don't really need some complicated tech solution.
[14:50] There's.
[14:52] And it's hard to imagine a world in which collectors and customers, you just want.
[14:56] I personally have a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it.
[15:00] And I think in general that trend continues.
[15:02] I think digital art will kind of just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market and then eventually we'll see NFTs used as certificates of authenticity for all high value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:10] Yeah, I mean one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist and she often gets a request for the value that was paid for it because someone wants to insure it.
[15:16] Right.
[15:18] And there's this whole downstream kind of.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:20] Yeah, it's a very high friction.
[15:22] Like the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good, depending on where your position is in the market.
[15:26] Obviously Southeast loves being the Keeper of all secrets and information.
[15:30] But I think that's clearly going to be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:32] Let me add a little on on that front.
[15:34] So I felt having been more of an NFT style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more defi.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:38] We.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:40] I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true.
[15:42] But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock liquidity in selling.
[15:46] Could be one way, but people kind of want to hold on to stuff like, I don't want to sell my eth.
[15:50] I don't want to sell my, you know, et cetera.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:52] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:54] You would know better than us at the very high end of the market.
[15:56] You know, if you get like a wealth manager, they'll.
[15:58] They might extend some credit against your Picasso.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:00] Right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:02] Or.
[16:04] But for everybody else and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that too.
[16:08] You can't really like.
[16:10] I don't know if people fire.
[16:12] Sell their art, but it tends to sit there.
[16:14] And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there.
[16:16] But the credit markets actually just make it liquid, you know, as we've, as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.
[16:22] Like, yeah, I'm surprised.
[16:24] Or we're getting into that world, but we're not.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:26] Yeah, we're seeing it.
[16:28] I feel like there's the green shoots of like, okay, here's what's possible.
[16:32] It totally makes sense.
[16:34] I think just like, you know, if you look hist.
[16:36] I think you like what it really enables is like somebody to do more complex things.
[16:40] You know, it's like where you can like all the grunt work you don't have to do.
[16:42] So now maybe it's instead of making one still image you're going to do insane world building where it's like, you can go in, you can.
[16:48] You know, like, the art's just more interactive.
[16:50] And actually, the first art we ever sold on Super Air was kind of, like, generated via, like, gans, like, adversarial networks, like, voting on outcomes.
[16:58] So I think, you know, it's inevitable it's gonna happen.
[17:00] It's kind of like, you know, digital cameras were the end of photography, and they obviously were not.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:04] Well, do you think, like, you know, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority, that proving some part was based, you know, done by a human will be valued into art or.
[17:12] Or any kind of creation going forward?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:14] Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, just like, if you, you know, it's like, it's super amazing to see, like, the rate at which content's being created.
[17:20] And, like, you know, people.
[17:22] It's like you can watch a video of, like, that person didn't actually say that, but it looks like they did.
[17:26] I think that's where you're like, nobody ever answers a random phone number.
[17:28] If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, I would literally never answer this.
[17:32] Like, I don't know who does that.
[17:34] You'd have to be, like, pretty insane.
[17:36] And so it's sort of like you've kind of certified the numbers, you know, And I think it'll end up being the same with, like, content and, like, art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't, you know, signed somehow, cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:44] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:46] Because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[17:48] Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and runes?
[17:52] Like, how.
[17:54] How is that looking?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:56] Yeah, we've done a couple projects on runes with artists, and, yeah, it's super interesting.
[18:00] You know, we're.
[18:02] Yeah, I think there's going to be art on many blockchains.
[18:04] Obviously.
[18:06] Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure, probably have the highest likelihood of it lasting.
[18:10] But, yeah, actually, people really like ordinals.
[18:12] It's funny.
[18:14] One of the sort of paradoxes, or the funny things we ran into is early on we would talk to investors, and they're like, you need to get rid of the wallet.
[18:20] It's too complicated.
[18:22] But actually, it kind of ends up being this.
[18:24] You got to know all the right terms.
[18:26] It's almost like you get the secret incantation, you get inducted into the club, and you know how it works.
[18:30] And so, like, I think people really like that.
[18:32] Ordinals are a little more complex and like harder to understand than NFTs on Ethereum, which is just.
[18:36] Yeah, sort of.
[18:38] That's a funny anecdote but yeah, they're quite popular.
[18:40]
