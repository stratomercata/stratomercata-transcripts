**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. We are live, and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by a special guest and a very old friend, John Crain. Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, sure. So, yeah, let's see. My crypto journey started around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met, at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there. Yeah. Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. And, yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were a little bit past, you know, finance and trading. And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So, yeah, I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but, like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Well, so I was kind of hanging... I was wrong. Like, this is actually super cool. Like, you know, I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing. And I was just, like, Googling "Ethereum blockchain hackathon." I was trying to find, like, get deeper involved. You know, I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto. And so then I think I just Googled it, and it was like, oh, shit. There's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied with Charles. And then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. And to be clear, just to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project, and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in Web3. Right? We gave you the...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Exactly. Yeah. I think the, like, the Monday after—I don't know. Like, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Well, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were...

**SPEAKER_02:**
I remember there was, like, a couple of week consulting transition period while...

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was, like, we started hourly, like, getting to know each other a little bit and then full-time. So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So with Counterparty, you could have been on...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So what inspired SuperRare? Like, you know, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our Head of Product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But, you know, what triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, it was super interesting. Right? You know, like, we were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office or, like, you know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there. And watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC-20 tokens. and, like, I found it was super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard. Like, you know, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code. But the adoption created this massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for, you know, humans and the economy. Like, it was incredible to see that happen.

And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all, you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata. So, like, it could be that the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs.

And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the, you know, the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of truly own digital assets, and this is obviously going to apply to digital art. So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion? Because you guys, I know for a long time you were building, and it was like, "Oh, you know, like, how's it going?" And the answer was like, "No one is really paying attention." And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It was absolutely crazy. It was hard to be like... it just was completely surreal the whole time. Like, it felt like a dream. Like, we started in 2018. We tried to raise money. It never really worked. Like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves. So that's the best situation to possibly be in. Yeah, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, "I have this really cool idea."

So, yeah, it was a grind. It was super volatile many times. I was just like, "What am I doing with my life?" But, yeah, then it just really started. I remember the numbers were, like, doubling every month for a while. I remember it was October 2020. It was our first million-dollar month in volume, and I was just like, "This is wild." Because, you know, twelve months ago, we were like, "Alright. So the volume was, like, $5,000, and we made a couple $100." Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform? I think we were trying to talk about that, actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. We came... like, I think there were maybe a couple of other minting tools, but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience. So it was like, there weren't great minting tools then. So we started with the minting tool, and then we were like, "Alright, I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll build the marketplace too." And, you know, it's partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. It's funny because I remember, if you recall, the guys who later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties. They were based in Vancouver, and I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.

But, and I mean, you've done so much. One of the amazing things is the launch of the RARE token, and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality. Like, what led to that, and how did that go? What did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, you know, early on, part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in the upside of the network. You know, like, there's the "Fat Protocol" article that was super popular, like, 2016. So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like? And can you build platforms that are more collaborative than extractive? Where it's like, if you're Meta, you're just like, "I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and sell ads," which is a great business. But partially, for me, it was almost like a thought experiment of, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be, like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kind of it's collective ownership via the token. So, yeah, I was drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Did you trust that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I still am. Yeah. I guess to be honest. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Did you do it, like, classic ICO style? Was there a fixed-price auction? How did the RARE get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. We actually just did a huge airdrop. Probably one of our mistakes. It's like, so we should've probably sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away. And yeah, I mean, there's plenty of challenges too. DAOs are hard to manage and run. But, yeah, it's cool to see the current administration kind of change tack and actually seem like they're interested in building and pushing forward.

**SPEAKER_00:**
What do you think the biggest challenge was in running a DAO? Because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool-Aid, you know, running things completely decentralized. What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory. You have, you know, you're kind of trying to read the tea leaves, and then rather than just making the bet where you're like, "Okay, well, this is the simplest, best decision," you're like, "Okay, well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this." And, like, how do we not get in trouble for trying to experiment? And it's obviously, you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear rules. You know, it's like the Gensler era of enforcement.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The dark ages. You know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Do you think of it more like the advice? Do you think of it more like it should be a representative democracy? Like, should be passing bills in there? I think they're like the proposals and there's like delegation usually is the model for it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. It could also be just like you got a couple of leaders, but the stake could call a confidence vote or something. Like, people like MetaDAO are trying to do that sort of thing. I haven't tried it yet, but looks like MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

I think it kind of depends on specifically what you're doing. You know, if it's something like... I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just, you know, where small changes can have potentially catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing. If you know it's super... where it's like, if there's a low-level protocol and there's application, and like, other than the escrow contracts for auctions and things, the stakes are fairly low. I do kind of like the idea of if you can empower a team or a few individuals to kinda just keep going, and then the token holders can tell people to stop versus having to approve everything. Like, that's a very silly, arduous process. And I feel like it should be more like, okay, if it's veering off in the wrong direction, there's a way to kind of raise your voice and influence it. But, like, having a vote on what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm curious, like, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance being a curated kind of platform and being open? You know? Like, how do you think about those two? Because I think one of the advantages of SuperRare with the curation side and art, you keep the quality very, very high. Unlike, you know, more marketplace-type NFT platforms, which just frankly puts a ton of crap out there. So how do you balance those two?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. No, it... yeah. I mean, it's kind of challenging, and it's almost a paradox. But I think, you know, we've kind of always taken the minimal decentralization approach. So it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then... you know, like, one example is, like, we were talking about token models early on. I was like, "Maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists." And I was just like, "That sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine." You know? It's like people voting, like, "Your art's terrible." Like, you know, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean, in the pump.fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time. You know, maybe we have people stream.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. It's like live going, "Is the art good or bad?" Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I did do a talk on a dating project once where you basically had to be voted in based on your notes, which does seem horrible. I can see. Very, very evil. You know? But there's right now "The 10" pages. Remember those? Or Hot or Not or all of those?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's... just brutal. But I think, especially in places... you know, the art industry can be quite vicious. Yeah. It's challenging and, you know, art—like, good art is subjective. So that, you know, it's like I feel like the on-chain auctions, escrow on-chain, that makes a lot of sense. Like, on-chain voting for which artists are good... You know, that's kinda like, let people who are making decisions do their thing. And then if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe the token holders can raise awareness.

But yeah, that was like... and part of it too, I mean, actually early on, we thought we would be more of an open platform. And then as things progressed, there were more tools. Like, you know, we were building things, trying to add value, and there's a ton of open tooling. So early on, we kinda thought we might have SuperRare as the ultra-curated view into the market, and then maybe you have another kinda open platform that anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm curious. Like, what was the... like, you know, it's a two-sided market with artists and art buyers. Did you have to get the artist first to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the art first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. We... well, you kinda had to get both first. So, I mean, we started just out of... it really started as just me kinda experimenting and building. And so we started with the minting tools. I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people. And I guess we first kinda piqued the interest of the artist. Like, we were talking about how it would work. And then when we first launched, though, we kinda had... so there's Jason Bailey, who was kinda like an early digital art advocate. He you know, big writer. He runs a company called Club NFT that does, like, NFT art backups.

And he hit us up and was like, "Hey, guys. I know you're gonna close with your products. Like, I wanna buy this art on Monday. Can I do it on SuperRare?" And I looked at Charlie, and I was like, "Dude, Jason wants to buy something on mainnet on Monday. Like, what can we do?" That was, in like, we had like thirty-six hours. Charlie was like, "Yeah. Probably."

**SPEAKER_00:**
And so then we basically stayed up for thirty-six hours, fixing bugs. And I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said we wanna launch blockchain as a service with you at Devcon 1, and we were like, "Oh my god." Like, that's like...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Exactly. There are many parallels. Yeah, exactly. Nothing like a good deadline to get, you know...

**SPEAKER_02:**
Especially with a big partner that can make or break you. Right? Just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, yeah. Exactly. That's when it gets real risky. We actually... so when we did it, there was a funny bug with the React stuff. So we're live... not live streaming, but screen sharing the transaction with this artist, Robbie Barrat, and Jason. And we're literally pushing fixes. It was like, "Oh, we didn't expect that to happen. Like, okay. One second. Like, alright. It's deployed. Just reload the page."

**SPEAKER_00:**
Lots of cache clearing in that. I remember about that. I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally, like, art and NFTs. Like, you know...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Can I jump in on this? Give a take on it. So in DeFi, we're starting to see like, as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like there was a pent-up demand for something like a TradFi, DeFi merger. It's not all the way there yet, but it's getting to just be "Fi." Like, I see the path to that happening. Do you think NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever? I know maybe you could talk about your gallery. I know you started to do a lot of physical sales, etcetera. Like, does it kinda merge? Does chart art become NFT art and digital art? Or like...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I like, the NFT stuff, I do think kinda just eventually fades into the background. Like, the real zero-to-one is cryptographically secure provenance. So, you know, you could use that for physical art. You could use it for digital. I think it was more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kinda argue the token *is* the art. You now have this more liquid asset. So for art specifically, yeah, it's kinda just becoming part of the market, and I think you'll see NFTs used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art.

Like, the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and collectibles in general is kind of amazing. Like, it's still like, "Oh, there's a sticker on the back that says it was from this gallery." Probably it was? Like, nobody knows. And also, I think a lot of people are really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally. It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity, like, that's kinda good enough. You don't really need some complicated tech solution there.

And it's hard to imagine a world in which collectors and customers... like, I personally have a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it. And I think in general, that trend continues. So I think digital art will kinda just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market, and then eventually, we'll see NFTs used as certificates of authenticity for all high-value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist, and she often gets a request for the value that was paid because someone wants to insure it. Right? And there's this whole downstream kind of economy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Insurance, appraisal, lending. Like, you can't... you need much better [data]. And so it's like... I mean, Kieran, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit. It's like, I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information. You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to your provenance information.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Let me add a little on that front. So I felt having been more of an NFT-style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more DeFi, I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true. But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock liquidity in selling could be one way, but people kinda wanna hold on to stuff. Like, I don't wanna sell my ETH. I don't wanna sell my, you know, etcetera.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I think that's painful.

**SPEAKER_03:**
You would know better than us. At the very high end of the market, if you get a wealth manager, they might extend some credit against your Picasso, right, or what have you. But for everybody else—and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that too—you can't really... like, I don't know if people fire sell their art, but it tends to sit there. And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there, but the credit markets actually just make it liquid, as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I'm surprised. We're seeing it. I feel like it's the green shoots of, okay, here's what's possible. It totally makes sense. I think just like, NFTs almost are a great... like, we've talked a lot—people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff. And to me, it's like NFTs are a beautiful, very simple digital identity for whatever. You can pack anything you want in that metadata. It's just like, pack it full of stuff. It's very simple. They're unique. They're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I mean, I love the way you talk about NFTs as certificates of authenticity because I didn't realize this... We looked into the physical art market for a while, and like, every auction at Sotheby's when they have a big piece, they have to research it effectively from scratch. Right? Like, they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. It's a very high friction... like, the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good depending on where your position is in the market. Like, obviously, [Sotheby's] loves being the keeper of all secrets and information. Okay. Cool. But I think that's clearly gonna be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Any new, or maybe... are you guys just to declare war on the auction houses, other high-end physical goods? What...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, we're focusing like... you know, we launched the gallery earlier this year, offline gallery. It's on the Bowery, right next to the New Museum. And we're showing physical, digital art, installations, projections, all sorts of different things. And yeah, I think our view... like, if you look at the models, the galleries are not doing great business-wise. The auction houses are hurting. I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Stuff is so illiquid. Right? I don't mean to interrupt. Right? It's just I think the norm is stuff sitting five years, ten years... and it's feast or famine. Like, if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions. Just wait.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Like, 2021, people were just buying Picassos on their phones online. And crazy apes. Right? They bought everything. EtherRocks. I remember when EtherRocks were like, the price is exploding, and I was like, "This is truly amazing." But yeah, I think the models have to change. And you know, just as if you think what the Internet's done as far as shopping. Right? It's like you can price compare easily on your phone in any store. Right? There's no kind of price arbitrage. You're gonna look up the price of something. You can scan something, ask ChatGPT, "What is this? How much should it cost?"

And so I think the art world has really been an insider's game of who knows who and what's the real price—like, the marketed price versus what was actually paid. And I think that's gonna slowly be unwinding, and we'll see we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent. You can see things on-chain. And I mean, I think that's part of the opportunity is, you know, as the market becomes more efficient, we'll have the best tools to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_03:**
So it sounds like even the big guys want more liquidity, but they're not willing to let go of their proprietary information advantage, I guess. Is that fair to say?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Exactly. And I think that's kind of also the paradox. It's like, you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information, but it's the classic... what's the... Innovator's Dilemma? Exactly. I was like, yeah. Tip of my tongue. Classic Innovator's Dilemma.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer, right, to their places.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. They have... I mean, you know, like, Christie's and a lot of the big—or most of the auction houses are private. So I don't know how big their businesses are, but they do have... yep. There's like, you know, people will inherit art, and it's like they don't really care necessarily, and their adviser was like, "Don't sell that. You should just take out a loan." And so they do have them.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point. Right? Like, "Oh, we'll tell you how much it's worth, and we'll loan you based on that."

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. It's very one-sided, and you can't really shop it around. It's like ultra-specialized information.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Jim, did you wanna ask a question? You look like you came off mute.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, it's a little bit of a different topic, but I'll throw it in right now anyway. What has been the effect for good or bad of AI in art on what you're doing?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, as far as the startup goes, it's been great. We're like, you know, you can... we got a little robot on our Slack you can talk to that does things for you. As far as the art market goes, I think it's also been kinda great. Like, in my mind, this is just a new tool that unlocks... you can kind of do different creative things.

**SPEAKER_02:**
You're close to encouraging it then.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Oh, yeah. We have tons of artists use AI. I mean, you know, there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and think it's the end of all creativity. But I think just if you look at history, I think what it really enables is somebody to do more complex things. You know, it's like where all the grunt work you don't have to do. So now maybe it's instead of making one still image, you're gonna do insane world-building where it's like you can go in, the art's just more interactive. And actually, the first art we ever sold on SuperRare was kinda generated via GAN. It's like adversarial networks, like voting on outcomes. So I think, you know, it's inevitable. It's gonna happen. It's kinda like digital cameras were the end of photography, and they obviously were not.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But do you think, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority, that proving some part was done by a human will be valued into our kind of, or any kind of creation going forward?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, I think yeah. Just, if you you know, it's like it's super amazing to see the rate at which content's being created and, like, people... it's like you can watch a video of, like, that person didn't actually say that, but it looks like they did. I think that's where nobody ever answers a random phone number. If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, "I literally never answer this. Like, I don't know who does that. You have to be pretty insane." And so it's sorta like, you've kinda certified the numbers you know. And I think it'll end up being the same with content and art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't signed somehow cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake. Yeah. Because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of Ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and Runes? Like, how is that looking?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. We've done a couple of projects on Runes with artists. And yeah, it's super interesting. You know, we're... yeah. I think there's gonna be art on many blockchains. Obviously, Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure probably have the highest likelihood of it lasting. But yeah, it's... actually, people really like Ordinals. It's funny. One of the sort of paradoxes or the funny things we ran into is early on, we would talk to investors, and they're like, "You need to get rid of the wallet. It's too complicated." But actually, it kinda ends up being this like, you gotta know all the right terms. It's almost like you get the secret incantation. You get inducted into the club, and you know how it works. And so like, I think people really like that Ordinals are a little more complex and harder to understand than NFTs on Ethereum, which is just... yeah. It's sort of a funny anecdote. But yeah, they're quite popular. I think they'll be around for a while.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And I mean, another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on-chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yep. Yeah. Totally.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm curious about the decision to... you know, you mentioned starting the gallery. And everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real-world stuff into the blockchain, but you're kind of doing the opposite. Like, what was the decision to start a physical gallery? And why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, just you know, it's part of how the market works. So like, in... people like getting together. And a lot of the art, it's like you can look at it on your phone, but if you see it on the huge projector, there's like a 10 by 10 CRT, like TV wall. It really looks different. So I think part of it is community building. It's a space people can show up. And then part of it's, you know, the art really does just look different. So I think as far as NFTs, you know, people are still like, "Okay. These are just nonsense JPEGs. It's EtherRocks 2.0 or whatever." And so like, it's kind of telling the story to everyone else. Because at the end of the day, it's still a demand-constrained market, and we're trying to grow the collector base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Beyond art, what do you see as the next area? Like, what are the next areas that are kind of gonna need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority? I mean, I can think of a million, but I'm just curious. From your point of view, where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, I think in general, it's luxury assets where NFTs are still more expensive to create than not having one. You know, like, you just print one out, and then the ID lives in your database. And I think the customers are gonna have to demand it. You know, like, a lot of the brokers and folks, like, they do... their kinda information advantage, and so they don't really want this to exist. But I think it just makes so much sense. It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen. And we're seeing... you know, there's people taking wine very seriously, issuing NFTs, and building secondary markets. So I think part of it's an asset that's kinda fun to speculate on, but also you do... you know, like, there's a high likelihood you might have somebody send you the NFT. So like wine, watches.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Handbags, I think, are a big one.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Handbags. Exactly. Yeah. Hermes. One of the really popular ones right now is trading cards. So they're like... you know, what people like is...

**SPEAKER_00:**
So the Courtyard is still going. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think they... yeah. They're doing great. Yeah. It's, you know, kinda like you have the speculative aspect, but also, like, if you're a serious collector, you can get real things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. Last question for you because we... unless anyone else has one.

**SPEAKER_03:**
No. No. No. We just got a quick for things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
What are you most excited about in any aspect of the blockchain space right now?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Most excited? I mean, it's like... it's obviously like we, you know, we've all been working on this for a super long time, but I do think if you look at even just like BlackRock's putting treasuries on-chain with different partners, like, moving on-chain... like, everything literally is gonna become... is moving on-chain. Like, I think it's actually finally... it used to just be a mantra people would say to help themselves feel important. But like, I think we're finally getting there. We're like, holy fuck. Like, everything is moving on-chain. Like, that's actually happening. So it's, you know, real-world assets, digital assets. I think just generally, yeah, liquidity is increasing. I think it's generally net positive for everyone. It feels actually like it's finally happening. So it's taken way longer, you know, ten years, but we're still here and we're still doing it. You know, we can make like a thumbnail like the wrong ball that's happening.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Exactly. We need the "Mission Accomplished" banner. You know? Oh my goodness, man.
