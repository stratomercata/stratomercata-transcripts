**SPEAKER_04:**
Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain. Welcome, John Crain.

"Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me."

John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, sure. So, my crypto journey started around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call there. Before that, my background was kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with consumer tech and things that were a little bit past finance and trading. So, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but what was that?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. So I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. I had actually met John Lilic, which I forgot, but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center. I don't know if you guys remember that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, we do.

**SPEAKER_06:**
So I was hanging around and actually I was super into Counterparty. So I was very much like, "Ethereum is too complicated. Vitalik's full of shit. It's not going to work." And then the network launched and I was like, "Okay, I was wrong. This is actually super cool." I have no problem changing. I was like, "I was totally wrong, this is amazing." And I was just Googling "Ethereum blockchain hacking." I was trying to find a way to get deeper involved. I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto. And so then I think I just Googled it and it was like, "Oh, there's this hackathon in two weeks." And I applied with Charles and then met you guys.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. And to be clear, to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project. And we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in Web3, right? We gave you the job on the spot.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, exactly. I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Well, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were so good.

**SPEAKER_06:**
There was a couple of weeks consulting transition period while, you know...

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, I think that's true. Maybe it was like we started hourly, getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time. So with Counterparty, you could have been on Chris DeRose's tech?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_04:**
So what inspired SuperRare? I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our Head of Product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right? We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office, or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there, and watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating. I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens. I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard, super simple protocol, very simple code. But the adoption created this massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy. It was incredible to see that happen.

And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, "Well, this is pretty crazy." If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata. So it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs and that—I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like—but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs.

And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, "Oh, there's now a way to kind of truly own digital assets." And this is obviously going to apply to digital art. So it's kind of the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_04:**
And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion? Because you guys, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, "Oh, how's it going?" And no one is really paying attention. And all of a sudden, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_06:**
It was absolutely crazy. It was hard to be like—it was just completely surreal the whole time. Like it felt like a dream. We started in 2018. We tried to raise money. It never really worked. Like by the time we raised, we were already cashflow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_04:**
That's the best situation to possibly be.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. It was much easier to raise then than when I was like, "I have this really cool idea." So it was, you know, it was a grind. It was super volatile. Many times I was just like, "What am I doing with my life?" But then it just really started. I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while. I remember it was October 2020, it was our first million dollar month in volume. And I was just like, "This is wild," because 12 months ago, the volume was like $5,000. We made a couple hundred bucks.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform? I think we're trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, we were the first to come like—I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools—but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience. There weren't great minting tools then. So we started with the minting tool and then we were like, "All right, I guess people need a place to sell this. So we'll build the marketplace too." It's partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_04:**
It's funny because I remember, if you recall, what later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties. They were based in Vancouver and I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.

I mean, you've done so much. One of the amazing things is the launch of the Rare token and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to figuring out DAO governance in reality. What led to that and how did that go? What did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. You know, early on, I was part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum: just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in the upside of the network. There's the Fat Protocol article that was super popular in like 2016. So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like? And can you build platforms that are more like collaborative than extractive? Where it's like, if you're Meta, you're just like, "I'm just going to extract as much metadata and sell ads," which is a great business. But partially for me, it was almost like a thought experiment of: is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads? And it could be like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then kind of it's collective ownership via the token. So yeah, I was drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Did you do it like classic ICO style? Was there like fixed price auction? How did the Rare get in there?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, we actually just did a huge airdrop. Probably one of our mistakes. So like we should have probably sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away. And yeah, I mean, there's plenty of challenges too. DAOs are hard to manage and run. But it's cool to see the current administration kind of change tack and actually seem like they're interested in building and pushing forward.

**SPEAKER_04:**
So what do you think the biggest challenge was in running a DAO? Because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool-Aid, running things completely decentralized. What do you think are the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory. You're kind of trying to read the tea leaves and then rather than just making the bet like, "Okay, this is the simplest best decision," you're like, "Okay, well this is not clear what this means. So maybe we should do this? And how do we not get in trouble for trying to experiment?" And it's obviously, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear rules.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, it's like the obviously like the Gensler era of enforcement, the Dark Ages. You know, Gary's going to be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, man. Do you think about the advice...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Do you think of it more like it should be like a representative democracy? Should it be like passing bills in there? I think they're like proposals and there's delegation, usually is the model.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. It can also be just like you got a couple of leaders, but the stake could call a confidence vote or something.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Or like people like Futarchy too. I haven't tried it yet, but MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. I think it kind of depends on specifically what you're doing. I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just where small changes can have potentially catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing. If it's SuperRare, where there's a low-level protocol and there's application, and other than the escrow contracts for auctions and things, the stakes are fairly low. I do kind of like the idea of if you can empower a team or a few individuals to kind of just keep going, and then the token holders can tell people to stop versus having to approve everything. Like that's a very silly, arduous process. And I feel like it should be more like, okay, if it's veering off in the wrong direction, there's a way to kind of raise your voice and influence it.

**SPEAKER_04:**
But, you know, having a vote on like what color the button should be or something is very absurd. I'm curious, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance being a curated kind of platform and being open? Because I think one of the advantages of SuperRare with the curation side in art, you keep the quality very, very high. Unlike more marketplace-type NFT platforms, which just frankly puts a ton of crap like out there. So how do you balance those two and kind of keep decentralized?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, no, it is. I mean, it's kind of challenging. It's almost a paradox. I think we've kind of always taken the minimal decentralization. So it's like you have it where it's useful. And then you're like, one example is like, we were talking about token models early on. It was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists. And I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine. You know, it's like people voting, "Your art's terrible." Like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I mean, in the pump.fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, you know, maybe we could have people streaming. Yeah, it's like live voting: is the art good or bad? Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I did put myself on a dating project once where you basically had to be voted in based on your looks, which just seems horrible.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Very, very evil.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Remember those? Hot or Not.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yes. Hot or Not. Just brutal. Especially in places, the art industry can be quite vicious. Yeah, it's challenging and good art is subjective. I feel like the on-chain auctions, escrow on-chain, that makes a lot of sense. On-chain voting for which artists are good? That's kind of like, let people who are making decisions do their thing. And then if things get out of hand, maybe the token holders can raise awareness.

But part of it too, I mean, actually early on, we thought we would be more of an open platform. And then as things progressed, there were more tools. It was like we were building things, trying to add value, and there's a ton of open tooling. So like early on, we kind of thought we might have SuperRare as the ultra-curated view into the market. And then maybe you have another kind of open platform that anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I'm curious, what was the... it's a two-sided market with artists and art buyers. Did you have to get the artist first to convince them? And how did you do that?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, you know, you kind of had to get both first. So, I mean, we started just out of... it really started as just me kind of experimenting and building. And so we started with the minting tools. I was going around demoing, talking to people. I guess we first kind of piqued the interest of the artists. We were talking about how it would work.

And then when we first launched, there's Jason Bailey, who was kind of an early digital art advocate, big writer. He runs a company called ClubNFT that does NFT art backups. And he hit us up and was like, "Hey guys, I know you're getting close with your product. I want to buy this art on Monday. Can I do it on SuperRare?"

And I looked at Charlie and I was like, "Dude, Jason wants to buy something on Mainnet on Monday." That was like 36 hours. And Charlie was like, "Yeah, probably." And so then we basically stayed up for 36 hours fixing bugs.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said we want to launch blockchain as a service with you at DevCon 1.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Exactly. Oh, my God. There are many parallels.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Nothing like a good deadline to get it done. Especially with a big partner that can make or break you, right? Just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, exactly. That's when it gets real risky. We actually, so when we did it, there was a funny bug with the React stuff. So we were like live helping... we were screen sharing the transaction with this artist Robbie Barrat and Jason. And we were literally pushing fixes. It was like, "Oh, we didn't know... I didn't expect that to happen. Like, okay, one second. All right, it's deployed. Just reload the page."

**SPEAKER_04:**
Lots of cache clearing. I remember about that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally art and NFTs. Can I jump in on this? So in DeFi, we're starting to see, as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like there was a pent-up demand for something like a TradFi/DeFi merger. It's not all the way there yet, but it's getting to just be "Fi". I see the path to that happening.

Do you think NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever? Maybe you could talk about your gallery. I know you started to do a lot of physical sales, et cetera. Does it kind of, or do they merge? Does TradArt become NFT art and digital art?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. You know, I like the NFT stuff. I do think kind of just eventually fades into the background. The real zero-to-one is cryptographically secure provenance. So, you could use that for physical art. You could use it for digital. I think it was more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kind of argue the token *is* the art. You now have this more liquid asset.

So for art specifically, yeah, it's kind of just becoming part of the market. And I think you'll see NFTs used with digital art obviously, but also with physical art. The lack of good data on provenance in the art market and collectibles in general is kind of amazing. It's still like, "Oh, there's a sticker on the back that says it was from this gallery." Probably it was? Nobody knows.

And also I think a lot of people are really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally. It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the Certificate of Authenticity, like that's kind of good enough. You don't really need some complicated tech solution there. And it's hard to imagine a world in which collectors and customers don't want that. Like, I personally have a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it. I think in general, that trend continues. So I think digital art will kind of just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market. And then eventually we'll see NFTs used as Certificates of Authenticity for all high-value objects.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist and she often gets a request for the value that was paid for it because someone wants to insure it, right? And there's this whole downstream kind of economy. Insurance, appraisal, lending, you need much better data.

**SPEAKER_06:**
I mean, Kieran, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit. I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information. You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to provenance information.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Let me add a little on that front. So I felt having been more of an NFT-style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more DeFi, I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true. But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock liquidity in selling could be one way, but people kind of want to hold on to stuff. Like I don't want to sell my ETH.

You would know better than us at the very high end of the market. If you get like a wealth manager, they might extend some credit against your Picasso. But for everybody else, and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that too, you can't really like... I don't know if people fire sell their art, but tends to sit there. And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there. But the credit markets actually just make it liquid, as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I'm surprised we're getting into that world, but we're not.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, I think we're seeing it. I feel like there's the green shoots of like, okay, here's what's possible. It totally makes sense. I think just NFTs are almost a great... you know, we talk a lot of people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff. And like to me, it's like NFTs are a beautiful, very simple digital identity for whatever. You can pack anything you want in that metadata. It's just like a packet full of stuff. It's very simple. They're unique. They're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, I mean, I love the way you talk about NFTs as Certificates of Authenticity, because I didn't realize this. We looked into the physical art market for a while and every auction at Sotheby's, when they have a big piece, they have to research it effectively from scratch, right? Like they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, it's a very high friction process. Like the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good depending on where your position is in the market. Like obviously Sotheby's loves being the keeper of all secrets and information. But I think that's clearly going to be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Any new assets or maybe are you guys, you know, just declaring war on the auction houses? Other high-end physical goods?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, I mean, we're focusing our expansion. Like we launched the gallery earlier this year, offline gallery. It's on the Bowery right next to New Museum. And we're showing physical digital art, you know, installations, projections, all sorts of different things. And yeah, I think our view—if you look at the models, the galleries are not doing great business-wise. The auction houses are hurting.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model and stuff is so illiquid, right? I don't mean to interrupt. It's just, I think the norm is stuff sitting five years, ten years, and it's feast or famine. Like if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. Just wait. Like 2021, people were just buying Picassos on their phones online.

**SPEAKER_04:**
And crazy apes right?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, everything every year. EtherRocks. I remember when EtherRocks were like the price is exploding and I was like, "This is truly amazing." But yeah, I think like the models have to change and just think what the internet's done as far as shopping, right? It's like, you can price compare easily on your phone in any stores. There's no kind of price arbitrage. You're going to look up the price of something. You can scan something, figuring you're like, "Ask ChatGPT, what is this? How much should it cost?"

And so I think the art world has really been an insider's game of who knows who and what's the real price, like the marketed price versus what was actually paid. And I think that's kind of slowly unwinding and we'll see, we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent. You can see things on-chain. And I mean, I think that's part of the opportunity. As the market becomes more efficient, we'll have the best tools to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_03:**
So it sounds like even the big guys want more liquidity but they're not willing to let go of their proprietary information advantage, I guess?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, exactly. And it's a nice... that's kind of also the paradox. It's like you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information but, you know, it's the classic Innovator's Dilemma.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Well, I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer to their places.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, they have... I mean, like they're all Christie's inside of it. Like a lot of the big, or most of the auction houses are private. So I don't know how big their businesses are, but they do have... There's people who will inherit art and they don't really care necessarily. And their advisor was like, "Don't sell that. You should just take out a loan." And they do have them.

**SPEAKER_04:**
But that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point, right? Like, "Oh, we'll tell you how much it's worth and we'll loan you based on that."

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, it's very one-sided and you can't really shop it around. It's like ultra-specialized information.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Jim, did you want to ask a question? You look like you came off mute.

**SPEAKER_JIM:**
Well, it's a little bit of a different topic, but I'll throw it in right now anyway. What has been the effect, for good or bad, of AI and art on what you're doing?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. As far as the startup goes, it's been great. We had a little robot on our Slack you can talk to that does things for you. As far as the art market goes, I think it's all—I mean, it's also been kind of great. Like in my mind, this is just a new tool that unlocks creativity. You can kind of do different creative things.

**SPEAKER_JIM:**
You're encouraging it then?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. Oh yeah. We have like tons of artists use AI. I mean, there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and think it's the end of all creativity. I think just if you look, I think what it really enables is like somebody to do more complex things. All the grunt work you don't have to do. So now maybe instead of making one still image, you're going to do insane world-building where you can go in, and the art's just more interactive.

Actually, the first art we ever sold on SuperRare was kind of generated via GANs—generative adversarial networks—like voting on outcomes. So I think, you know, it's inevitable it's going to happen. It's kind of like digital cameras were the "end of photography" and they obviously were not.

**SPEAKER_04:**
But do you think going back to the metadata and certificates of authority, that proving some part was done by a human will be valued into art or any kind of creation going forward?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. I mean, I think, yeah. It's super amazing to see the rate at which content's being created. People, it's like you can watch a video of like—that person didn't actually say that, but it looks like they did. I think that's where you're like, nobody ever answers a random phone number. If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, "I literally never answered this. I don't know who does that. You'd have to be pretty insane." And so it's sort of like you've kind of certified the numbers. And I think it'll end up being the same with content and like art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't signed somehow cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of Ordinals and Inscriptions and Stamps and Runes? How is that looking?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, we've done a couple of projects on Runes with artists and yeah, it's super interesting. Yeah, I think there's going to be art on many blockchains. Obviously, Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure probably have the highest likelihood of it lasting. But yeah, actually, people really like Ordinals. It's funny. One of the sort of paradoxes or the funny things we ran into is early on, we would talk to investors and they're like, "You need to get rid of the wallet. It's too complicated." But actually it kind of ends up being this like... you got to know all the right terms. It's almost like you get the secret incantation, you get inducted into the club and you know how it works. And so like, I think people really like that Ordinals are a little more complex and harder to understand than NFTs on Ethereum, which is just... yeah, it's sort of, that's a funny anecdote, but yeah, they're quite popular.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think they'll be around for a while. And I mean, another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on-chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, yeah, totally.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I'm curious about the decision to, you know, you mentioned starting the gallery and like everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real-world stuff into the blockchain, but you're kind of doing the opposite. Like what was the decision to start a physical gallery and why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah. I mean, just it's kind of part of how the market works. So like, you know, people like getting together and a lot of the art—you can look at it on your phone, but if you see it on the huge projector, there's a 10 by 10 CRT TV wall, um, it really looks different. So I think part of it is community building. It's a space people can show up. And then part of it's like the art really does just look different. So I think as far as NFTs, people are like, "Okay, these are just nonsense JPEGs." It's EtherRocks 2.0. And so it's kind of telling the story to everyone else. Because at the end of the day, it's still a demand-constrained market and we're trying to grow the collector base.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Beyond art, what do you see as the next area? What's the next areas that are kind of going to need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority? I mean, I can think of a million, but I'm just curious from your point of view, where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, I mean, I think in general it's luxury assets. NFTs are still more expensive to create than like not having one. You just print one out and then the ID lives in your database. But the customers are going to have to demand it because a lot of the brokers and folks, they do their information advantage, and so they don't really want this to exist. But I think it just makes so much sense. It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen. There's people taking wine very seriously, issuing NFTs and building secondary markets. I think part of it's an asset that's kind of fun to speculate on, but also you do... like there's a high likelihood you might have somebody send you the NFT. It's kind of like wine, watches... handbags I think are a big one.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Like exactly. One of the really popular ones right now is trading cards.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, they're doing great. It's, you know, kind of like you have the speculative aspect, but also if you're a serious collector, you can get real things.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Okay, last question for you, unless anyone else has one. What are you most excited about in any aspect of the blockchain space right now?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Most excited? I mean, it's obviously like, we've all been working on this for like a super long time, but I do think if you look at even just like BlackRock's putting treasuries on-chain with different partners, like art's moving on-chain... everything literally is going to become... is moving on-chain. Like, I think that's actually finally happening. It used to just be like a mantra people would say to help themselves feel important. But like, I think we're finally getting there. We're like, "Holy fuck, like everything is moving on-chain." Like that's actually happening. So it's real-world assets, digital assets.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, liquidity is increasing. I think it's generally net positive for everyone. It feels actually like it's finally happening.

**SPEAKER_06:**
Yeah, it's taken way longer, 10 years, but we're still here and we're still doing it.

**SPEAKER_04:**
We can make a thumbnail like the Ron Paul "It's Happening".

**SPEAKER_06:**
Exactly. We need the "Mission Accomplished" banner. Oh my goodness. Yeah, exactly.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Well, John, thank you for your time. And as always, we're really glad that you're doing so well. And where can people find you and learn more about all the stuff you do?

**SPEAKER_06:**
