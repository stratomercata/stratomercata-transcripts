Okay, I need to process this raw transcript and make it clean and readable while preserving all the content. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the user wants a clean transcript with all dialogue and content preserved. They mentioned not to summarize or skip anything. So I have to make sure every line is there. The output should be around the same length as the input, which is about 15,000 words. I need to check the word count later to ensure it's within 90-110% of the input.

Next, the timestamps. Each line of dialogue must have a [MM:SS] timestamp. The example shows that timestamps are in two digits for minutes and seconds, like [00:01]. I need to make sure all timestamps are in this format. Also, the user provided a list of technical terms and people's names that need to be corrected. For example, "etherium" should be "Ethereum", and "Vitalik" should be corrected if misspelled.

Looking at the raw transcript, there are several instances where technical terms are mentioned. I need to check each one against the provided list and correct any misspellings. For example, "NFTs" should be capitalized, and terms like "ERC-20" should be in the correct format.

Proper names are also listed. The user provided a list of known people, so any misspelled names should be corrected. For instance, "John Lillick" should be checked against the list to ensure the correct spelling.

Punctuation and sentence structure need fixing. The raw transcript has a lot of filler words like "um", "uh", and "you know". I should remove these when they don't affect the meaning. Also, false starts and repetitions should be cleaned up. For example, "I was— I mean I was going to say..." can be simplified to "I was going to say...".

Paragraph breaks should be added at natural conversation transitions. If the conversation moves to a new topic, a new paragraph should start. This helps in readability without altering the content.

I need to ensure that all timestamps are present and correctly formatted. The example shows that each line starts with the speaker label in bold, followed by the timestamp in [MM:SS] format. I'll have to go through each line and verify that the timestamps are correctly placed and formatted.

Also, the user emphasized not to add any new content or summaries. So I must avoid paraphrasing and stick to the original dialogue. Even if a sentence is a bit awkward, I should keep it as is unless it's a clear error.

Now, looking at the raw transcript, I notice some lines are missing timestamps. For example, the first line from SPEAKER_03 starts with "Okay, we are live, and we have a very special episode today." I need to assign a timestamp here. Since the example starts at [00:01], I'll assume the first line is at [00:00] or [00:01], but the user's example starts at [00:01], so I'll follow that.

Another thing to check is the speaker labels. The example uses **SPEAKER_XX:** with bold formatting. I need to ensure that each speaker is labeled correctly and consistently. If there are multiple speakers, their labels should be maintained throughout.

I also need to correct any technical terms. For example, "blockchain" should be capitalized as "Blockchain" if it's part of a proper noun, but in general, it's lowercase unless at the start of a sentence. Wait, the user provided a list of technical terms, so I should check each mention against that list. For instance, "blockchain" is in the list, so I need to ensure it's spelled correctly and capitalized appropriately.

Proper names like "SuperRare" should be capitalized correctly. The user mentioned that the founder is John Crane, so any misspellings of his name should be corrected.

I'll go through each line, apply the corrections, and format the timestamps correctly. I'll also check for any missing timestamps and add them based on the flow of the conversation. Since the exact timing isn't provided, I'll have to estimate the timestamps based on the length of each line, but the user's example uses [MM:SS] with two digits, so I'll follow that.

After making all the corrections, I'll verify that the word count is within the required range. If the output is significantly shorter, I might have removed too much content. I need to ensure that all dialogue is preserved, even if it means the output is slightly longer.

Finally, I'll review the entire transcript to ensure that all technical terms, proper names, and timestamps are correctly formatted and that the content is clean and readable without altering the original meaning.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:01] Okay, we are live, and we have a very special episode today.
[00:05] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane.
[00:12] Welcome, John Crane.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:15] Hey, Victor.
[00:17] Hey, everyone.
[00:19] Hey.
[00:21] Good to see you guys.
[00:23] Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:26] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:32] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:39] Yeah, sure.
[00:41] Um, so yeah, I, let's see, my crypto journey started in around 2015, uh, going to the consensus hackathon where I met, um, at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:55] Um, yeah, I was, you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[01:01] I worked in advertising.
[01:03] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad and.
[01:08] Yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were a little bit past, you know, finance and trading.
[01:22] And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art.
[01:27] So it doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[01:31] Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:36] Obviously, we met there, but what was that?
[01:39] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:42] No, so I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
[01:47] Yeah, I had actually met
[01:49] think john lillick which i forgot but i met him at the like the new york bitcoin center i don't know if you guys remember that yeah we do yeah yeah so i was hanging around and actually i was like i was super into counterparty so i was very much like ethereum's too complicated you know vitalik's full of it's not gonna work um and then the network launched and i was like okay i was wrong like this is actually super cool like you know i have no problem changing i was like
[02:23] i was totally wrong this is amazing and i was just like googling ethereum blockchain hacker i was like trying to find uh like get deeper involved you know i was trying to like quit my day job and go full-time crypto and so then i i think i just googled it and it was like oh there's this hackathon in two weeks and i applied uh with charles and then yeah met you guys

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:47] Yeah, and to be clear, to let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project.
[02:53] And we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:58] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[03:00] Exactly.
[03:02] Yeah, I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on Block Apps.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:08] Yeah, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were- Yeah, yeah.
[03:13] Exactly.
[03:15] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:17] I remember there was like a couple week consulting transition period while, uh, you know, yeah, I think that's true.
[03:24] Yeah.
[03:26] Maybe it was like, we started like hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then, um, full time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:32] Yeah.
[03:34] So with counterparty, you, you could have been on Krista Rose tech.
[03:38] Yeah, exactly.
[03:40] If only.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:43] So what inspired SuperRare?
[03:46] Like, you know, I know you when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[03:54] But what what triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:00] Yeah, I, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[04:04] You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran are hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[04:14] Cause I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens and like,
[04:20] I found it was super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard.
[04:25] It's a super simple protocol, very simple code.
[04:28] But the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[04:32] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
[04:38] It was incredible to see that happen.
[04:40] and so then i saw some of the standards conversations around erc721 and like i saw the crypto punks launch um and i was like well this is pretty crazy if you think about the consumer web it's all uh you know an image and a title tag and some metadata so like it could be that like the entire consumer web turns into like nfts and that you know like
[05:03] I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[05:10] So that got me into NFTs.
[05:12] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like going to the art fairs.
[05:19] I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
[05:24] And it's just seemed obvious.
[05:26] I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets.
[05:30] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[05:33] So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, like my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[05:39] And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of like the NFT explosion?
[05:43] Because you guys, like, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going?
[05:48] And, you know, like no one is really paying attention.
[05:51] And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:55] It was absolutely crazy.
[05:57] It was hard to be like, it was just like completely surreal the whole time.
[06:01] Like it felt like a dream.
[06:03] Like we, you know, we started in 2018.
[06:06] We, you know, we tried to raise money.
[06:09] It never really worked.
[06:11] Like by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cashflow positive and like making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[06:18] So that's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:20] Yeah.
[06:22] It was like, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[06:27] Um,
[06:29] So it was, yeah, it was like, you know, it was, it was a grind.
[06:33] It was super volatile.
[06:35] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[06:39] Um, but, uh, yeah, then it just, it just really started.
[06:43] Like, I remember the numbers were like doubling every month for a while.
[06:48] And like, I remember it was October, 2020 was our first million dollar month in volume.
[06:54] And I was just like, this is wild, you know, cuz, but.
[06:58] 12 months ago, we were like, all right.
[07:01] So the volume was like $5,000.
[07:04] We made a couple hundred bucks.
[07:06] Okay.
[07:08] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[07:10] And were you guys the first self minting NFT platform?
[07:14] I think like we're, we're trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[07:17] Yeah.
[07:19] We, yeah, we were the first to come like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but like we were the first to combine like the minting and the marketplace experience.
[07:28] So it was like, um,
[07:30] there weren't like great minting tools then.
[07:33] So we like, we started with the minting tool and then we're like, all right, I guess people need a place to sell this.
[07:39] So we'll like, we'll build the marketplace too.
[07:42] And you know, it's partially just out of necessity
[07:45] Cause like the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[07:48] Yeah, it's funny because I remember, if you recall, what later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties.
[07:54] They were based in Vancouver and I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.
[08:00] And, I mean, you've done so much
[08:03] One of the amazing things, it's the launch of the Rare token.
[08:07] And you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality.
[08:13] Like, you know, what led to that and how did that go?
[08:16] Like, you know, what did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[08:19] Yeah, I mean...
[08:21] You know, early on, I was like, part of like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where, you know, if users of the networks also participate in upside of the network, you know, like there, there's the, you know, like the, the fat protocol article, um,
[08:38] that was super popular, like 2016.
[08:40] So just like thinking about like, okay, what does monetization look like?
[08:44] And can you build platforms that are, they're more like collaborative than extractive, where it's like, if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and sell ads, which is a great business, but partially for me, it was almost like a,
[08:59] a thought experiment of like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads?
[09:03] And it could be like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model.
[09:07] And then, you know, kind of, it's like collective ownership via the token.
[09:11] Um, so yeah, I was, you know, drinking, drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[09:16] Did you do it like classic ICO style?
[09:19] Was there like fixed price auction?
[09:22] How, how did it, how did the rare get in there?

**UNKNOWN:**
[09:25] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[09:27] yeah we actually just did a huge airdrop probably one of our mistakes yeah so like we should have probably you know sold a bunch of tokens but we actually just gave them away um and yeah i mean yeah there's plenty of challenges to like you know dows are hard to manage and run um but you know it's cool to see the current administration kind of like change tack and actually seem like they're interested in like building and pushing forward um

**SPEAKER_03:**
[09:48] So what do you think the biggest challenge was in what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO?
[09:54] Because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool-Aid, you know, running things completely decentralized.
[09:59] What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:03] Yeah.
[10:05] I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory.
[10:09] Like you have, you know, like you're kind of like trying to read the tea leaves and then rather than just making like the bet, you're like, okay, well, this is the simplest, best decision.
[10:16] You're like, okay, well, this is not clear what this means.
[10:19] So maybe we should do this.
[10:21] And like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment, um,
[10:26] And it's obviously, you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear like rules.
[10:31] You know, it's like the obviously like the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement, uh, the dark, the dark ages, you know, Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:42] Isn't it?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[10:44] You know, yeah, man.
[10:46] Do you think of advice?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[10:49] Do you think of it more like it should be like a representative democracy?
[10:53] Like should it be like passing bills in there?
[10:56] I think they're like, they're proposals and there's like delegation usually is the model.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:00] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[11:02] It could also be like, just like you got a couple of leaders, but the stake could call a confidence vote or something.
[11:07] Or like people like utarchy too.
[11:09] I haven't tried it yet, but what's that?
[11:11] Like MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

**UNKNOWN:**
[11:14] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:16] I think, I think it kind of depends on like specifically what you're doing.
[11:20] You know, if it's something like, you know, I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just like, you know, where it's like if small changes can have potentially like catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing.
[11:34] If, you know, it's, you know, like super rare where it's like, if there's a, there's a low level protocol and there's application and like, you know, other than like the escrow contracts for auctions and things like the stakes are like fairly low.
[11:47] I do kind of like the idea of like you sort of like if you can empower like a team or a few individuals to kind of just keep going and then the token holders can say like tell people to stop versus like having to approve everything like that's a very silly arduous process and I feel like it should be more like okay if you're it's like veering off in the wrong direction you can like there's a way to kind of like raise your voice and have influence it but like
[12:08] you know, having a vote on like what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[12:12] I'm curious, like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance like being a curated kind of platform and being open?
[12:19] You know, like how do you think about those two?
[12:22] Because I think one of the advantages of SuperRare with the curation side in art, you keep the quality very, very high.
[12:28] and yeah um unlike you know more marketplace type nft platforms which just frankly puts a ton of crap like out there so yeah yeah how do you balance those two and kind of keep decentralized do you think yeah no it is i mean it's kind of challenging it's almost uh almost a paradox um i think

**SPEAKER_02:**
[12:43] You know, we've kind of always taken the like minimal decentralization.
[12:48] So it's like you have it where it's useful.
[12:50] And then you're like, one example is like, we were like talking about like token models early on.
[12:55] It was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists.
[12:59] And I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine.
[13:03] You know, it's like people voting, like your art's terrible.
[13:06] Like you're like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[13:09] I mean, in the pump.fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.
[13:14] Yeah, you know, maybe we could have people streaming.
[13:17] Yeah, it's like live voting, like, is the art good or bad?
[13:20] Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[13:23] I did put stuff on a dating project once where you basically had to be voted in based on your looks, which just seems horrible.
[13:29] Yeah.
[13:31] Very, very evil, you know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:34] But there's writing out a ton of pages, remember those?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[13:37] Yes, yes, or Hot or Not or all of those.
[13:40] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[13:42] It's, yeah, just brutal.
[13:44] But, yeah, especially in places, you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:48] Yeah, it's challenging and good art is subjective.
[13:51] I feel like the on-chain auctions, escrow on-chain, that makes a lot of sense.
[13:55] On-chain voting for which artists are good, that's kind of like
[13:58] let people who are, like, making decisions, like, do their thing.
[14:01] And then if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe, like, the token holders can, like, you know, raise awareness.
[14:08] But... Yeah.
[14:10] And, like, part of it, too, I mean, actually, early on, we were, like, thought we would be more of an open platform.
[14:16] And then as things progressed, there were more tools.
[14:19] Like, you know, we were just trying...
[14:21] It was, like, we were building things, trying to add value.
[14:24] And...
[14:26] there's a ton of open tooling.
[14:28] So like early on, we kind of thought we might have like super rare as like the ultra curated view into the market.
[14:34] And then maybe you have like, you know, another kind of like open platform that's anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[14:39] I'm curious, like what was the, like, what, like, you know, it's a two-sided market with market artists and art buyers.
[14:46] Like, what do you think, like,
[14:48] Did you have to get the artist first to convince them?
[14:51] And how did you do that?
[14:53] Or did you have to get the artist?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[14:56] Yeah, we, you know, you kind of had to get both first.
[15:00] So, I mean, we started, like, just, you know, out of, like, it really started as just me kind of, like, experimenting and building.
[15:07] And so we were, like, you know, started with the minting tools.
[15:10] I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people.
[15:13] And...
[15:15] I guess we, it first kind of piqued interest of the artists.
[15:18] Like I was, you know, like we were like talking about how it would work.
[15:21] And then when we, when we first launched the, we kind of had, um, so there's, uh, Jason Bailey, who was kind of like an early digital art advocate, you know, big writer.
[15:31] Um, he ran a company or runs a company called club NFT that does like NFT art backups.
[15:36] Yeah.

**UNKNOWN:**
[15:38] And.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:39] he hit us up and was like hey guys like we've been talking to him and he was like i know you're getting close with your product like i want to buy this art on monday um can we can i do it on super rare and i like looked at charlie and i was like dude jason wants to you know buy something on mainnet on monday like what can we

**SPEAKER_03:**
[15:53] that was it like 36 hours that charlie was like yeah probably and so then we basically stayed up for 36 hours uh fixing bugs and i'm getting i'm getting flashbacks to when microsoft said we want to launch blockchain as a service with you at devcon one and we were like exactly oh my god like that's like there are many parallels nothing like a good deadline to get yes exactly especially with a big you know major

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:13] uh partner that you know can make or break you right so yeah just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well yeah exactly that's when it gets real risky we actually so when we did it there was a there's a funny bug with the like the react stuff um so we were like live like helping we were like live streaming or not live streaming but like screen sharing the transaction with this artist robbie barat and jason
[16:33] And we're like literally pushing fixes.
[16:36] It was like, oh, we didn't know.
[16:38] I didn't expect that to happen.
[16:40] Like, okay, one second.
[16:42] Like, all right, it's deployed.
[16:44] Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[16:46] Lots of cash clearing.
[16:48] I remember about that.
[16:50] I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally like art and NFTs.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[16:54] Can I jump in on this?
[16:56] Yeah, please.
[16:58] Take a take on it.
[17:00] So in DeFi, we're starting to see, like as the administration has cleared the way to some extent,
[17:05] It seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a TradFi DeFi merger.
[17:10] It's not all the way there yet, but it's, you know, getting to just be five.
[17:14] Like I see the path to that happening.
[17:17] Do you think like it's NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever?
[17:21] I know, you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery.
[17:24] I know you started to do a lot of like physical sales.
[17:27] Yeah.
[17:29] Et cetera.
[17:31] Like, does it kind of, or, you know, do they merge?
[17:34] Do they not?
[17:36] Do they?
[17:38] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[17:40] Like, like trad art become NFT art and digital art or like.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[17:44] Yeah.
[17:46] I, you know, I like the NFT stuff.
[17:49] I do think kind of just like eventually fades into the background.
[17:52] Like the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance.
[17:56] So, you know, you could use that for physical art.
[17:59] You could use it for digital.
[18:01] I think it was like,
[18:03] more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kind of argue the token is the art you now have this you know more liquid asset um so for art specifically yeah it's kind of just becoming part of the market and i think you'll see nfts you know used with digital art obviously but also with physical art like no one's really if you like
[18:23] the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and collectibles in general is kind of amazing.
[18:28] It's still like, oh, there's a sticker on the back that says it was from this gallery.
[18:32] Probably it was.
[18:34] Probably it was?
[18:36] Nobody knows.
[18:38] And also I think, you know, like a lot of people are like really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally.
[18:46] It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity, like that's kind of good enough.
[18:51] You don't really need some complicated tech solution there.
[18:54] And it's hard to imagine a world in which, you know, like.
[18:58] collectors and like customers that you just want, like, I personally have like a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it.
[19:06] Yeah.
[19:08] Um, and I think in general, that trend continues.
[19:11] So I think digital art will kind of just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market.
[19:16] And then eventually we'll see NFTs used as certificates of authenticity, um, you know, for all, you know, high value objects.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[19:23] Yeah, I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist and she often gets a request for the value that was paid for it because someone wants to insure it, right?
[19:32] And there's this whole downstream kind of economy.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[19:35] Insurance, appraisal, lending, you need much better.
[19:38] And so it's like,
[19:40] I mean, Kieran, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit.
[19:44] I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information.
[19:48] You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to provenance information.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[19:52] Let me add a little on that front.
[19:54] So I felt having been more of an NFT style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more DeFi,
[19:59] I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true, but I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock
[20:05] liquidity in selling could be one way, but people kind of want to hold on to stuff.
[20:09] Like, I don't want to sell my ETH.
[20:11] I don't want to sell my, you know, et cetera.
[20:14] Yeah.
[20:16] You would know better than us.
[20:18] At the very high end of the market, you know, if you get like a wealth manager, they might extend some credit against your Picasso, right?
[20:24] But for everybody else, and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that, too.
[20:28] You can't really, like...
[20:30] I don't know if people fire sell their art, but tends to sit there.
[20:34] And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there.
[20:37] But the credit markets actually just make it liquid, you know, as we've as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.
[20:43] Like, yeah, I'm surprised we're getting into that world, but we're not.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[20:47] Yeah, I think we're seeing it.
[20:49] I feel like there's the green shoots of like, OK, here's what's possible.
[20:53] It totally makes sense.
[20:55] I think just
[20:57] Like NFTs almost, this is like, they're a great, you know, like we've talked, a lot of people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff.
[21:04] And like, to me, it's like NFTs are like a beautiful, very simple digital identity for whatever.
[21:09] You can pack anything you want in that metadata.
[21:12] It's just like a packet full of stuff.
[21:14] It's very simple.
[21:16] They're unique.
[21:18] They're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[21:21] Yeah, I mean, I love the way you talk about, you know, NFTs as certificates of authenticity, because I didn't realize this.
[21:27] We looked into like the physical art market for a while and like every auction at Sotheby's when they have a big piece, like they have to research it effectively from scratch, right?
[21:34] Like they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:39] Yeah, it's a very high friction process.
[21:42] Like the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good.
[21:46] You know, like depending on where your position is in the market, like obviously Sotheby's loves being the, you know, the keeper of all secrets and information.
[21:53] But I think that's clearly going to be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[21:57] Any new assets or maybe are you guys, you know, just to declare war on the auction houses, houses, you know,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[22:02] other high-end physical goods what uh yeah i mean we're focusing like our expansion like you know we launched the gallery earlier this year um offline gallery it's on the bowery um right next to new museum and you know we're showing physical digital art you know installations you know projections all sorts of different things and yeah i think like you know our view like
[22:22] If you look at the models, the galleries are not doing great business-wise.
[22:26] The auction houses are hurting.
[22:28] I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[22:31] Stuff is so illiquid, right?
[22:33] I don't mean to interrupt, right?
[22:35] I think the norm is stuff sitting five years, 10 years.
[22:39] It's feast or famine.
[22:41] If we print a bunch of money, probably you get a bunch of transactions.
[22:44] You just wait.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[22:47] 2021, people were just buying Picassos on their phones online.
[22:51] and crazy ape and crazy apes right so yeah everything every year like ether rocks i remember when ether rocks were like the price is exploding and i was like this is truly amazing yeah um but yeah i think like the models have to change and you know just as like if you think what the internet's done as far as like
[23:09] shopping, right?
[23:11] It's like, you can price compare easily on your phone in any stores, right?
[23:15] There's no kind of like price arbitrage.
[23:17] You're like, you're going to look up the price of something.
[23:19] You can scan something, figuring it like ask ChatGPT, what is, you know, what is this?
[23:23] How much should it cost?
[23:25] And so I think like,
[23:27] The art world has really, it has been like an insider's game of who knows who and like, what's the real price, like the marketed price versus like what was actually paid.
[23:36] And I think that's gonna like, it's kind of slowly like unwinding and we'll see, we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent.
[23:44] You can see things on chain.
[23:46] And I mean, I think that's you know, like that's kind of like part of the opportunity is as the market becomes more efficient, we'll have the best tools to to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[23:52] So it sounds like even the big guys want

**SPEAKER_02:**
[23:55] more liquidity but they're not willing to like let go of their proprietary information advantage i guess yeah yeah exactly and i but it's a nice like that's a kind of also the paradox it's like you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information but like you know it's the classic uh what's the the innovators dilemma the innovators let me exactly i was like tip my time yeah classic innovators dilemma

**SPEAKER_03:**
[24:11] Well, I, I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer.
[24:16] Right.
[24:18] To, to their places.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[24:20] Yeah, they have, um, I mean, I, like they're all Christie's inside of it.
[24:25] Like a lot of the big, or most of the auction houses are private.
[24:29] So I don't know how big their businesses are, but they do have, um, yeah.
[24:33] there's like you know people will like inherit art and it's like they don't really care necessarily and their advisor was like don't sell that you should just take out a loan and so they do have them but that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point right like like oh we'll tell you how much it's worth and we'll loan you based on that yeah it's very one-sided and you can't really shop it around it's like ultra specialized information

**SPEAKER_03:**
[24:49] Jim, did you want to ask a question?
[24:51] You look like you came off mute.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[24:54] Well, it's a little bit of a different topic, but I'll throw it in right now anyway.
[24:58] What has been the effect for good or bad of AI and art on what you're doing?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[25:02] Yeah.
[25:04] As far as the startup goes, it's been great.
[25:07] We had a little robot in our Slack you can talk to that does things for you.
[25:11] As far as the art market goes,
[25:14] I think it's all, I mean, it's also been kind of great.
[25:17] Like in my mind, this is just like, you know, it's a new tool that unlocks creative, you know, like you can kind of like do different creative things.
[25:24] You're encouraging it then.
[25:26] Yeah.
[25:28] Oh yeah.
[25:30] We have like tons of artists use AI.
[25:33] I mean, you know, there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and, you know, think it's the end of all creativity.
[25:39] I think just like, you know, if you look,
[25:41] I think like what it really enables is like somebody to do more complex things.
[25:45] You know, it's like where you can like all the grunt work you don't have to do.
[25:48] So now maybe it's instead of making one still image, you're going to do insane world building where it's like you can go in, you can, you know, like the art's just more interactive and,
[25:57] And actually the first art we ever sold on SuperRare was kind of like generated via like GANs, like adversarial networks, like voting on outcomes.
[26:05] So I think, you know, it's inevitable, it's going to happen.
[26:08] It's kind of like, you know, digital cameras were the end of photography and they obviously were not.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[26:13] Um, but do you, do you think like, you know, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority that proving some part was based, you know, done by a human will be valued into art or, or any kind of creation going forward?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[26:21] Yeah.
[26:23] I mean, I think, yeah, just like if you, you know, it's like, it's super amazing to see like the rate at which content's being created and like, you know,
[26:30] people, it's like you can watch a video of like, that person didn't actually say that, but it looks like they did.
[26:35] I think that's where you're like, nobody ever answers a random phone number.
[26:39] If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, I literally never answered this.
[26:43] Like, I don't know who does that.
[26:45] You'd have to be like pretty insane.
[26:48] It's sort of like you've kind of certified like the numbers, you know, and I think it'll end up being the same with like content and like art and stuff where it's like,
[26:56] If it isn't, you know, signed somehow cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[27:01] Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and runes?
[27:06] Like how is that looking?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[27:09] Yeah, we've done a couple projects on runes with artists.
[27:12] And yeah, it's super interesting.
[27:14] You know, we're...
[27:16] Yeah, I think there's going to be art on many blockchains.
[27:19] Obviously, Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure probably have the highest likelihood of it lasting.
[27:25] But yeah, it's actually people really like ordinals.
[27:28] It's funny.
[27:30] One of the sort of paradoxes that are like the funny things we ran into is like early on, we would talk to like investors and they're like,
[27:36] you need to get rid of the wallet.
[27:38] It's too complicated, but actually it kind of ends up being this, like, you gotta know all the right terms.
[27:43] It's almost like you get the secret incantation, you get inducted into the club and you know how it works.
[27:48] And so like, um, I think people really like that.
[27:51] Ordinals are a little more complex and like harder to understand than, uh, NFTs on Ethereum.
[27:56] Um, which is just, yeah, it's sort of, that's a funny anecdote, but, uh, yeah, they're quite popular.
[28:01] I, you know,
[28:03] I think they'll be around for a while.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:06] And I mean, another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.
[28:13] Yeah.
[28:15] Yeah, totally.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[28:17] I'm curious about the decision to, you know, you mentioned starting the gallery and like everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real world stuff into the blockchain, but you're kind of doing the opposite.
[28:25] Like what was the decision to start a physical gallery and why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:30] Yeah.
[28:32] I mean, just.
[28:34] you know it's part it's kind of part of like how you know like the the market works so like you know people like getting together and like a lot of the art you know it's like you can look at it on your phone but if you see it you know on the huge projector there's like you know a 10 by 10 uh crt like tv wall um it really looks different so i think you know part of it is like
[28:54] It's community building.
[28:56] It's a space people can show up.
[28:58] And then part of it's like, you know, like the art really does just look different.
[29:02] So I think, you know, as far as like NFT is still, you know, people are like, okay, these are just nonsense.
[29:07] JPEGs there, you know, like it's, you know, it's ether rocks 2.0 or like, and so like, it's kind of like telling the story to everyone else.
[29:14] Cause at the end of the day, it's still like, you know, it's, it's a demand constrained market and we're, you know, we're trying to grow the collector base.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[29:19] Beyond art, what do you see as like the next area?
[29:22] Like, you know, what's the next areas that are kind of going to need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority?
[29:28] I mean, I can think of a million, but I'm just curious from your point of view, where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[29:33] Yeah, I mean, I think in general it's like, you know, like luxury assets with like NFTs are still more expensive to create than like not having one, you know, like you just print one out and then the ID lives in your database.
[29:45] Yeah.
[29:47] And I think but it's going to be like
[29:49] The customers are going to have to demand it because a lot of the brokers and folks, they do their information advantage.
[29:54] And so they don't really want this to exist.
[29:56] But I think it just makes so much sense.
[29:58] It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen.
[30:01] There's people taking wine very seriously, issuing NFTs and building secondary markets.
[30:06] I think part of it's like...
[30:08] an asset that's kind of fun to speculate on but also you do you like there's you know a high likelihood you might you know have somebody send you the nft it's like kind of like wine watches um yeah handbags i think are a big one like exactly yeah yeah one of the really popular ones right now is uh trading cards so they're like
[30:28] um you know what people like is like courtyard is still going right yeah they're doing great yeah it's uh you know kind of like you have the speculative aspect but also like if you're a serious collector you can you know get get real get real things

**SPEAKER_03:**
[30:39] Okay, last question for you, because unless anyone else has one, but... No, no, no, we promise.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[30:43] Yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[30:45] What are you most excited about in any aspect of the blockchain space right now?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[30:48] Most excited?
[30:50] I mean, it's like...
[30:52] it's obviously like, we, you know, like we've all been working on this for like a super long time, but I do think like, if you look at even just like, you know, like black rocks, putting treasuries on chain with different partners, like arts moving on chain, like, like,
[31:06] everything literally is going to become is moving on chain.
[31:09] Like, I think it's like, that's actually finally, it used to just be like a mantra people would say to like, you know, help themselves feel important.
[31:16] But like, I think we're finally getting there.
[31:18] We're like, holy fuck, like, everything is moving on chain, like that's actually happening.
[31:23] So it's like, you know, real world assets, digital assets.
[31:27] I think just like,
[31:29] Yeah, liquidity is increasing.
[31:31] I think it's generally net positive for everyone.
[31:34] It feels actually like it's finally happening.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[31:37] Yeah, it's taken way longer, 10 years, but we're still here and we're still doing it.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[31:41] We can make a thumbnail like the Ron Paul that's happening.
[31:44] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[31:46] We need the mission accomplished banner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[31:49] Yeah.
[31:51] Oh my goodness.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[31:53] Yeah, exactly.
[31:55] Well, John, thank you for your time.
[31:58] And as always-
[32:00] Um, we're really glad that you're doing so well.
[32:03] And where can people find you and, um, learn more about all the stuff you do?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[32:07] Yeah.
[32:09] Uh, on X, uh, at super air, John, um, at super air.
[32:14] Uh, yeah, we're, uh,
[32:16] Yeah, you should also, there's currently a show at the gallery that's wrapping up, but we have a new, there's an X copy show December 10th.
[32:24] So if anyone's in town.
[32:26] Awesome.
[32:28] You said the manual at the gallery one more time.
[32:31] I missed it.
[32:33] Oh, yeah.
[32:35] Offline by SuperRare.
[32:37] Offline by SuperRare.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[32:40] Well, awesome.
[32:42] Thank you for joining us and take care, everyone.
[32:45] Thank you.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[32:47] Thanks for having me.
