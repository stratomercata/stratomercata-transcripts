**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] We are on.
[00:01] And welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina.
[00:05] I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato3.
[00:08] Maybe I may be looking very robotic.
[00:10] So if I am, then yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:12] C-3PO.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:13] So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off.
[00:17] Kieran, you want to go?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:19] Sure.
[00:20] I'm Kieran.
[00:21] I'm our CEO, I guess you know.
[00:23] Okay, so Strato, we have been—I guess we're hard announcing it now.
[00:27] We are the labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps.
[00:31] And I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet open source kind of foundation-given project.
[00:38] First we called that Strato Mercada because kind of Mercada was sort of a separate product, and we've kind of purposefully sunset everything else.
[00:45] So going back to the OG Strato at this time.
[00:48] So I guess I'm the Strato CEO.
[00:50] Like yeah, we're jumping in with two feet.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:52] Victory.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:53] Yeah, exactly.
[00:54] Well, I just—I was kind of soft-pedaling it, but I didn't know if you wanted to make the announcement there.
[00:58] That's cool.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:59] Well, but you said "of Strato," so it was too late.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:02] I think I've already changed it in my mind.
[01:04] So maybe it's not like...
[01:06] And thanks for that, Bob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:08] Yeah, that's it.
[01:09] OG OG.
[01:10] So Strato was, you know, unveiled at Devcon 1.
[01:13] I don't know what exact date that was.
[01:15] You know, it might be almost exactly 10 years, like right now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:18] I think it's very close to 10 years.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:20] I think it was early December, maybe a week off.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:23] No, no, I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold and it was in London.
[01:27] And I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal 31 minutes at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:31] So I will keep looking off to the side, but...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:33] Okay.
[01:34] You're our resident historian, Bob.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:36] I see a YouTube video—December 11, 2015.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:39] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:40] No, later though.
[01:41] They got released.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:42] Posted later.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:43] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:44] So, well, Bob, do you want to do a quick—who are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:47] So hi, I'm head of ecosystem.
[01:50] So yeah, joined the team this year.
[01:52] But you know, long-time friend.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:54] Yes.
[01:55] Long-time listener, first-time caller, right?
[01:57] And Jim, who are you?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:59] I am James from SDR.
[02:01] I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:04] Yes, and of Strato too, as Kieran has announced.
[02:07] So let's dive right into it.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:08] We—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:09] What were your—I don't know, maybe I did.
[02:11] I stealth announced.
[02:12] I pushed over the edge of that one, right?
[02:14] So let's dive into it.
[02:15] What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires?
[02:19] Who wants to start here?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:21] I guess I can.
[02:22] Quickly.
[02:23] Hopefully quickly.
[02:24] I know we all have a tendency to ramble.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:26] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:27] So one of my big surprises, let's say—the city itself.
[02:30] I was surprised to find that I was in Europe.
[02:33] I was expecting to be in South America.
[02:35] And I guess everyone knows this—they call it like the Paris of South America or something.
[02:39] But quite beautiful place.
[02:41] The mix of food varied from really excellent to—especially on the steak front—that is all true.
[02:46] If anyone is on the fence about the Argentinian steak, go and try it.
[02:50] You know, like medium sometimes.
[02:52] You know, service very slow.
[02:54] The city does not look that big.
[02:56] Like somehow, you know, all of the hotels near the venue were booked out.
[03:00] So I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car.
[03:03] And if there's no traffic, it was like 9 to 12 minutes away.
[03:06] But it was consistently about 25 minutes away because it's all kind of like mid-rises, like four to six or eight stories.
[03:12] And it's like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting.
[03:16] Yeah, it had like a little bit of an old-world feel.
[03:18] It's kind of narrow, but yeah, super cool.
[03:21] People are very nice.
[03:23] Maybe except for the slow service.
[03:25] Wasn't like snooty slow service, it was just slow service.
[03:28] You know, so hard to get things.
[03:30] You had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way.
[03:34] But would go back.
[03:35] Very cool place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:37] And what about DevConnect itself?
[03:39] How did you feel about the conference?
[03:41] And you know, you might want to mention like—yeah, what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:46] Well, tell you the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:50] Oh yeah.
[03:51] So as a resident historian of all things Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:54] Yeah, so it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation.
[03:58] There's actually two different conference series that run now.
[04:01] So Devcon, which was originally Developer Conference, obviously, has become not a developer conference anymore.
[04:07] I don't know when it was last a developer conference.
[04:10] Maybe Devcon 2-ish.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:12] Maybe.
[04:13] It kept getting bigger.
[04:14] Big but not huge.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:15] I'm thinking in terms of the content though, you know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:17] No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right?
[04:19] Like the more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:22] Well, I can't remember—at 2 they had Devcon and then like next to it they had like, I think it was called like World Blockchain...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:27] Yeah, I mean that one was a combined event.
[04:29] Yeah.
[04:30] I guess probably Devcon 3, probably in 2017, was the switch over where you had like a thousand people.
[04:36] So it switched from a, you know, meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on to more of a, you know, hey, here are the big talks.
[04:43] But yeah, we're on to—we have seven now.
[04:46] So, you know, Devcon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think.
[04:50] But yeah, they started doing DevConnects as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference—to be a collection of different events connecting, you know, developers and community.
[04:59] So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't.
[05:03] But it did have a different flavor to Devcon in that it was lots of little things.
[05:07] You know, lots of mini-events, many under that same banner, obviously side events as well.
[05:12] But even if you just got like a ticket for the main thing with a theme of World Fair, you know, of really bringing people from around the world to show what they're working on.
[05:21] But I didn't expect it to be as big.
[05:23] Like, I think it probably was as big as Devcon really in the numbers.
