Kiran James-Lubin:
[17.0s] Can you still hear me?
[17.8s] Let's put him back in after a try.

Victor Zhang:
[19.2s] I can.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[22.7s] Lock and load.
[24.9s] Nice.

Victor Zhang:
[25.7s] Can you guys confirm we're live on Twitter and YouTube?

Unidentified Speaker:
[29.7s] Actually, how do I join the YouTube one?
[32.3s] Okay, I see it live on my laptop.
[36.0s] Okay.
[36.2s] Can you speak?

Victor Zhang:
[37.4s] Yeah.
[38.8s] Live testing.
[39.6s] Yo, yo.
[40.4s] Making sure this works.
[42.8s] Can you hear us?
[44.7s] Hopefully there's no horrible echo like last week.

Unidentified Speaker:
[47.8s] Okay.
[48.4s] I hear it.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[49.0s] I hear you.
[49.8s] I'm going to drop that.
[50.7s] I hear some echo.
[51.9s] Okay.
[52.5s] Yeah.
[52.9s] Well, that goes from my laptop, I think.

Unidentified Speaker:
[55.2s] Cool.
[58.4s] I'm going to mute and then try the Twitter audio.

Victor Zhang:
[73.6s] Oh, can you confirm, Kim?

Unidentified Speaker:
[77.0s] It says the stream hasn't started yet since it's scheduled for broadcast at 5 on Twitter.

Victor Zhang:
[84.2s] Oh, interesting.
[87.2s] So I see a preview.
[89.7s] Yeah, let's check at 5.
[92.0s] But you can see it on YouTube, right?

Unidentified Speaker:
[96.0s] Let me load the YouTube.
[103.2s] I'm just going to mute.
[106.9s] Audio is good on YouTube and everything.

Victor Zhang:
[110.3s] OK. Let's just wait until 5 and just make sure everything comes up.
[122.8s] The tube.
[126.5s] Things can stop in the tubes.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[131.1s] I can't remember.
[132.1s] At some point in my life, I was friends with a British person who made reference to the tube, but it definitely was pronounced "tube."
[143.2s] T-H-U-B-E. Quite likely, yes.

Unidentified Speaker:
[151.9s] Great.
[152.6s] Twitter's up.
[153.5s] Audio's good.
[154.2s] And so is the visual.

Victor Zhang:
[157.6s] OK.
[158.2s] Taking you off the stage.

Unidentified Speaker:
[159.8s] Thanks.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[161.9s] So from StreamYard, are we able to see people trickling in or not really?
[169.2s] It doesn't look like it.

Victor Zhang:
[170.5s] It does not appear so.
[172.5s] So I think we can do it on YouTube, but I'm just trying to keep an eye on it in the background here.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[185.8s] Because we could see if there were comments.
[188.4s] But yeah, it doesn't seem like it's—
[193.0s] I suppose we could try to join without audio, potentially, and just see.
[201.2s] Also, so it's not a Space, right?
[202.7s] It's a Live?

Victor Zhang:
[204.2s] It is a Live on Twitter, yes.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[210.9s] I wonder, how do I—oh, I'm checking the Telegram.
[217.8s] Okay, so we already had the links on the Telegram, which I guess we should probably repost.

Victor Zhang:
[223.9s] Yeah.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[233.2s] So I can see the Live, I can see us.
[238.5s] Okay, Michael's posting it.
[242.3s] I mean, I guess we should probably start in a second.

Victor Zhang:
[247.9s] Yeah, we can wait, let's just wait a few more minutes.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[252.1s] But it's a different feel from the—so, okay, why do they have Spaces and Live?
[259.0s] It's very confusing.
[260.2s] Spaces are no video, but they're like a little more interactive.

Victor Zhang:
[263.4s] Yeah.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[263.7s] The Live is just like—you just sort of see—or the broadcast here.
[272.4s] Yes.
[273.1s] Like I'm just sort of looking back at myself.
[276.6s] And it has views on it, kind of, but that's it.
[281.3s] Okay, I see some comments.
[283.1s] Hey, Michael.
[284.7s] Hey, Strato Mercado.
[286.7s] Appreciate it.
[288.6s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Victor Zhang:
[292.5s] We are still working through our A/V issues, so...

Kiran James-Lubin:
[297.0s] It's a constant state of affairs, it seems.
[299.9s] It is.
[303.2s] Lots of learning curve in the content creator game.
[307.1s] Every startup founder—unwitting content creator. You know, we didn't want the world to be this way.
[315.6s] Actually, maybe it's better.
[316.6s] It's good to go direct to the audience in a sense.
[319.0s] Although, is it really direct to audience?
[321.5s] It's through the platform.
[322.6s] It's more direct than it could be.

Victor Zhang:
[324.6s] But exactly.
[326.3s] I mean, that the content is—
[329.2s] I mean, I do think we need to find a way to bring people in.
[334.9s] We are going to read some comments today, but we'd like to make it more interactive in the future.
[341.5s] But it does seem like X does not want to play nice with any multi-channel platform.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[349.7s] Doesn't even like links.

Victor Zhang:
[351.5s] No, it does not.
[353.4s] It definitely does not.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[356.9s] All right. I feel like let's just...

Victor Zhang:
[359.8s] Okay, I think we can get started now.
[361.6s] Let me just share my screen.
[364.1s] So thank you everyone for joining.
[366.8s] If there are any—
[369.3s] A/V audio issues.
[371.7s] If people were on last week, we were still trying to figure out our whole audio-visual setup.
[376.9s] So we are continuing that journey.
[379.0s] So if there's any problems, please let us know, post on our Telegram or on any comment that's convenient.

[386.5s] So today is a really exciting episode.
[389.6s] We are announcing the winners of our Mercado V2 trading, bridging, and testing challenge.

[397.0s] And yeah, it's been a really exciting time.
[401.0s] I am filling in for Bob Summerwill, our normal host, who is on a long-delayed digital detox as well as honeymoon.
[410.3s] So yeah, well-deserved break to you, Bob.
[412.9s] Hope you're not watching, but you catch up later.
[415.7s] And with me, I have Kiran James-Lubin, our CEO and head of—and whale on Strato Mercado testnet.
[425.9s] How's everything going with you today, Kiran?

Kiran James-Lubin:
[429.2s] You know, good.
[431.1s] I feel like shark is better than whale.

Victor Zhang:
[433.4s] Can sharks eat whales?
[437.4s] I don't know.
[439.0s] You know, like a blue whale is pretty big.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[441.1s] Maybe a little one.
[441.9s] Most whales are big, but there are some smaller whales.
[446.9s] But I think on average, whales are going to be bigger than sharks.

Victor Zhang:
[449.3s] Isn't there a whale shark?
[450.7s] Maybe you could be a little bit of both, you know.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[452.7s] Yeah, a little bit of both.

Victor Zhang:
[455.7s] So let me share my screen, because we're going to jump right into announcing the winners today.

[463.4s] So as everyone knows from the contest who has participated, first of all, we want to say thank you to everyone participating.

[471.9s] We got well over 30 participants this time, nearly doubling the amount of participants we had back in January, where we had roughly about 20.

[484.1s] So we had—and this July, thank you.
[491.0s] Back in July—time is going so fast.

[494.2s] This challenge was particularly hard because we wanted to kind of test the application and simulate real-world events.

[503.2s] So anyone that was following in the contest channel could see that there were special events that I triggered on the platform, where there were sudden price jumps.

[512.7s] There were airdrops, there were all kinds of different events that affected the flow of the contest and made different opportunities both on the downside and upside.

[523.3s] And Kiran, can you confirm with everyone—I never shared when those events were happening ahead of time.

Kiran James-Lubin:
[529.9s] It's true, yeah.
[531.4s] I even—I think Victor may have specifically punished me even though I was ineligible for the prize.
[538.7s] Like, you know, my gym hours are kind of predictable.
[544.7s] And I sense that Victor put some of them when he knew I would, like, you know, be on the treadmill or lifting some weights or something and unable to reap the profits that I normally do.

[1011.5s] And I was able to sell into that a lot in the other contest.
[1015.4s] And there just wasn't as much natural volatility this time.
[1019.1s] So, you know, most of the profit opportunities were the special events.
[1022.9s] And again,
[1024.4s] the goal was really to test all—like nearly all—the functionality that was in the app.

Kiran:
[1030.3s] Yeah.
[1030.7s] And I think one thing that led to part of the stability is in the last contest, people asked for that price to be put beside the pool price.
[1040.2s] And, you know, I think that helped—people could make better decisions.

Unknown:
[1043.1s] That's right.
[1043.5s] Yeah.
[1043.7s] It lets you know when to enter versus not.
[1046.6s] There was less like, you know, I think a lot of DeFi encourages
[1051.7s] really rapid buying behavior, you know—especially like the launchpads, you know, like pump.fun or whatever.
[1059.4s] It's just about who gets in there first.
[1062.5s] And our system is mostly not like that.
[1064.7s] So, you know, we want that spot price there just so people know if there's big divergence, there's profit to be made—and there usually shouldn't be a big divergence, you know. Good execution and so on.

Kiran:
[1077.0s] Yeah, so congratulations to Asba—I guess that's how we say it, excuse us if we're saying this wrong—who is going to win 500 USDC plus Kata Points.
[1090.7s] And we have a little bit of information from Asba on how they did it.
[1096.4s] Maybe you can react to it, Kiran.
[1097.9s] So their overall strategy was to diversify, leverage, and wait for the right moment to be aggressive.
[1104.5s] Sounds similar to what you were doing, Kiran.
[1106.9s] And then, what they said is, make sure to take advantage of all the functionality Sura Mercado has to offer—from bridging, to swapping, to borrowing and lending, to liquidity provision and liquidations.
[1120.0s] So did you do any liquidations, Kiran?

Kiran:
[1122.5s] Or were you just... You know what, I get confused by our liquidation feature because it said in the UI, like, "zero profit."
[1132.9s] And I realized later if I typed a number for the amount I liquidated in, I guess it would have... and maybe we have a max button?
[1142.5s] I can't remember if we do.
[1144.9s] Then it would have...
[1148.6s] presented a profit opportunity.
[1149.8s] So I didn't liquidate, and I didn't provide any LP tokens to the pool.
[1155.5s] So I think in the short run, probably providing liquidity—just in the timescale of the contest—
[1167.5s] the returns will be pretty small. Even if it was like 40% APR, over a week that’s less than 1%.
[1175.3s] And so things will be dominated by whichever asset goes up the most.
[1181.2s] So I think in most cases, what you want to do probably
[1185.1s] is just take the riskiest asset and hope—in like a one-week contest.
[1190.6s] In a sense, that is where I stayed mostly in ETH, except where there was an instant profit opportunity.
[1196.4s] But if you're going to use a bunch of leverage, then maybe you should
[1200.2s] diversify.
[1201.2s] So we actually have two borrowing paths in the app.
[1204.4s] So we have a CDP mint.
[1206.4s] That's how USDST gets out there.
[1208.7s] It's technically borrowed when you put collateral in.
[1211.5s] And we have a lending pool that's more like the secondary market for USDST.
[1217.7s] So the lending pool allows you to sort of spread the risk across a bunch of collateral.
[1223.8s] So if you had some collateral that's way underwater if it were by itself—that's fine, potentially, in the lending pool, whereas the CDP is a little more conservative.
[1233.8s] And so, you know, theoretically, if you're going to have a
[1239.9s] diversified portfolio and want to borrow, you might be better off using the lending pool than the CDP mechanism.
[1246.4s] It sounds like that’s what Asba did.

Kiran:
[1248.2s] Yeah.
[1249.4s] And I'm going to add something to kind of relate to what you just said.
[1252.9s] So they said they were conservative with their borrowing, but they stumbled upon an Ethereum price dip event.
[1260.8s] Since they were keeping their loans healthy, they were able to borrow more at that point and use it to conduct liquidations.

Unknown:
[1268.6s] Interesting.
[1270.6s] Yeah, so I just looped at those profit-taking times, but yes, borrowing is a good way to do liquidations.
[1278.1s] We've kept flash loans out of our system just because they're kind of a complicated, expert feature—but it's a little bit the same, right?
[1284.5s] Like, sometimes you just need—you may be in a healthy situation—but you need some liquidity to liquidate and realize those instant profits.
[1292.9s] And so, yeah, it's a good way to do it.

Kiran:
[1294.8s] And the last comment I'm going to say from Asba is: perhaps my most unique decision was to spend time in the higher-interest, lower-collateral lending pool instead of the low-fee pool—to increase leverage and have more access to capital at a given health factor while decreasing exposure to single-asset price dips.

Unknown:
[1317.6s] Yeah, I guess that's what I was saying too.
[1319.4s] So that is a reason to have—we had some debate internally on—okay, so we've got a CDP and a lending pool.
[1326.6s] They're kind of both borrowing.
[1328.4s] Do we really need them both?
[1329.6s] The answer is yes, based on... or we at least need the CDP, but the lending pool is a great convenience—easier to get in and out.
[1338.0s] You can just mint and then resupply to the lending pool.
[1341.4s] We also have the direct mint path, which was part of the contest.
[1344.5s] So you can take USDC and USDT and immediately mint USDST.
[1350.5s] We don't guarantee redemption because there's also the collateralized path.
[1355.9s] It helps maintain the peg.
[1357.6s] But I think it's good to have both.
[1359.8s] I think for convenience sake, the lending pool is more convenient.
[1364.8s] You can kind of move the collateral in and out, etc., and it provides yield back to people who mint the USDST—one way or another.

Kiran:
[1374.8s] Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good strategy to look for those profit opportunities.
[1381.1s] You know, I didn’t participate this time because I was doing those special events.
[1385.2s] But, you know, we had employees participating in addition to community participants.
[1392.0s] And I don't think that many people actually pursued that strategy of looking for high interest in the pools.
[1398.2s] So that was a good one.
[1399.5s] And well-deserved. Asba, congratulations.

[1403.4s] Let's talk about the next two prizes.
[1405.6s] So the next two prizes were sort of technical bug-finding prizes.
[1410.1s] The "Worst Exploit," which had the biggest prize—$1,500 USDC and Kata Points.
[1416.4s] And
[1418.8s] we are awarding this prize to Dada Juice for this one.
[1424.5s] No CSRF mechanism.

Unknown:
[1428.5s] Let me question that.
[1430.2s] I was pronouncing it Da-da Juice in my head.
[1432.8s] Do you think it's Day-ta?
[1433.7s] Oh, I think it's—no, you're right.

Kiran:
[1437.1s] It's D-A-T-A, like, but—did I say Data Juice?
[1444.4s] Maybe?

Unknown:
[1444.9s] Yeah, because I mean, it is...
[1447.6s] I don't know how it's pronounced.
[1448.9s] We'll have to find out.

Kiran:
[1450.9s] I think it's D-A-D-A, yes.
[1455.0s] It’s probably Dada Juice.
[1457.2s] I think you’re correct there.
[1458.8s] By the way, this was reported in the first contest.
[1462.9s] We had actually fixed it, and then there was a regression.
[1466.7s] But because it came back, we decided that—even though it was reported and we fixed it—it deserves a prize, because it is theoretically possible to cause loss of funds doing this. You could kind of do like an injection or a man-in-the-middle to steal someone else's funds during a transaction.

Unknown:
[1487.3s] Yeah, I think it's like if you're logged in already and you visit some other site that assumes that every person visiting that site is logged into Mercado, it could try to steal funds—get you to click something and get in there.
[1501.0s] Yeah, it's a good one. And we’re appreciative of finding any possible way where there might be loss of funds.

Kiran:
[1511.5s] Yeah, and, you know, calling us into account. You know, sometimes we make mistakes as we kind of build very, very quickly.
[1518.7s] I'll also mention, some people asked in the repo—in the open-source repo—where this was posted, why there were still issues from the first contest.
[1527.1s] It’s because we actually continue to do our development in a closed-source repo.
[1532.4s] But we did migrate all those bugs over there.
[1534.8s] So none of that information was lost.
[1536.9s] But
[1537.3s] it did appear that not much had changed—even though if you actually use the application, a ton had changed since.
[1545.9s] I think we closed more than 50 issues, if I recall, since July.

Unknown:
[1551.2s] Yeah, that's right.
[1552.2s] And we'll open the other one up soon enough.
[1555.7s] There are some relatively minor blockers to doing so, but we're knocking them down.

Unknown:
[1562.0s] Yeah.

Kiran:
[1562.5s] And so a little thing that—now I'll see if I can pronounce the name—the improvement prize came here: a suggestion to add a confirmation modal before actions into the liquidity pool.
[1577.7s] Currently, there's no confirmation.
[1579.4s] You just press the button and it goes.
[1581.6s] And we did get some feedback from other people that this was a bit confusing.
[1586.6s] Also, the winner of this prize is Dada Juice for another $500.
[1593.5s] So congratulations, Dada Juice, for all your contributions.
[1598.5s] This was a particularly good suggestion that we will implement before making it public.

[1607.0s] So that’s all the announcements for today.
[1610.7s] Kiran, anything you'd like to add about this contest or what's coming down the pipeline?

Unknown:
[1616.7s] Oh yeah, it's a fun one.
[1619.3s] Got to test more of the app.
[1621.8s] Interested if anyone has suggestions on contest setup in the future—
[1627.9s] we're all ears.
[1629.5s] I think the goal of these things is both to make sure the product's good—but also to entertain to some degree.

[1638.1s] We're entering into a security audit.
[1641.9s] It was actually started in parallel with the contest.
[1644.5s] So as we continue to beat on the platform and the app, we'll start to head to "live" soonish.
[1655.8s] And it will still be like,
[1659.6s] beta live—like, don’t put too many assets in the thing, we're testing all the flows.
[1666.5s] But some things you have a hard time testing without real money. You know, like transaction sizes are more realistic with real money. You want to look at pool utilizations and make sure you can actually tune the yields to things that are attractive—like, the amount of liquidity is commensurate with the trading activity and so on, or how much is borrowed, etc.
[1686.4s] You want the
[1687.6s] lending pool utilization at, you know, 80 to 90%—let’s say pretty high—so that capital is being used and returning, but not so high you can’t withdraw and so on.
[1700.2s] So, you know, it'll be realer next time.
[1704.5s] Maybe next time we'll just be real money.
[1707.5s] We'll probably, you know,
[1710.9s] keep doing contests—although once it's live, it's like all a contest, right?
[1715.5s] But, you know, just thanks to everybody out there who's helping us on this journey.
[1720.4s] Stay tuned.
[1722.2s] And yeah, hopefully—I mentioned—to just make it real, you know, we’ve got to
[1728.7s] do all of the... you know, we're trying to be really serious about both low-level security that could lead to loss of funds, but also things that are unintuitive.
[1739.9s] You know, we're trying to—
[1746.1s] I think most DeFi has pretty sharp edges.
[1750.2s] You know, it's mostly expert products—not easy to use.
[1751.9s] We're trying to make it
[1751.9s] simple, barely easy to use—consumer-protecting to some extent—but still fun for the degens out there.

Kiran:
[1761.2s] Yeah, and I will say we got some amazing feedback this time, both on the repo and privately.
[1772.1s] Just so everyone knows—we're going to be at Token2049. Kiran and I will both be at Token2049 in Singapore next week.
[1780.5s] If you're around, please ping us on Telegram.
[1782.7s] We'd love to get together with you—but we won't be having a Spaces next week.
[1787.5s] So there will be a one-week delay for our next Spaces—though we have a lot to talk about, including a short preview:
[1795.3s] Vitalik’s announcement that low-risk DeFi is the future of Ethereum—and we believe the future of blockchain projects in general.
[1805.0s] So we'll talk a little bit more about that and maybe give a recap of Token2049 at our next Spaces.
[1810.4s] Thanks to everyone that’s joining.
[1811.8s] Take care.

Unknown:
[1813.4s] The truth is out there.
