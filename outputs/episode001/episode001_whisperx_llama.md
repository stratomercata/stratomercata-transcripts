Here is the corrected transcript:**


**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:00] All righty, so we're on.
[00:01] Thanks.
[00:02] So my name is Karen James Lubin.
[00:04] I'm joined by Jim or James Hermosdiar and Victor Wong.
[00:07] We are old friends.
[00:08] We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[00:13] We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
[00:17] So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
[00:28] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened
[00:31] And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity.
[00:36] And here we are.
[00:37] So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational.
[00:44] This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts.
[00:48] I've been on a bunch of them.
[00:49] I don't think I've ever led one.
[00:50] So we're going to find out how it goes.
[00:52] All righty.
[00:53] So let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?
[00:59] I'll give my answer to start.
[01:01] And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it.
[01:03] So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011.
[01:07] So this would have been my senior year in undergrad.
[01:10] Of Bitcoin and I distinctly remember it being three dollars down from a recent peak of 14 or 15 dollars I thought it was interesting and you know looked into it a little bit I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution you know I'd
[01:24] If you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing.
[01:30] And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:35] That said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin? Aware is different than like interested in fact, like I I don't know, I was like I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it, but but I was like a little bit too above all that, like, oh, that's like a money thing, I'm not interested in that money world
[01:53] So, uh, uh, really, no, like the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine, and that, uh, um, Kieran had been following his blog, and, uh, Steve called me up, and he's like, uh, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you, you have to go look at this Ethereum thing, and so, uh, at first, I was like, uh, yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this, this, uh, uh, fake money thing, and I went and I read the white paper
[02:17] And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in.
[02:20] I was like, this isn't just about like a banking or something.
[02:23] This is about incentivization on the internet.
[02:26] And that drew me in.
[02:27] And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed.
[02:31] I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked.
[02:33] So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they, and at the time, it was a test net.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:41] Uh, and, uh, and that's when I started to understand the background of it, and got really pulled into there. So, well, I don't know, let me pass it on to Victor. Yeah, let's, uh, Jim will pick that up. I'm trying a little bit to stay chronological, so I, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like the same time frame for you, I think. We'll pull back in a question or two, right to that era. Um, and we'll talk in, in more detail, uh, but let's, let's hold on it for just a moment. Uh, Vic, do you want to take it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:04] Yeah, I think I became aware of it, um, around the same time as you. I was, I was, um, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I, I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts, and one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWIT, that was like all technical podcasts, and one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast, Security Now, which
[03:26] Went really deep into these kind of like security technical kind of things, and he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin, and I was like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like, and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client, and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin, or if I did, uh,
[03:43] I think the rewards were like 50 at the time, or something like this.
[03:46] But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice, at other Chinese startups, there'd be groups of computers in part of their office.
[03:54] And I was like, what are those for?
[03:55] And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin.
[03:57] And I was like, oh, why are you mining Bitcoin?
[03:59] And they're like, oh, well, we can
[04:01] Transfer money, and like, it's basically free internet magic money, and I was like, I, I honestly was kind of repelled by that, like, that kind of seemed like too nutty, even for me, at the time. Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:14] I never hated it. I was sort of just like not that interested, I guess. Um, you know, I think, um, you know, from the East Coast, um, the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy would long since been out in California, doing, like, IT things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:30] Yeah, you know, after your physics days, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, I guess, I didn't hate it, I just felt I was too good for it, but I think I found the, like, the, uh, money world, not that interesting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:43] Like, everyone talked about, so I was fascinated by the technical aspect, like, I said, like, you know, and it got me to read the white paper, and even, like, download the software, but I think the part that kind of turned me off about was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who are saying, a Bitcoin mining rig, they're like, they were like kind of fanatical, like, there was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[05:06] Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track, and were going to get a good postdoc, and a good assistant professorship, and all that sort of thing, mostly ignored.
[05:17] Crypto.
[05:18] Some of them weighed in on it.
[05:19] But, yeah, I think it's sort of, it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most successful, in some sense, people, at that time.
[05:27] Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math, or physics, or something.
[05:33] It's just like, the most horsepower wins, from a, you know, intellectual perspective, and I guess, the hardest working horsepower, very few of those people got interested, um, and in, uh, you know, crypto, blockchain, a few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones, um, as far as, uh, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks, like Dan Bonet, etc., but, yeah, I think,
[05:54] I don't know that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away, that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:04] Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days as
[06:07] Sketchy, because most of the use cases that, like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about, you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case, why would you use it, and people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws, like, the big one in China, that I remember, is, like, oh, I can transfer money, and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules, and stuff, and I was like, is that legal, like, no one would, you know,
[06:32] Mention anything afterwards, basically, yeah, well, I got over feeling, uh, too good for it, I'll tell you that, yeah, and we all did, yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[06:40] I want to touch on the other, the big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era is, and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple of times, was Mt.
[06:49] Gox.
[06:50] So Mt.
[06:51] Gox was that first big price run-up.
[06:53] I believe Bitcoin went from, like, 30 bucks to 1200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe.
[06:59] And, as we've seen, in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles, if you were a cynical person.
[07:06] To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price.
[07:10] And people are getting excited about price momentum.
[07:13] Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing.
[07:15] More people come in, and it goes all the way up.
[07:17] And then, seemingly, invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top, you know.
[07:23] And, whether it's outright theft, or merely collapsing asset values, or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side.
[07:30] And, sort of, crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this.
[07:35] The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound.
[07:37] But, I guess, the question is, do you guys remember Mt.
[07:41] Gox distinctly?
[07:42] I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew, who were not, quite crypto-savvy, in the industry, etc., were suddenly paying attention when Mt.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:51] Gox was happening, just getting into things, I, I, what year was it, was it 2015, 2014, 2014, probably, right? I think Docs was 13. Let me check, yeah, okay, 13. Yeah, okay, so that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time, um,
[08:06] Uh, I was new enough to it that it was still, I was observing it as a, you know, like a third-party, you know, it was, it was interesting to me, but, but, yeah, I think, I, I spent a little time to understand what, because, you know, the newspaper coverage, like, usual, was terrible about it, they didn't explain what was going on, so I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but, no, it had nothing to do with blockchain, it was, uh, it was, oh, there's,

**SPEAKER_04:**
[08:29] I think you're right, so the run-up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14, it looks like, okay, so it officially shuttered February 2014, though, and the big, the 1200 that I remember was, like, November 2013, it looks like, when did the hack happen, December, oh, I think, right here, okay, okay, yeah, right there, yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[08:49] So, yeah, interesting times for sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:51] Because I think about Mt.
[08:52] Gox, and, oh, what was,
[08:54] I'm blanking right now.
[08:55] What was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used,

**SPEAKER_03:**
[08:59] Silk Road.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:00] Silk Road, yeah.
[09:01] Like, I think it's,
[09:02] Those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right, so I remember, like, even going on to Silk Road, just to check what it was about, and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there, like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was listed there, you know.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[09:16] That's, wow, you know, I think I never did that, I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road, um, just heard about it, at, like, I had a Mt.
[09:24] Gox account, um, and some others, there was a period where, like, Dwala was doing crypto stuff, um, and then I think they stopped, um, and I believe they're still around, as, like, a payment API company, um, but, um, yeah, because I really used them, and some others.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:40] I remember the Silk Road arrests, and the Mt.
[09:42] Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was, like, the sort of, like, you know, as we've, as you mentioned, like, the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then it just keeps coming back, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:57] Yeah, it sure does, um, okay, there's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover, um, problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional, uh, world, like, if there's, if there's fraud, and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place, and if there's fraud, and it happens in traditional banking, that means that, like, it might mean that we need a little more regulation, or something, but that, that was a bad person,
[10:20] So it's always like, uh, much more tied into, you know, that the price of, of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens, but you don't see, like, e, crashing, because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere, I mean, I guess, fraud's big enough, but, yeah, I agree, um, just a segue, yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[10:37] John Coleman, SIG way, and quickly.
[10:40] Can you guys go into how you met?
[10:42] Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole, how we all do.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:46] Do I, do I want to start, or do you want to start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:48] Uh, I'll start, and, and I'll pass it over, I, uh, actually, so I had, uh, uh, back in the 90s, I was in academia, and in the aughts, I was in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups, and I was ending one of my startups, and I had, uh, two sons who were in the, our local school, in California, was a Mandarin immersion school,
[11:05] And, at this time, there was just a coincidence.
[11:07] Both my wife and I had ended jobs.
[11:09] And we said, hey, let's just be crazy, right now.
[11:11] And let's take this to its extension.
[11:13] Let's go to China,
[11:14] And actually put them in a school there, so I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC, who had just funded a startup of Victor's, in Beijing, and he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys, so, in fact, let me pass it over to you, right now, and you can,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:30] Well, yeah, and, and so the VC, um, you know, who we're still friends with, her, G, like, he kind of came up to me, and he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says, he wants to come to China, I'm not sure how serious he is, so, you know, don't put all your eggs in this basket, but then we started,
[11:45] Talking, that summer, and I was, like, seeing how serious you were about coming,
[11:48] And, and, at one point, you said, OK, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school, in Beijing, I will come, and take the job, to Beijing,
[11:56] And, I went to the school, that my kids went to, which, and said, like, you know, can you make space for, um, you know, two foreign kids, this international program, they said, yes, if you can, but the kids have to be here, the first day of school, and, first day of school, was two weeks from that conversation, so I called him up, and said, look, I can do it,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:13] You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here, on this day, and, to my shock, he actually said, yes, and he, like, talked to his house, and, like, everything, in the house, in, like, I think we had 12 days, to be in school, and we probably had to have the house back, within, like, I don't know, less than a week, so that was a crazy week,
[12:30] But, but, uh, Victor, was a great help, in, like, we were going to a country, we'd never been to before, didn't know much about, Victor, had also, uh, moved to Asia, a few years earlier, and so he had, sort of, scoped out, everything, and he knew, he knew, where the good schools were, he knew, where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out, just, tremendously, so, yeah, it was a great experience, it was an exciting time, to be in China, was right around the first Olympics, you know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:54] Like, it was, right around, that, the Beijing Olympics, and, so, it's a, really exciting time, but, yeah, you wound up, staying, for, about, 18 months, right, in total, and, um, a little less, but, yeah, it was, it was, over a year, yeah, and then, we just, kept in touch, from there, like, we, loved working together, yeah, it was great, what year, did you arrive, um, what was this, rough time, yeah, who are you asking, because it was different, uh, you, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:19] Oh, 2011, 2011, summer, we're driving, all over the country, 2011, September, August, I can't remember, we were, we were, in Beijing, gotcha, gotcha, very cool, and, so, then, you're, back, end of 2012, or early 2013, something like that, yeah, we were, back, in the country, in 2013, but, like, January.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[13:38] Let me, I'll segue, I'll try to keep it, slightly chronological, to keep everything, in my mind, here, consistent.
[13:43] So, I was, in grad school, at Berkeley, between 2012, and, really, 2015.
[13:49] I got to start working on Ethereum, kind of, purely by accident.
[13:53] Maybe, not, purely by accident, but, basically, the,
[13:56] I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm going to say, spring 2014, or, maybe, May, April, or May, 2014.
[14:03] So, for those, who have not aware, of how a PhD program works, qualifying exam, is, like, one of the last things, you need to do, before you just do the research, and produce the thesis.
[14:12] So, sometimes, it's a coursework requirement.
[14:14] Sometimes, you need to, you know, translate a work, from, like, an academic work, from one language, to, to another, to show proficiency.
[14:21] I think, most of them, have dropped those requirements, at this point.
[14:24] And, so, you know, it's a, whole bunch, of study, tense prep, at Berkeley.
[14:29] It's a, three-hour, oral exam, with a couple of people, from your department, and one, from an external department.
[14:36] And, then, they give you, a pass, or not.
[14:38] I got a pass.
[14:39] Thankfully, it was a,
[14:40] I don't know, that it was, it was, everyone feels bad, after their qualifying exam, except the people, who are really good, right, like, and, you know, so, while I passed it, I, it was, like, you know, didn't feel great, the, at least, the rest of that day, um, but, when do you find out, the result, like, immediately, oh, you do, okay, you put, you, in the hall, and they tell you,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:59] Yeah, okay, that's good, so, you're just, like, very nervous, I don't know, what it was, like, for you, but, for me, it was, just, like, three guys, I knew, and, I, was nervous, too, but, it wasn't, like, they had to go, and, like, uh, you know, like, calculate numbers, or something, they just, kind of, come out, and they're, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, it was, no, it was, like, that, right, yeah, it's, it's, a, oral, it's,

**SPEAKER_04:**
[15:20] Subjective, in a sense, but, you know, there, you've got, like, several, of the world's, foremost experts, you know, in some subjects, so, they're able to assess, whether you understand it, enough, or not, to proceed, with research, um, so, anyway, so,
[15:33] The qualifying exam, led to, I needed a short break, from math.
[15:37] I was, in mathematical physics.
[15:39] And, I had, almost, taken a job, working, for a data science company, that was taking, I, can't quite remember, something, having to do with Nielsen TV ratings, and doing something, with the data, and maybe selling it back, to networks.
[15:51] I, can't remember, at this time.
[15:52] But, it seemed, like, an okay thing.
[15:54] I, also, wanted to go back, to New York, for the summer.
[15:57] I'm, from New York.
[15:58] And, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time, to adapt, to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it.
[16:04] I'm, prone, sometimes, to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it, there.
[16:08] Yes, Jim's there.
[16:09] I'm, in the state of New York, at the moment.
[16:11] But, yeah, but, I, you know, I, need a little break, basically, and, it ended up, um, being possible, to work, on the Ethereum project, um, so, somehow, um, my, you know, I, guess, I'll go into this, somehow, uh, my, dad, Joe Lubin, got attached, to the project, basically, because he was always, he was tracking Bitcoin, blockchain, for a long time, um, he had a,
[16:34] CS background, plus, the financial background, and ran a hedge fund, for a number of years.
[16:40] And, so, it's just, kind of, always, watching, technological innovations, in financial services.
[16:45] And, I, guess, he, happened to, just be visiting, our families.
[16:48] He's, from Toronto.
[16:49] A lot of blockchain people, in Toronto, for one reason, or another.
[16:52] And, he, went, I believe, to, it might have been, a Bitcoin meetup, at that time, or it might have been, the first Ethereum meetup.
[16:59] But, this would have been, January, February, 2014, I believe.
[17:03] And, Vitalik, was speaking, there.
[17:05] And, like, everyone, around that time, where,
[17:08] You see Vitalik, speak, about something,
[17:10] You, got, really excited, right?
[17:12] And, so, he, actually, got, ready, to start, helping, out, the project, right away.
[17:16] He, actually, thought, for a time, that he might be, a software developer, for the project.
[17:20] And, it didn't turn out, that way.
[17:22] We, can go into it, a little bit later.
[17:24] But, he, started, working, on it, again, let's say, February, March,
[17:29] Um, 2014, and, so, he, just, sent me, the white paper, like, right after, maybe, right before, my qualifying exam, I got a chance, to read it, um, and, it was, pretty cool, and interesting, and new, and, that was, sort of, the first time, I grasped, the potential, of technology, and, it caused me, to go back, and read, the Bitcoin white paper, etc., and, it was, sort of, exciting, enough, to work, on, for that summer, basically, so, that's, how I got into it, um,
[17:53] And, subsequently, Jim, alluded to this, earlier, I started, to work, with the project, and, reached out, to Steve Hsu, a great friend, of ours, kind of, I don't know, not quite, famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous,
[18:05] Uh, super cool guy, uh, and, I've been, a long-time reader, of Steve's blog, he's, one of the, um, few, really excellent, uh, kind of, general communicators, who's, a super technical guy, but, most people, who are really technical, in communication, have a hard time,
[18:20] I don't, distilling it, for, at least, kind of, a mass market audience.
[18:23] Uh, but, Steve, is, actually, good, at that.
[18:25] Uh, but, with nuanced coverage, of technical topics, so, anyway, um, caught up, with Steve, um, and, that takes us, to, um,
[18:33] Steve, forwarding, on the Ethereum white paper, to Jim.
[18:36] And, I believe, the first time, I spoke, to Steve, I was, in New York, but, was, just, about to go back, to the Bay Area.
[18:42] So, that takes us, to, maybe, June, July, 2014.
[18:46] And, maybe, I came back, in August, or something, like that.
[18:49] And, it turned out, that Jim, was, there, in Hayward, and, we got, to meet up.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:54] What do you, really think, August, 2014, September, something, like that, oh, it was, around, then, because, uh, um, also, ironically, I was, driving, across the country, that summer, too, and, uh, it was, right, after, I came back, that's, all, your big life changes, are related, to some, cross-country, you do, a soul searching, you do, a literal search, well, see, I was, in Montana, and, then, I was, back, in the Bay Area, and, then, we talked.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[19:14] Yeah, okay, that's cool, how was Montana, by the way, wow, maybe, we shouldn't go, yeah, um, Montana, oddly, crypto-friendly, yeah, yeah, makes sense, big sky country, right, yeah, that's, my country, um, okay, so, let me see, here, I want, to, um, I have, a couple, other, 2014, anecdotes, that, uh, you guys, may not, even know, that much, about, but, maybe, we should jump ahead,
[19:34] To 2015, and, go back, so, just, before, we go past, 2014, so, I moved, back, from China, um, in 2014, and, so, you know, me, and Jim, were, talking, about, like, oh, now, that we were, I was, back,
[19:46] What kind of project, could we do, together, so, while, you had started, that conversation, me, and Jim, were, like, thinking, about, okay, you know, like, maybe, we could work, on the startup, together, and, at some point, you forwarded, me, the paper, as well, so, like, I think, once, so, that's, kind of, how I got into it, as well, um.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[20:01] I want, to give, yeah, I don't want, to speak, the whole time, but, I have, some info, here, that, I forget, if I told, you guys, at length,
[20:07] Okay, go for it.
[20:08] In 2014, so, basically, I did work, on the Ethereum project, through, a bunch, of 2014, projects.
[20:14] As far as tech projects go, it was, much more, global, a little more European, but, you had Canada, you had, a bunch, of people, in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit, in Israel, in the early days.
[20:24] We worked, out of an office, my dad, and I, and,
[20:27] Guy, named Stephen Narayoff, who is, now, kind of, famous,
[20:31] Actually, if you Google, the name, it's, definitely, an interesting, and colorful story, that, I'll go into, a little bit,
[20:37] And, a guy, named Jonathan, whose last name, I couldn't find, when I was writing, this down,
[20:42] But, Jonathan's, a good guy,
[20:43] And, I don't know, if they parted ways, at some point, or how that all happened,
[20:46] So, we're working, in this office, in,
[20:48] Times Square, and, you know, really trying, to find, kind of, different ways, to advance, the project, meeting, with lots, of people, um, so, you know, that's, when I met, um, Steve Hsu, who introduced, me to Jim, basically, just, kind of, calling, up, whoever, might be interested, but, part of the plans, that the Ethereum folks, had, was, you know, they had, the, they acknowledged, that,
[21:06] There would be, a need, for kind of, ongoing, pure research, and, then, in addition, to more, like, focused, R&D,
[21:13] To, to build, the network, out,
[21:15] And, so, Vitalik, at some point, pended, article, about, you know, 10 hard problems, in cryptocurrency, or, or something, of that nature, in which, and, I think, it was,
[21:25] If we went back, now, it would look, both, very insightful, and, a little bit, dated,
[21:30] I'm sure, some of them, have been solved, and, some of them, may not need, to be solved, because, something, else, emerged,
[21:36] Basically, foresaw, that they, the, the need, for, uh, privacy, above and beyond, pseudonymity, for instance, yeah, or, and, you know, many things, with that, transition, from proof of work, to, mistake, or, just, like, energy-efficient blockchains, which, people, were talking, about, at that time, but, um,
[21:52] My position, in academia, at that time, seemed, to be helpful, as the blockchain people, were, just, so different, from the academia people, despite, both, of them, being, really smart groups, of people,
[22:03] Blockchain people, were, not worried, about doing things, through, the proper channels, and approval, and writing, it up, the right way, and all that sort of thing,
[22:11] Whereas, something, about academia, makes you,
[22:13] Fearful, of being wrong, um, because, you,
