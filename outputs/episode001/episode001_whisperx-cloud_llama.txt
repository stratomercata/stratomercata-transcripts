Here is the corrected transcript:


**SPEAKER_05:**
My name is Karen James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James Hermosdiar and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened
And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes.
All righty. So let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad.
Of Bitcoin, and I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.
If you ask me, then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.


**SPEAKER_02:**
That said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin? Aware is different than like interested in fact like I I don't know I was like I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it, but but I was like a little bit too above all that like oh, that's like a money thing, I'm not interested in that money world
So, uh, really no like the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was a, uh, an old friend of mine, and that, uh, Kieran had been following his blog, and, uh, Steve called me up, and he's like, uh, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you, you have to go look at this Ethereum thing, and so, uh, at first, I was like, uh, yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this, this, uh, fake money thing, and I went and I read the white paper
And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about like a banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet. And that drew me in. And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they, and at the time, it was a test net.


**SPEAKER_05:**
Uh, and, uh, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, well, I don't know, let me pass it on to Victor. Yeah, let's, uh, Jim will pick that up. I'm trying a little bit to stay chronological, so I, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like the same time frame for you, I think we'll pull back in a question or two, right to that era. Um, and we'll talk in more detail, uh, but let's, let's hold on it for just a moment, uh, Vic, do you want to take it?


**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I think I became aware of it, um, around the same time as you. I was, I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I, I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts, and one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWIT, that was like all technical podcasts, and one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast, Security Now, which
Went really deep into these kind of like security technical kind of things, and he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin, and I was like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like, and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin, or if I did, uh, I think the rewards were like 50 at the time, or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be groups of computers in part of their office, and I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, we can...
Transfer money, and, like, it's basically free internet magic money, and I was like, I, I, honestly, was kind of repelled by that, like, that kind of seemed like too nutty, even for me, at the time.


**SPEAKER_05:**
I never hated it. I was sort of just like not that interested, I guess, um, you know, I think, um, you know, from the East Coast, um, the attitude towards like stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy would long since been out in California, doing, like, a physics day, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, I guess, I didn't hate it, I just felt I was too good for it, but I think I found the, like, the...
Like, everyone talked about, so I was fascinated, the technical aspect, like I said, like, you know, and it got me to read the white paper, and even, like, download the software, but I think the part that kind of turned me off about was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who are saying, a Bitcoin mining rig, they're like, they were like kind of fanatical, like, there was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.


**SPEAKER_05:**
Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track, and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship, and all that sort of thing, mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it, but, yeah, I think it's sort of, it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most successful, in some sense, people at that time. Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics, or something, it's just like, the most horsepower wins, from a, you know, intellectual perspective, and I guess the hardest working horsepower, very few of those people got interested, um, and, in, you know, crypto, blockchain, a few cryptographers, certainly, did, and probably, actually, more established ones, um, as far as, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Bonet, etc., but, yeah, I think...
I don't know that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess. Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days as...


**SPEAKER_00:**
Sketchy, because most of the use cases that, like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask, like, what's the use case, why would you use it, and people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws, like, the big one in China, that I remember, is, like, oh, I can transfer money, and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules, and stuff, and I was like, is that legal, like, no, one would, you know...


**SPEAKER_02:**
Mention anything afterwards, basically, yeah, well, I got over feeling, uh, too good for it, I'll tell you that, yeah, and we all did, yeah.


**SPEAKER_05:**
I want to touch on the other, the big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era is, and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple of times, was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run-up. I believe Bitcoin went from, like, 30 bucks to 1200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe.
And, as we've seen, in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles, if you were a cynical person. So, somebody said, consumer interest tracks with the price. And people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in, and it goes all the way up. And then, seemingly, invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top, you know.
And, whether it's outright theft, or merely collapsing asset values, or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side. And, sort of, crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound. But, I guess, the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew, who were not...


**SPEAKER_02:**
Quite crypto-savvy, in the industry, et cetera, were suddenly paying attention when Mt. Gox was happening, just getting into things. I, I, what year was it, was it 2015, 2014, 2014, probably, right? I think Docs was 13. Let me check, yeah, okay, 13. Yeah, okay, so that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
Uh, and, uh, and that's when I started to understand the background of it, and got really pulled into there, so, well, I don't know, let me pass it on to Victor. Yeah, let's, uh, Jim will pick that up. I'm trying a little bit to stay chronological, so I, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like the same time frame for you, I think we'll pull back in a question or two, right to that era, um, and we'll talk in more detail, uh, but let's, let's hold on it for just a moment, uh, Vic, do you want to take it?

**SPEAKER_05:**
I think you're right, so the run-up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14, it looks like. Or, okay, so it officially shuttered February 2014. Though, and the big, the 1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like. When did the hack happen? December. Oh, I think right here, okay, yeah.


**SPEAKER_00:**
So, yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think about Mt. Gox, and, oh, what was... I'm blanking right now. What was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used... Silk Road. Silk Road, yeah. Like, I think it's...
Those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right? So I remember, like, even going on to Silk Road, just to check what it was about, and I was like, you know, really shocked with what I saw listed there, like, lots of illicit stuff was listed there, you know.


**SPEAKER_05:**
That's, wow, you know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road, um, just heard about it, at, like, I had a Mt. Gox account, um, and some others. There was a period where, like, Dwala was doing crypto stuff, um, and then I think they stopped, um, and I believe they're still around as, like, a payment API company, um, but, um, yeah, because I definitely used them, and some others.


**SPEAKER_00:**
I remember the Silk Road arrests, and the Mt. Gox hacks, came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was like the sort of, like, you know, as we've, as you mentioned, like the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then it just keeps coming back, right?


**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, it sure does. There's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there's fraud, and it happens on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud, and it happens in traditional banking, it might mean that we need a little more regulation, or something, but that was a bad person.
So, it's always like, uh, much more tied into, you know, that the price of, of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens, but you don't see, like, e crashing, because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere, I mean, I guess, fraud's big enough, but, yeah, I agreed, um, just a segue, yeah.


**SPEAKER_05:**
Segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met, because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole, how we all, yeah, Jim, do you want to start, or do you want to start?


**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh, I'll start, and I'll pass it over. I, uh, actually, so I had, uh, uh, back in the nineties, I was in academia, and, uh, in the aughts, I was, uh, in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups, and I was ending one of my startups, and I had, uh, two sons who were in the, our local school in California, was a Mandarin immersion school.
And at this time, there was just a coincidence. Both my wife and I had ended jobs, and we said, hey, let's just be crazy, right now. And let's take this to its extension. Let's go to China, and actually put them in a school there, so I called around some various friends, and, uh, one of the friends I called was a VC, who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing, and, uh, he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys, so, in fact, let me pass it over to you, right now, and you can...


**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, yeah, and so the VC, you know, who we're still friends with, like, he kind of came up to me, and he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So, don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started talking, that summer, and you weren't, like, traveling in the country, so you were, like, in a different place, every, another advantage of us both, uh, uh, being jobless at the time, is that we got in a car, and started just driving around the country, and, and, I remember, like, we were, kind of, talking over the summer, and I was, like, seeing how serious you were about coming, and, at one point, you said, okay, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come, and take the job, to Beijing...


**SPEAKER_02:**
You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here, on this day, and, to my shock, he actually said yes, and he, like, talked up his house, and, like, everything in the house, in, like, I think, we had 12 days to be in school, and we probably had to have the house back, within, like, I don't know, less than a week, so that was a crazy week, but, but, uh, Victor was a, uh, great help, in, like, we were going to a country, we'd never been to before, didn't know much about, Victor had also, uh, moved to Asia, a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything, and he knew, he knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out, tremendously, so, yeah, it was a great experience, it was an exciting time to be in China, was right around the first Olympics, you know...


**SPEAKER_00:**
Like, it was, right around that, the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time, but, yeah, you wound up staying, for about 18 months, right, in total, and, um, a little less, but, yeah, it was, it was over a year, yeah, and then we just kept in touch, from there, like, we loved working together, yeah, what year did you arrive, um, what was this rough time, yeah, who are you asking, because it was different, uh, you, Jim...


**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, 2011, 2011, summer, we're driving all over the country, 2011, September, August, I can't remember, we were, we were in Beijing, gotcha, gotcha, very cool, and so then you're back, end of 2012, or early 2013, something like that, yeah, we were back in the country, in 2013, gotcha, but, like, January...


**SPEAKER_05:**
Let me, I'll segue, I'll try to keep it, slightly chronological, to keep everything in my mind, here, consistent. So, I was in grad school, at Berkeley, between 2012, and, really, 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum, kind of, purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but, basically, the...
I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm going to say, spring 2014, or, maybe, May, April, or May, 2014. So, for those who are not aware, of how a PhD program works, qualifying exam is, like, one of the last things you need to do, before you just do the research, and produce the thesis.
So, sometimes, it's a coursework requirement, sometimes, you need to, you know, translate a work, from, like, an academic work, from one language to another, to show proficiency. I think, most of them, have dropped those requirements, at this point. And, so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep, at Berkeley, it's a three-hour oral exam, with a couple of people, from your department, and one, from an external department, and, then, they give you a pass, or not. I got a pass, thankfully, it was a...


**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, okay, that's good, so you're just, like, very nervous, I don't know, what it was, like, for you, but, for me, it was, just, like, three guys, I knew, and, I was nervous, too, but, it wasn't, like, they had to go, and, like, uh, you know, like, calculate numbers, or something, they just kind of come out, and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, it was, no, it was, like, that, right, yeah, it's, it's a, oral, it's...


**SPEAKER_05:**
Subjective, in a sense, but, you've got, several, of the world's, foremost experts, in some subjects, so, they're able to assess, whether you understand it, enough, or not, to proceed, with research.
The qualifying exam, led to, I needed a short break, from math, I was in mathematical physics, and, I had, almost, taken a job, working for a data science company, that was taking, I can't quite remember, something, having to do with Nielsen TV ratings, and doing something, with the data, and maybe selling it back, to networks, I can't remember, at this time.
But, you know, it seemed, like an okay thing, I also wanted to go back, to New York, for the summer, I'm from New York, and, you know, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time, to adapt, to the California culture, and, I didn't fully, do it, I still, you know, I'm prone, sometimes, to bash the Bay Area, but, I still, kind of, like it, there, I'm sitting, there, right now, by the way, yes, yes, Jim's there, I'm in the state of New York, at the moment...


**SPEAKER_05:**
But, but, yeah, but, you know, I need a little break, basically, and, it ended up, um, being possible, to work on the Ethereum project, um, so, somehow, um, my, you know, I guess, I'll go into this, somehow, uh, my dad, Joe Lubin, got attached, to the project, basically, because he was always, he was tracking Bitcoin, blockchain, for a long time, um, he had a CS background, plus the financial background, and ran a hedge fund, for a number of years, and, so, it's just, kind of, always watching, technological innovations, in financial services, and, I guess, always had a little bit, of the, you know, blockchain philosophical character, in that, you know, let's say, pro-freedom, little bit of a libertarian streak, kind of thing...


**SPEAKER_02:**
And, I believe, he happened to just be visiting, our families, he's from Toronto, a lot of blockchain people, in Toronto, for one reason, or another, and, he went, I believe, to, it might have been, a Bitcoin meetup, at that time, or, it might have been, the first Ethereum meetup, but, this would have been, January, February, 2014, I believe, um, and Vitalik was speaking there, and, um, you know, like, everyone, around that time, where, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
Did you see Vitalik speak, about something, um, you got really excited, right, and, so, he actually got ready, to start helping out, the project, right away, he actually thought, for a time, that he might be, a software developer, for the project, um, and, you know, it didn't turn out, that way, we can go into it, a little bit later, but, he started working on it, again, let's take, February, March, um, 2014, and, so, he just sent me, the white paper, like, right after, maybe, right before, my qualifying exam, I got a chance, to read it, um, and, it was, pretty cool, and interesting, and new, and, that was, sort of, the first time, I grasped, the potential, of the technology, and, it caused me, to go back, and read, the Bitcoin white paper, etc., and, it was, sort of, exciting enough, to work on, for that summer, basically, so, that's how I got into it, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
And, subsequently, um, you know, Jim, Jim alluded to this earlier, I started to work, with the project, and, um, reached out, to Steve Shu, a great, great friend, of ours, um, kind of, I don't know, not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous, um, uh, super cool guy, uh, and, I've been a long-time reader, of Steve's blog, he's one of the, um, few, really excellent, uh, kind of general communicators, who's a super technical guy, but, most people, who are really technical, in communication, have a hard time, distilling it, for, at least, kind of, a mass market audience, uh, but, Steve is actually good, at that, uh...


**SPEAKER_05:**
And, so, um, caught up, with Steve, um, and, that takes us, to, um, Steve forwarding, on the Ethereum white paper, to Jim, and, I believe, the first time, I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but, was just about to go back, to the Bay Area, so, that takes us, to, maybe, June, July, 2014, and, maybe, I came back, in August, or something, like that, and, it turned out, that Jim, was there, in Hayward, and, we got to meet up...


**SPEAKER_02:**
What do you, really think, August, 2014, September, something, like that, oh, it was around, then, because, uh, um, also, ironically, I was driving, across the country, that summer, too, and, uh, it was, right after, I came back, that's, all, your big life changes, are related, to some cross-country, you do, a soul searching, you do, a literal search, well, see, I was, in Montana, and, then, I was back, in the Bay Area, and, then, we talked...


**SPEAKER_05:**
Yeah, okay, that's cool, how was Montana, by the way, well, maybe, we shouldn't go, yeah, um, Montana, oddly, crypto-friendly, yeah, yeah, makes sense, big sky country, right, yeah, that's my country, um, okay, so, let me see, here, I want to, um, I have a couple, other, 2014, anecdotes, that, uh, you guys, may not even know, that much about, but, maybe, we should jump ahead...


**SPEAKER_00:**
To 2015, and, go back, so, just before, we go past, 2014, so, I moved back, from China, um, in 2014, and, so, you know, me, and Jim, were talking, about, like, oh, now, that we were, I was back, what kind of project, could we do together, so, while, you had started, that conversation, me, and Jim, were, like, thinking, about, okay, you know, like, maybe, we could work, on a startup, together, and, at some point, you forwarded, me, the paper, as well, so, like, I think, once, so, that's, that's, kind of, how I got into it, as well, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
I want to give, yeah, I don't want to speak, the whole time, but, I have some info, here, that, I forget, if I told, you guys, at length, okay, go for it, in 2014, so, basically, I did work, on the Ethereum project, through, a bunch of, 2014, projects, as far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European, but, you had Canada, you had a bunch of people, in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit, in Israel, in the early days...


**SPEAKER_05:**
We worked out of an office, my dad, and I, and, Guy named Stephen Narayoff, who is now, kind of famous, actually, if you Google the name, it's definitely an interesting, and colorful story, that I'll go into, a little bit, and, a guy named Jonathan, whose last name, I couldn't find, when I was writing this down, but, Jonathan's a good guy, and, I don't know, if they parted ways, at some point, or, how that all happened, so, we're working, in this office, in Times Square, and, you know, really trying to find, kind of different ways, to advance the project, meeting with lots of people, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
So, that's when I met, um, Steve Shu, who introduced me to Jim, basically, just kind of calling up, whoever might be interested, but, part of the plans, that the Ethereum, uh, folks had, was, you know, they had the, they acknowledged, that, um, there would be a need, for kind of ongoing, pure research, and, then, in addition to more, like focused R&D, to build the network out, and, so, Vitalik, at some point, pended article, about, you know, 10 hard problems, in cryptocurrency, or, or something, of that nature, in which, and, I think, it was...


**SPEAKER_05:**
If we went back, now, it would look, both very insightful, and a little bit dated, I'm sure, some of them, have been solved, and, some of them, may not need to be solved, because something else emerged, basically, foresaw, that they, the, the need for, you know, uh, privacy, above and beyond pseudonymity, for instance, yeah, or, and, you know, many things, with that transition, from proof of work, to mistake, or just like energy-efficient blockchains, which people were talking about, at that time, but, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
My position, in academia, at that time, seemed to be helpful, as the blockchain people, were just so different, from the academia people, despite both of them, being really smart groups, of people, blockchain people, were not worried, about doing things, through the proper channels, and approval, and writing it up, the right way, and all that sort of thing, whereas, something about academia, makes you, fearful of being wrong, um, because, you're wrong, enough, in public, there are, kind of consequences, for it, uh, and, the kind of, I would say, tech attitude, in general, is like, getting something out there, you know, get it to work, basically, but, get it out, and, then, iterate, um...


**SPEAKER_05:**
And, blockchain people, had that, you know, in a extreme, and, I would say, also, Ethereum, was much more, like that, than the Bitcoin culture, the Bitcoin culture, was like, a bunch of practicing, but, academic cryptographers, who never wanted to change anything, um, and, the Ethereum people, were more, like
