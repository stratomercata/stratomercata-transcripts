<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a clean, readable transcript from the raw audio transcript they provided. The main goal is to preserve all the content while making it more readable.

First, I need to check the rules they provided. The most important ones are preserving all dialogue, keeping the same length, and maintaining the timestamps. I also need to correct technical terms, proper names, and punctuation.

Looking at the raw transcript, there's a lot of back-and-forth conversation with timestamps. I need to make sure each line starts with the correct speaker label in bold, followed by the timestamp in [MM:SS] format. The timestamps need to be rounded to the nearest second, using two digits for both minutes and seconds.

I notice some technical terms like "Ethereum" might be misspelled or lowercase. I should correct those. Also, names like "Vitalik" should be properly capitalized. There are some instances where people's names are mentioned with different spellings, like "Vic" vs. "Victor Wong." I need to ensure consistency using the provided list of known people.

Next, punctuation and sentence structure. The raw transcript has a lot of fragmented sentences and missing punctuation. I'll add periods, commas, and capitalize the first letter of each sentence where necessary. Also, remove excessive filler words like "um," "uh," and "you know" where they don't affect the meaning.

I need to check for any false starts or repetitions and clean those up without altering the content. For example, if someone says "the the contract," I'll change it to "the contract." But I must not remove any substantial content or technical explanations.

Paragraph breaks should be added where there's a natural transition in the conversation, like when a new topic is introduced. This will make the transcript easier to read while keeping the original flow.

I also need to verify that all timestamps are present and correctly formatted. Each line of dialogue should have a timestamp at the beginning. If there are any missing timestamps, I'll need to estimate them based on the context, but since the user hasn't provided specific timestamps, I'll assume they are already present in the input.

Finally, I'll ensure that the output length is approximately the same as the input. If the input is around 15,000 words, the output should be between 13,500 to 16,500 words. I'll count the words to confirm this. If it's significantly shorter, I'll need to go back and ensure I haven't removed any content.

By following these steps, I can create a clean, readable transcript that meets all the user's requirements while preserving the original content and structure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alrighty.
So we're on.
Thanks.
So
my name is Karen James Lubin .
I'm joined by
Jim or James from SDR and Victor Wong.
We are old friends.
We also run a company together, called block apps, which has been in operation for for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum
and enjoyed
the really crazy and wild ride, you know, that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened.
And so we wanted to kind of, know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for for posterity, and here we are.
So with that said, I'll, kinda take the lead on the discussion, but we you know, we're we're not trying to be formal here .
Trying to make it conversational.
This is a first
of a, you know, current produced podcast
of sorts .
I've been on a bunch of them .
I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes.
Alrighty.
So let's let's start out with
the question,
when were you first aware of Bitcoin
and blockchain in particular ?
I'll give my answer to start,
and
there's still a kicking myself aspect to it .
So I became aware I'm gonna say 2010,
possibly 2011,
so this would have been my senior year in undergrad,
of Bitcoin .
And I distinctly remember it being $3
down from a recent peak of 14 or $15.
I thought it was interesting
and,
you know, looked into it a little bit .
I didn't really get the idea of decentralization
at the time .
I just imagined it as
some sort of digital money solution .
You know, I'd
if you ask me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and,
you know, digital
banking or a pay a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing .
And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough,
of course .
So,
that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
When were you first aware of Bitcoin slash Where is different than, like, interested ?
In fact, like, I I don't know .
I was like I I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it .
But but I was, like, a little bit too too above all that .
Like, oh, that's like a money thing .
I'm I'm not interested in that money world.
So,
really, no .
Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, was a,
an old friend of mine and that
Kieran had been following his blog.
And
and,
Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you you have to go look at this Ethereum thing .
And so, at first, I was like, yeah .
You know, I'm not interested in all this this
fake money thing.
And I went and I read the white paper.
And by the end of the white paper, I was I was hooked in .
I was like, this isn't just about, like like, banking or something .
This is about incentivization
on the Internet, and that drew me in .
So
and at that point, I I and there was enough ambiguous
stuff being discussed .
I I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked .
So that's when I I started, like, trying to write code that would, connect to one of the peers and see how they and and at the time, it was a test net.
And, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there .
So,
well, I don't know .
Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
Let's, Jim, we'll pick that up .
I'm I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological,
so I you know, 2010,
2011 sounds like same time frame for you .
I think, we'll pull back in a
question or two
right to that era,
and we'll talk in in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But let's let's hold on it for just a a moment .
Vic, do you wanna take it ?
Yeah .
I think I became aware of it around the same time as you .
I was I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and
I I felt really disconnected
from North America, so I became sort of an early
fan of podcasts.
And one of the big podcast networks
was this thing called Twit that was, like, all technical podcasts .
And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast,
security now, which went really deep into these kind of, like, security technical kind of things .
And he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin.
And I was, like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin .
Or if I did, I did notice it .
I I wish I think the rewards were, like, 50 at the time or something like this .
But the the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other
Chinese startups, there'd be, like, groups of computers in, like, part of their office .
And I was like, what are those for ?
And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin .
And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin ?
And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can, like, transfer money and, like, it's basically free Internet magic money .
And I was like,
I I honestly was were kind of repelled by that .
Like, that kind of seemed, like, too nutty even for me at the time.
Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I never hated it .
I was sort of just, like,
not that interested, I guess.
You know, I think,
from
the
East Coast,
the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable .
I think, Jimmy, would long since been out in California doing, like, yeah, you know, after your physics days .
But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda like like, I guess I didn't hate it .
I just felt I was too good for it.
I see .
I I didn't hate it, but I think

**SPEAKER_02:**
I found
the like
like, everyone talked about so I was fascinated the technical aspect, like I said .
Like, you know, I and it got me to read the white paper and even, like, download the software .
But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they're like
they were, like, kind of fanatical.
Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say .
Yeah .
Jim, I would say

**SPEAKER_00:**
the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic
track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored
crypto.
Some of them weighed in on it,
but,
yeah, I I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most
successful in some sense people at that time, Whereas,
you know, fighting against,
not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics or or something .
It's just like the
most horsepower wins from a, you know, intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest working horsepower.
Very few of those people
got interested
in in,
you know, crypto blockchain .
A few cryptographers
certainly did and probably actually more established ones
as far as, you know, compared to, like, younger ones, like folks like Dan Benet, etcetera .
But, yeah, I think
I don't know that it was that I was too good for it,
but that,
one, I didn't grasp right away that it was
revolutionary,
and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess .
Yeah .
I I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_02:**
sketchy because
most of the use cases that like, I thought the technology was fascinating,
but whenever I would ask about you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case ?
Why would you use it ?
And people would describe,
you know, things to circumvent existing laws .
Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff .
And I was like, is that legal ?
And, like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, I I wanna say I got Sorry .
I

**SPEAKER_01:**
got over feeling too good for it .
I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
And we all did it .
Yeah.
I I wanna touch on the other the big thing that sticks out of my memory
from the the early blockchain era is and and we've
kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mt .
Gox .
So Mt .
Gox
Mhmm .
Was that first big price run up .
I believe Bitcoin went from, like, $30 to
$1,200
in Yep .
A pretty short time frame.
And as we've seen in the last couple,
you know, crypto,
you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person.
To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price,
and,
people are getting excited about price momentum.
Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing .
More people come in, and it goes all the way up .
And then seemingly invariably,
the bubble bursts,
and someone is fleeced at the top.
You know?
And, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof,
everyone's hurt on the other side .
And then sort of the crypto is somehow this way of surviving all of this .
The protocols themselves seem to be, you know, quite sound.
But I guess the question is,
do you guys remember Mt .
Gox distinctly ?
I feel like everyone lots of people I knew who were not
crypto savvy in the industry, etcetera, were suddenly paying attention when was happening .
With the hot topic just getting into things .
Yeah .
I I what year was it ?
Was it 2015, 2014 ?
2014, probably .
Right ?
I think docs was 13 .
Let me check .
Yeah .
I think was 13.
Yeah .
Okay .
So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.
I was new enough to it that it was still I was observing it as a, you know, like, a third party.
You know ?
It was it was interesting to me .
But but, yeah, I I spent a little time to understand
what because, you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it .
They didn't explain what was going on .
So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but, no, it had nothing to do with blockchain.
It was,
it was oh, there's

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think you're right .
So the run up was actually '13
into the '14,
it it looks like .
Or okay .
So it officially shuttered February.
Though
and the big the 1200 that I remember was, like, November
2013,

**SPEAKER_02:**
it looks like .
When did the hack happen ?
December .
Oh, it happened .
Right here .
Okay .
Okay .
Yeah .
Happened right there .
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So,
yeah, interesting times for sure .
Because I think MonkDocs

**SPEAKER_02:**
and oh, what was I'm blanking right now .
What what was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road .
Silk Road .
Yeah .
Like, I think it's
those were kind of intertwined
in in those early days .
Right ?
So I remember,
like, even you going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kinda shocked with what I saw listed there .
Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was list listed there .
You know ?

**SPEAKER_00:**
wow .
You know, I think I never did that .
I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road.
Just heard about it at length .
I had an account,
and some others .
There's a period where, like, was
doing crypto stuff,
and then I think they stopped.
And I I believe they're still around as, like, a payment API company.
But

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah .
Because I I remember them and some others .
I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt .
Gox hacks
came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was, like, the sort of, like you know,
as we've as you mentioned, like, the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then and then it just keeps coming back .
Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
It sure does.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay .
There's a little bit of bias in the new the news on how they cover,
problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional,
world .
Like, if if there's if there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place .
And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person.
So it's always, like,
much more tied into you know, the the price of of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens.
But you don't see, like, crashing because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere.
I mean, I guess fraud's big enough .
But

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
Agreed.
Just segue
does happen sometimes.
Yeah.
Segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met ?
Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all Yeah .
Jim, do do I do I wanna start, or do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'll start, and and I'll pass it over .
I, actually
so I had,
back in the nineties, was in academia in the in the aughts.
I was, in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups .
And I was ending one of my startups,
and I had,
two sons who were in the our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school.
And I,
at at this time, there was just a coincidence .
Both my wife and I,
had ended jobs.
And we said, hey .
Let's just been crazy right now, and and let's let's take this to to its extension .
Let's let's go to
China and actually put them in a school there .
So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded
a startup of Victor's in Beijing .
And he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys .
So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now, and you can explain .
Well yeah .
And and so the VC,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, who we're still friends with, like,
he kinda came up to me, and he he explicitly said,
like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO,
and he says he wants to come to China .
I'm not sure how serious he is .
So you know what ?
Don't put all your eggs in this basket .
But then we started
talking that summer,
and you weren't, like, traveling in the country, so you were, like, in a different place every couple of advantage of us both

**SPEAKER_01:**
being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and I remember, like, you know, like, we were kinda talking over the summer, and I was, like, seeing how serious you were about coming .
And
and at one point, you said, okay .
Look .
If you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing .
And I
went to the school that my kids went to, which and
said, like, you know, can you make space for,
you know, two foreign kids, this inter international program ?
They said, yes.
If you can but the kids have to be here the first day of school .
And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.
So I called Jim up and said, look .
I can do it .
You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day .
And to my shock, he actually said yes, and he, like, parked up his house and, like, you know, he turned off packed everything in the house in, like I think we had twelve days to be in school, and we probably were

**SPEAKER_01:**
the had to have the house back within,
like like, I don't know, less than a week .
So Yeah .
That was a crazy week.
But but
Victor was a great help in like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about .
Victor had also, moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything .
And he knew he knew where the good schools were .
He knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So Yeah .
It was a great experience .
It was an exciting time to be in China .
It was right around the first Olympics .
You know ?
Like, it was right around that the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time .
But, yeah, you wound up staying for about eighteen months, right, in total?
And A little less, but, yeah, it was it was over a year .
Yeah .
And then we just kept in touch from there .
Like, we loved working together.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
It was great .
Year did you arrive?
Or what was this rough time to your period ?
Yeah .
Who were you asking ?
Because it was different for me .
You, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, 2011.
2011 .
Twenty eleven summer .
2011,
September,
August .
I can't remember .
We were we were in Beijing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Gotcha.
Gotcha .
Very cool.
And so then you're back
2012
or early twenty thirteen, something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah .
We were back at, when did we come back ?
I guess we were back in the country in 2013.
Gotcha .
It's about, like, January.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Let me I'll segue .
I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep, you know, everything in my mind here
consistent.
So
I was in grad school,
at at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015.
Mhmm.
I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident.
Maybe not purely by accident, but, basically,
the
I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm gonna say,
2014
or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014 .
So for those who have not,
not aware of how,
Phd program works, qualifying exam is, like, one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.
So sometimes there's a coursework requirement .
Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like, an academic work from one language to to another to show proficiency.
I think, most of them have dropped those requirements,
at this point.
And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley .
It's a three hour oral exam with couple people from your department and one from an external department,
and then they give you a pass or not .
I got a pass, thankfully .
It was a
I don't know that it was it was everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good .
Right ?
Like, and,
you know, so
while I passed it, I it it was, like, you know, didn't feel great the at least the rest of that day.

**SPEAKER_01:**
But when do you find out the result ?
Like, is it Immediately .
Oh, you do ?
Okay .
They put you in the hall, and they tell you .
Yeah .
Okay .
That's good .
So you're just, like, very nervous for I don't know what it was like for you, but for me, it was just, like, three guys I knew .
And I I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and, like,
you know, like, calculate numbers or something .
They just kinda come out, and they're like, yeah .
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Exactly .
It no .
It was it was like that .
Right ?
Yeah .
It's it's a oral .
It's
subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got, like, several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects .
So they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.
So, anyways, so
I kind of
the qualifying exam led to
you know, I I needed, like, a short break from math .
I was in mathematical physics,
and I had almost taken a job working
for
sort of a data science company that was taking I can't quite remember.
So something having to do with, like, Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to,
networks .
I I can't can't remember at this time.
But, you know, it seemed like a okay thing .
I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer .
I'm from New York .
And, you know, as as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it .
I still,
you know, I'm prone sometimes
to bash the Bay Area,
but I still kinda like it there.
But anyway That's by the way.
Yes .
Yes .
Jim's there .
I'm I'm in the state of New York at the moment.
But but yeah .
But I, know, I need a little break, basically.
And it ended up
being possible to work on the Ethereum project.
So somehow,
my
you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow.
My dad, Joe got
attached
to the project basically because
he was always he was tracking
Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time.
He had a
CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years .
And so it's just kind of always watching
technological
innovations
in financial services.
And I guess always had a little bit of the,
you know, blockchain philosophical
character,
in that, you know, let's say,
pro pro freedom, little little bit of a libertarian
streak kinda thing.
And I believe he happened to just be visiting our family .
So he's from Toronto .
A lot of,
a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another .
And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup.
But
this would have been January, February
2014, I believe.
And Vitalik was speaking there .
And,
you you see that Alex speak about something,
you got really excited .
Right ?
And so he actually
got ready to start helping out the project right away .
He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project
and, you know, it did didn't turn out that way .
We can go into it, a little bit later.
But
he started working on it again, let's say, February, March,
2014.
And so he just sent me the white paper, like, right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam .
I got a chance to read it,
and it was pretty cool and interesting and new .
And it's that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etcetera .
And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer, basically .
And,
subsequently,
you know, Jim Jim alluded to this earlier,
I started to work with the project and
reached out to Steve Shu, a great great friend of ours.
Kind of
I don't know .
Not not quite famously brilliant .
Definitely brilliant, somewhat famous.
Super cool guy,
and I'd I'd been a longtime reader of Steve's blog .
He's one of the
few really excellent
kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but with Nuance coverage of technical topics .
So, anyway,
caught up with Steve,
and that takes us to
Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.
And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York,
but was just about to go back to the Bay Area .
So that takes us to maybe Janu or sorry, June, July
2014.
And maybe I came back in August or or something like that .
And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in in Hayward,
and we got to meet up
I wonder if you did anything .
August 2014, September, something like that ?
Oh, it was around then because,

**SPEAKER_01:**
also, ironically,
I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back .
That's weird .
Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip .
You do a Obviously .
Soul searching .
You do a literal search .
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Cross country.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well See, I was in Montana, and then I was back in the Bay Area, and then we talked.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah .
Okay.
That's how was Montana, by the way ?
It did wow .
Maybe we shouldn't go to yeah.
Montana, oddly crypto friendly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah .
Yeah .
Makes sense .
Big Sky Country .
Right ?
Yeah .
Big Sky Country.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay.
So
let me see here .
I want to I have a couple other 2014
anecdotes
that
you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead
to 2015 and go back .
So Just before we we go past 2014.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So I moved back from
China
in 2014.
And so, you know, me and Jim were talking about, like, oh, now that we were I was back, what kind of project could we do together ?
So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were, like, thinking about, okay .
You know, like, maybe we could work on the startup together.
And at some point, you forward me the paper as well .
So, like, I think once so that's that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I I wanna give yeah .
I I don't wanna speak the whole time, but but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length .
Okay .
Go for it.
In
2014
so so, basically, I
did work on the Ethereum projects through a bunch of twenty fourteen.
As far as tech projects go, it was much more global,
little more European,
but, you know, you had Canada .
You got a had a bunch of people in Zug,
Switzerland,
a little bit in Israel in the early days.
The
we worked out of an office.
My dad and I and
guy named Steven who
is now
kinda famous .
Actually, if you Google the name, you know, it's, it's definitely an interesting and and colorful story,
that I'll go into a little bit .
And a guy named Jonathan, whose last name I I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a a good guy .
And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or, you know, how how that all happened.
So we're working in this office in
Times Square and,
you know, really
trying to find kind of different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people.
So, you know, that's when I met
Steve who introduced
me to Jim, basically, just kind of calling up whoever might be interested .
But part of the plans that the Ethereum
folks had was you know, they acknowledged
that
there would be a need for kinda ongoing pure research and then in addition to more, like, focused r and d to to build the network out.
And
so Vitalik, at some point, penned an article about, you know, 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or or something of that nature
in which and I think it was,
if we went back now, it would look both, you know,
very insightful and a little bit dated .
I'm sure some of them have been solved, and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged.
But, basically, he foresaw that they the the need for,
you know, privacy above and beyond
pseudonymity,
for instance .
Yeah .
Or and, you know, many things of that transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just like energy efficient blockchains, which people were talking about at that time .
But,
you know, my
position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful
as, you know, the
blockchain people were just so different from the academia people despite being, like, both of them being really smart groups of people.
Blockchain people were not worried about, like, doing things through the proper channels and,
you know, approval and writing it up the right way and, you know, all that sort of thing .
Whereas, you know, something about academia
makes you
fearful of being wrong,
because you're you're wrong enough in public.
There are kind of consequences for it.
And the kind of I would say the tech attitude in general is, like, getting something out there .
You know,
get it to work, basically, but get it out and then iterate.
And
blockchain people had that,
you know, in a
extreme .
And I I would say, also,
Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture .
The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of
practicing but academic cryptographers
who never wanted to change anything.
And the Ethereum people were more like
have, like, the software and computer science engineering attitude of, like, well, let's get out there .
Let's let's tinker with it .
Let's kinda see what happens .
And, you there's good arguments for both, especially when we're talking about, like, a system that custodies
well, not custodies, but, you know, that
records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred.
But
all that is to say, it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have sort of someone who's actively in academia to kinda work with and coordinate everything .
So we
agreed to work on a body called the cryptocurrency research group,
and that was composed of sort of myself,
Vitalik,
and our friend Aaron Wright.
Was kind of the he's a since going on to a number of web three projects, but at the time was a practicing
attorney,
but also a professor at Cardoso
Law School.
And he came to that Times Square office, which was, you know, not the greatest of offices, I would I would say, and just sorta really leaned in on,
Ethereum
and kinda helped
structure everything
so that,
you know, it would be kind of the most robust,
not just technology, but they they actually did kind of a quite good job in figuring out,
how to set things up,
that other projects since did you know, certainly did not do as as good a job, I'll say.
So, you know, it was it was funny times.
And in 2014, I also got to go to
Zug.
For those who don't know, the Ethereum Foundation
was one of the first to head to to be headquartered
in
Switzerland,
and it was kind of it's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations,
because I guess the Ethereum Foundation
sort of blazed a path.
And okay .
Funny thing about Switzerland
is that the kind of local authorities
also seem like business people .
Like, they wanna land the future tax revenue and employment.
And so you can kind of
once Switzerland is split into some number of Cantons, which are like states, well, a little smaller than US states, of course.
And
so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer .
And offer really means, like, you know, tax treatment,
any kind of grants, or just like you know ?
And and helping
get fast answers
around legal questions .
You know, one of the tough things with The United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed.
And
the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear, you know, about what what they wanted for the special tax treatment and, you know, etcetera, etcetera .
So
so we went out and visited Zug,
I don't know, mid late summer twenty fourteen, and I got to meet
all of the founders of Ethereum at that time .
I believe there are kind of eight in total.
And
yeah .
So I think

**SpeakEr_01:**
Those numbers changed over time, though .
Yeah .
Those numbers changed .
Yes .
So

**speakEr_00:**
well but but yeah .
I think so
I don't exactly know how all of it happened,
but, you know, Vitalik there's always a global project .
Right ?
So Vitalik would kinda go around the world and evangelize,
get people excited,
and they would wanna work with the project.
And,
you know, it it I think, obviously, it worked .
Right ?
But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about
adding folks to it because it eight is just, like, too many .
Like, if you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight cofounders,
and they're not all,
you know, currently running billion dollar companies,
you'd be be just laughed out of the room .
And yet it it worked .
Right ?
It actually functioned.
And the you know ?
So kind of the way it broke apart was that there were, like, the technical element
technical guys .
So I think I don't quite know how this happened, but pretty early on, like, Gavin Wood,
Jeff Wilkie
started
building out versions of Ethereum,
the c plus plus and
Go
clients .
Specifically, we're going to the clients soon because there's good stories there.
Metallic was building the Python client .
They were all working together on technical documentation.
And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that Bitcoin was controlled and centralized
because there's only really one definitive client, Bitcoin d .
Right?
And
so
there was this kinda huge
replication of technical effort .
Like, each of them eventually got their own teams .
There were JavaScript clients.
You know, there's, you know, many of them kinda came out later.
And
I'd say the project
so the project had sort of tech folks and business folks, like like any
tech project
didn't really have a nominal CEO at at any time .
It
was closest to being Charles Hoskinson.
So
I think at the time I went to Zug,
the
leadership
looked like
on the business side, Charles is the CEO.
Emir,
who is in Israel, he kinda did
business development .
He's a funny guy.
I still see him
every once in a while.
Joe, my dad, and Anthony DiOrio as
the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience.
And then the tech side
was Vitalik,
Jeff,
Gavin,
and then Mihai
had sort of done corporate setup .
I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine.
So Vitalik,
very
interesting character where, you know, most of the time, your technical geniuses are not good communicators,
and
he was sort of a journalist
running Bitcoin magazine,
running a lot of the articles.
I don't know if he started it or kind of joined it.
And, you know, he would, he would I think he kinda crowdfunded
the articles a little bit .
Like,
for you know, if I can get a pledge of 1 Bitcoin, I'll write an article about x .
You know ?
And at the time, Bitcoin was
inexpensive,
but, you know, those those values went up, and I I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism,
you know, the articles he wrote in the future .
And it led him to kind of have a
sort of impartial
thought leader position in addition to his
really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating, etcetera .
And I know he had joined a bunch of projects
early on
and helped work with them.
Like, I think Mastercoin
was maybe the first colored coin project .
He did some work on that .
So,
anyway, so those were the eight at the time.
And
the there was a meeting for everyone to kinda get on the same page .
You know, remote project, there was a Slack.
People were
maybe working a little bit at cross purposes,
lots of infighting .
People are stressed .
They're trying to deliver on this, like, awesome concepts that Vitalik put out there.
And then everyone kinda tried to grab ownership of .
Like, was there a reason to have all these different clients ?
You know, in the end, empirically, it worked .
Right ?
But a little bit of it was a,
want,
you know, Ethereum to be mine sort of thing .
And
he's I saw this in the room
when we're we're visiting there .
So, basically,
it kind of quite
it was quite dramatic, the trip .
So so, basically, on this this trip,
everyone went outside at some point, and people were kind of a little bit sick .
The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing
to some extent .
You know ?
There's always this tension .
It's not probably especially early in a company where,
you know, the tech people are like, what what do I need you business guy for ?
Like, we're gonna make this thing, and it's, like, gonna get out there .
And the the business people,
you know, have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships,
etcetera .
And it's subjective stuff that the tech people
don't like or sometimes understand.
And
more or less, this happened .
You know ?
People are uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making,
and just the accusations .
I don't really even you know, I I know Charles some,
but I don't even really know what was going on at at that time .
But there was this general sense of frustration with him .
He also he seems to be, in some ways, executing well on, like, a effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of
breaking people out .
I know we kinda seen later,
you know, I I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive,
I would say.
But that you know, the jury was not out at that time in my eyes .
Right?
And Emir also was in Target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like .
And so they were both
jettisoned
**SPEAKER_01:**
from the project in Zug.
You know ?
And I was like, they were, like, out on the terrace .
It's like and they had, like, a nice sort of loft that they rented that was, like, the Ethereum dev house in Zug.
And so I'm, like, watching this happen and, you know, it
it was kind of,
you know, quite crazy.
And then, actually, they instated
two more cofounders,
so to speak, right then,
who kinda jumped on board the project and and helped out.
It was a it was, like, a fun and kind of, crazy trip otherwise .
You know, we went out in Zurich.
Some people got in trouble
**SPEAKER_02:**
with the cops .
I won't add more detail to to that .
But, Zurich's a funny place where in The US, we're not used to people drinking on the street .
And in Zurich, everyone drinks on the street, and few people are in the bars .
You know ?
It was a strange experience .
We went on some hikes .
You know ?
It's it's a very nice part of the world,
Switzerland .
But
plenty of drama, you know, in the early days .
I I remember having a funny conversation with about
like, he had this book about, like, swarm behavior,
and, you know, he learned I had a mathematical background as we're talking about, like, the the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.
But, yeah, the the it felt
nascent,
intense,
but disorganized.
They were also grappling with the decision on initially, they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol
and a for profit .
They called it crypto Google at the time
to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol .
And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently.
But that was also
decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit.
Yeah .
And people didn't like it .
You know, some folks started talking about brain drain.
It it was a mix .
Some people liked it .
Some some didn't.
Sort of the threat being, like, you don't do this for profit, like, I'm gonna leave this this project
kinda thing .
And I think about everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses.
So, you know,
it is what it is .
But, anyways,

**SPEAKER_02:**
let me let me pause and see if you got did I tell this whole story, you know, to to you guys at any point ?
I I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing .
But, yes, I I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect
happened in all of that period short period of time.
You know, that, like, I I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes .
And I think it was this all like, I think we weren't using Slack yet .
It was, like, there was tons of Skype .
Oh, lord .
There was, like, huge
like, we this was, like I think we weren't even using Slack yet .
It was, like, there was tons of Skype .
Slack was just getting popular at this time .
Ethereum had a Slack .

**SPEAKER_00:**
ConsenSys had a Slack .
We can get into the consensus story a little bit.
And
the
but, yeah, we had a Skype thread
for some reason, you know, like, just because it was the thing that people used for a threaded discussion group .
I think WhatsApp maybe wasn't popular or Yeah .
Not for this purpose .
You know ?
So

**SPEAKER_01:**
we spent a month It's dug around a while .
I dug around a while to figure out why in the world encryption had even been added to this .
And I I was like, irrationally angry about it .
Like, I was like, I didn't care whether this was good or or bad for the for the product .
I was like, why ?
But I was actually genuinely confused too because you have, like, this open network
that anyone can connect to, but you wanna encrypt everything that's going on it .
It took me a while to figure out why that actually happened .
I I was asking around
in various, like,
DM services .
I don't remember where where I used to go and talk to people.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I found There were the giants
Skype threads, I remember at the time .
Oh, lord .
