**SPEAKER_05:**
[00:01] My name is Karen James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James Hermosdiar and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[00:12] We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened.
[00:27] And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes.
[01:03] All righty. So let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad.
[01:24] of Bitcoin, and I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.
[01:39] If you ask me, then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:12] That said let me hand the question over to Jim when were you first aware of bitcoin? Aware is different than like interested in fact like i i don't know i was like i came from an academic background so i'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it but but i was like a little bit too above all that like oh that's like a money thing i'm not interested in that money world
[02:38] so uh uh really no like the interest came from when you reached out to steve who was a uh uh an old friend of mine and that uh uh um kieran had been following his blog and and uh steve called me up and he's like uh this guy kieran just called me up and you you have to go look at this ethereum thing and so uh at first i was like uh yeah you know i'm not interested in all this this uh uh fake money thing and i went and i read the white paper
[03:12] And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about like a banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet. And that drew me in. And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they, and at the time it was a test net.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[03:47] uh and uh and that's when i started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there so well i don't know let me pass on to victor yeah let's uh jim will pick that up i'm trying a little bit stay chronological so i you know i was 2010 2011 sounds like same time frame for you i think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era um and we'll talk in more detail uh but let's let's hold on it for just a moment uh vic do you want to take it

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:19] yeah I think I became aware of it um around the same time as you I was I was um you know doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time and I I felt really disconnected from North America so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts and one of the big podcast networks was this thing called twit that was like all technical podcasts and one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast security now which
[04:39] went really deep into these kind of like security technical kind of things and he did like a couple episodes of Bitcoin and I was like you know really really fascinated by it but mostly from a technical angle like and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it didn't get any Bitcoin or if I did uh
[05:01] I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be groups of computers in part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, we can...
[05:19] transfer money and it's basically free internet magic money and I was like I I honestly was kind of repelled by that like that kind of seemed too nutty even for me at the time did we all hate it before we liked it

**SPEAKER_05:**
[06:01] I never hated it I was sort of just like not that interested I guess um you know from the East Coast um the attitude towards like stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:15] yeah you know after your physics days you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like like I guess I didn't hate it I just felt I was too good for it but I think I found the like

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:28] like everyone talked about so I was fascinated the technical aspect like I said like you know and it got me to read the white paper and even like download the software but I think the part that kind of turned me off about was like when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask like who are saying a Bitcoin mining rigs they're like they were like kind of fanatical like there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off I would say

**SPEAKER_05:**
[07:12] Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing, mostly ignored.
[07:23] Crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract like the classically most successful in some sense people at that time. Whereas, you know, fighting against not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs like in math or physics or something. It's just like.
[07:42] the most horsepower wins from a you know intellectual perspective and I guess the hardest working horsepower very few of those people got interested um and in uh you know crypto blockchain a few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones um as far as uh you know compared to younger ones like folks like Dan Bonet etc but yeah I think
[08:12] I don't know that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess. Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:37] sketchy because most of the use cases that like i thought the technology was fascinating but whenever i would ask about you know i'm a product guy so i would always ask like what's the use case why would you use it and people would describe you know things to circumvent existing laws like the big one in china that i remember is like oh i can transfer money and bypass you know foreign exchange rules and stuff and i was like is that legal like no one would you know

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:01] mention anything afterwards basically yeah well i got over feeling uh too good for it i'll tell you that yeah and we all did yeah

**SPEAKER_05:**
[10:14] I want to touch on the other, the big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era is, and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple of times, was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run up. I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks to 1200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe.
[10:35] And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. So somebody said consumer interest tracks with the price. And people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top, you know.
[10:56] And whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side. And sort of crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound. But I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not...
[11:20] quite crypto savvy in the industry et cetera were suddenly paying attention when Mt. Gox was happening just getting into things I I what year was it was it 2015 2014 2014 probably right I think Docs was 13. let me check yeah okay 13. yeah okay so that was a little before but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time um
[11:47] uh i was new enough to it that it was still i was observing it as a you know like a third party you know it was it was interesting to me but but yeah i think i i spent a little time to understand what because you know the newspaper coverage like usual was terrible about it they didn't explain what was going on so i spent a little time to understand that yes there was a problem but no it had nothing to do with blockchain it was uh it was oh there's

**SPEAKER_05:**
[12:37] I think you're right, so the run up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14 it looks like or okay so it officially shuttered February 2014. Though, and the big the 1200 that I remember was like November 2013 it looks like. When did the hock happen. December. Oh, I think right here okay okay yeah right there yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:06] So, yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think about Mt. Gox and, oh, what was... I'm blanking right now. What was the name of that, you know, dark wood marketplace that used... Silk Road. Silk Road, yeah. Like, I think it's...
[13:27] those were kind of intertwined in those early days right so I remember like even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there like you know lots of illicit stuff was a list listed there you know

**SPEAKER_05:**
[14:02] that's wow you know I think I never did that I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road um just heard about it at like I had a mount gox account um and some others there was a period where like uh dwala was doing crypto stuff um and then I think they stopped um and I believe they're still around as like a payment API company um but um yeah because I definitely use them and some others

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:32] I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other and that was like the sort of like you know as we've as you mentioned like the first kind of iteration of like oh you know all crypto and blockchain is dead now and then it just keeps coming back right

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:03] Yeah, it sure does. There's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, it might mean that we need a little more regulation or something, but that was a bad person.
[15:26] so it's always like uh much more tied into you know that the price of of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens but you don't see like e crashing because like somebody commits fraud somewhere I mean I guess fraud's big enough but yeah I agreed um just a segue yeah

**SPEAKER_05:**
[16:03] segueing quickly can you guys go into how you met because you guys met first and then we can do the whole how we all yeah Jim do do I do I want to start or do you want to start

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:15] Uh, I'll start and I'll pass it over. I, uh, actually, so I had, uh, uh, back in the nineties, I was an academia and, uh, in the aughts, I was, uh, in the startup world and I'd done a couple startups and I was ending one of my startups and I had, uh, two sons who were in the, our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school.
[16:37] And at this time, there was just a coincidence. Both my wife and I had ended jobs. And we said, hey, let's just be crazy right now. And let's take this to its extension. Let's go to China.
[16:48] and actually put them in a school there so I called around some various friends and uh one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing and uh he says I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys so in fact let me pass it over to you right now and you can

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:23] Well, yeah. And so the VC, you know, who we're still friends with, like he kind of came up to me and he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started.
[17:40] talking that summer and you weren't like traveling in the country so you were like in a different place every another advantage of us both uh uh being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country and and I remember like
[18:02] knowing like we were kind of talking over the summer and I was like you know seeing how serious you were about coming and and at one point you said okay look if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing I will come and take the job to Beijing
[18:16] and I went to the school that my kids went to which and said like you know can you make space for um you know two foreign kids this inter international program they said yes if you can but the kids have to be here the first day of school and first day of school was two weeks from that conversation so I called Jim up and said look I can do it

**SPEAKER_02:**
[19:03] you know I can guarantee a place for them but you have to be here on this day and to my shock he actually said yes and he like talked up his house and like everything in the house in like I think we had 12 days to be in school and we probably were had the had to have the house back within like like I don't know less than a week so that was a crazy week
[19:23] but but uh victor was a uh great help in like we were going to a country we'd never been to before didn't know much about victor had also uh moved to asia a few years earlier and so he had sort of scoped out everything and he knew he knew where the good schools were he knew where the good apartment buildings were helped us out tremendously so yeah it was a great experience it was an exciting time to be in china was right around the first olympics you know

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:07] like it was right around that the Beijing Olympics and so it's a really exciting time but yeah you wound up saying for about 18 months right in total and um a little less but yeah it was it was over a year yeah and then we just kept in touch from there like we loved working together yeah what year did you arrive um what was this rough time yeah who are you asking because it was different uh you Jim

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:03] oh 2011. 2011 summer we're driving all over the country 2011 September August I can't remember we were we were in Beijing gotcha gotcha very cool and so then you're back end of 2012 or early 2013 something like that yeah we were back at um when did we come back I guess we were back in the country in 2013. gotcha but like January

**SPEAKER_05:**
[22:06] Let me, I'll segue, I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically the...
[22:28] I had passed my qualifying exam. I'm going to say spring 2014, or maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who are not aware of how a PhD program works, qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.
[22:43] So sometimes it's a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from like an academic work from one language to to another to show proficiency. I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point. And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley. It's a three hour oral exam with a couple of people from your department and one from an external department. And then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass. Thankfully, it was a.
[23:15] Subjective in a sense, but you've got several of the world's foremost experts in some subjects, so they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.
[23:26] The qualifying exam led to I needed a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics. And I had almost taken a job working for a data science company that was taking, I can't quite remember, something having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can't remember at this time.
[23:46] But, you know, it seemed like an okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York. And, you know, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture. And I didn't fully do it. I still, you know, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. I'm sitting here right now, by the way. Yes, yes, Jim's there. I'm in the state of New York at the moment.
[24:16] but but yeah but you know I need a little break basically and it ended up um being possible to work on the ethereum project um so somehow um my you know I guess I'll go into this somehow uh my dad Joe Lubin got attached to the project basically because he was always he was tracking Bitcoin blockchain for a long time um he had a
[24:39] Cs background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years, and so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the you know blockchain philosophical character in that you know let's say pro pro freedom little little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing.
[25:03] And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families. He's from Toronto. A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup.
[25:18] but this would have been January February 2014 I believe um and Vitalik was speaking there and um you know like everyone around that time where um
[25:31] did you see Vitalik speak about something um you got really excited right and so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away he actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project um and you know it didn't turn out that way we can go into it a little bit later but he started working on it again let's take February March
[25:49] um 2014 and so he just sent me the white paper like right after maybe right before my qualifying exam i got a chance to read it um and it was pretty cool and interesting and new and that was sort of the first time i grasped the potential of technology and it caused me to go back and read the bitcoin white paper etc and it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer basically so that's how i got into it um
[26:18] and subsequently um you know jim jim alluded to this earlier i started to work with the project and um reached out to steve shu a great great friend of ours um kind of uh i don't know not quite famously brilliant definitely brilliant somewhat famous um
[26:35] uh super cool guy uh and i've been a long time reader of steve's blog he's one of the um few really excellent uh kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time
[26:51] I don't distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience. Uh, but Steve is actually good at that. Uh, but with nuanced coverage of technical topics, so anyway, um, caught up with Steve, um, and that takes us to, um,
[27:09] Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. And I believe the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe June, July 2014. And maybe I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out that Jim was there in Hayward and we got to meet up.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:37] what do you really think August 2014 September something like that oh it was around then because uh um also ironically I was driving across the country that summer too and uh it was right after I came back that's all your big life changes are related to some cross country you do a soul searching you do a literal search well see I was in Montana and then I was back in the Bay Area and then we talked

**SPEAKER_05:**
[29:16] yeah okay that's cool how was montana by the way well maybe we shouldn't go yeah um montana oddly crypto friendly yeah yeah makes sense big sky country right yeah that's my country um okay so let me see here i want to um i have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that uh you guys may not even know that much about but maybe we should jump ahead

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:06] to 2015 and go back so just before we go past 2014. so I moved back from China um in 2014 and so you know me and Jim were talking about like oh now that we were I was back
[30:22] what kind of project could we do together so while you had started that conversation me and Jim were like thinking about okay you know like maybe we could work on a startup together and at some point you forward me the paper as well so like I think once so that's that's kind of how I got into it as well um

**SPEAKER_05:**
[31:26] Putting us in the client's arms race, if you will. That was the one I was trying to make. I want to talk real quickly about some other things from that summer. You guys participated in the crowd sale, did you not? That's why you bought the Bitcoin the first time? Or did you buy it sort of first? Yeah. Got a token amount. Gotcha.
[31:45] So the, from our, our side, um, we ended up, uh, mostly my dad, but obviously with help from the theory people. So they, they coded up a site to do the crowd sale. So Ethereum was one of the first, maybe the first, um, to pioneer basically, you know, a, um,
[32:04] kind of pre-funding event, if you will, where they sold the token Ether in exchange for Bitcoin to the users. Basically an ICO, right? It was essentially an ICO. There was no name for it then.
[32:16] But I remember the price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was like one Bitcoin to 2,000 Ether, which meant you made pretty good returns if you participated in the crowd sale and sold at the right time or still holding. But the way it worked, it was complicated. So Ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy.
[32:35] for bitcoin it was basically i think the ethereum foundation had um to set up an address for you to send the bitcoin to and so that they could mint the um the ether and the genesis block for you and you also
[32:49] but the the Foundation like you know rightfully in decentralization terms did not want to just hold everybody's keys right so you had to sort of generate your own keys and the website did this and download them and there's these huge warnings like you must download this file if you lose this file you will lose access to your funds and so that some of the the ethereum folks coded it up and um
[33:14] There was some, I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for traceability sake. I'm not quite sure if they did that. Maybe there was just one.
[33:25] exodus address or all that sort of thing but actually no there must have been just one so we were a little bit the help desk so sometimes people would try to find it wouldn't work um try to try to purchase ether um and there were interesting goings-on there were there was like a fake Twitter account that emerged um with the e and the u in ethereum transposed so it looked just like ethereum and they had assembled um
[34:02] you know, 25,000 followers or something, no doubt bots that whatever hacker controlled or maybe you pay for those. And they were offering special deals on ether.
[34:16] so it went live so this is something that's been going on for 10 years now um I you know even I've heard new crypto projects um you know when they start to get popular people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now so they've gotten more sophisticated uh but yeah so I I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping like escalate the ticket that you know uh because the like a big theft could occur and I believe did not
[34:51] Jonathan configured one of the block explorers, maybe it was blockchain.info, I can't remember, so that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play. So we were in this room and we were like, we're in the room all day because it's like, we're in like help desk mode. And we just hear the things come in and there was a schedule over like 14 days you could fund.
[35:20] at no monetary consequence. And then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a 42-day sale.
[35:28] All in all, I think 7,000 unique purchasers, something like that. But it was quite an affair. It's definitely more streamlined now. And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion that they're selling software, in essence, to people.
[35:42] from you know a reputable law firm and you know some of that all that made it to the terms and conditions it was a big rush to get it all done um and then so I think that raised didn't even remember it's like 22 million bucks at the time yeah I thought it was well it was in Bitcoin so I think it was like 20 million well I remember vaguely that it was the biggest crowdfunding
[36:14] event ever or something yeah I believe that's right it's either one or two ever at that time and it's since been surpassed by tons many of which yeah exactly but yeah but like I think at the time it was around or over 20 million so

**SPEAKER_05:**
[37:14] yeah that's that's right and interestingly in the course of the sale and maybe a little bit having to do with the sale um the price of bitcoin starts to go down so i believe it's 600 or so at the start of the sale and it's just it's kind of we notice it dropping um
[37:29] kind of continually, I guess. And maybe at the end of it, it's like high fours, low fives, and you know, it's foreshadowing, it'll kind of go on to drop from there. But yeah, okay. So did you guys remember the experience of the funding site and all that sort of thing? I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.
[37:52] I remember the sites. I remember the clock on it, but I don't remember too much else about it. Yeah. Okay, so the crowd sale is not a huge part of your memory. It's a huge part of mine, I guess, because we were dealing with all of the issues. But Vic, you were just getting kind of interested at this time, right? Well, yeah, exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[38:26] well Jim like Jim basically when he he was going to buy this Bitcoin he was like oh I'm going to buy this Bitcoin and to participate in the crowd sale do you want to participate and I was like
[38:41] um you know I'm gonna feel like a real idiot if I don't do anything so I just it was just some yeah we were just going to say like some nominal amount that we did and you know of course it's probably turned into the best investment I ever made but like yeah it was we have pulled our resources together because it was so hard
[39:02] it wasn't easy right you're like generating this yeah exactly seed phrases you know this that and the other it just was mind-bogglingly complicated you know so um and but like I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual Bitcoin like you know I mean Jim was in the Bay Area right the heart of IT and all attack things you know I was in Vancouver and it wasn't Vancouver was an early Bitcoin Adopter but it was still really really hard

**SPEAKER_05:**
[40:12] to find anyone who would be willing to sell you Bitcoin yeah yeah um that's very interesting um yes in any case um the okay so the sale happens and now the project is funded and it's really funded you know um
[40:27] I suppose, you know, there are plenty of mega VC investments at that time, but it's, you know, the bubble years in, you know, 2020, 2021 were not heard of at this time. Like, you know, Series A investments were still between like three and 10 million bucks. Salaries probably a little lower than they are now back then. This was a lot of money. And so the Ethereum folks then kind of
[40:53] It was very technically driven. They kicked in all of their technical dreams, so to speak. So Jim's point about the really big claims, they really were, in a sense, trying to create a whole new internet. A couple examples. So not just the proliferation of
[41:09] clients, they're going to make a browser, the Mist browser. They're going to make a peer to peer messaging system called Whisper. They're going to make a decentralized file storage system. They chose to make a virtual machine like Java. And we always thought that JavaScript was the better analogy because it kind of won on the Internet. Has anyone ever seen an applet in the last 15, 20 years?
[41:36] um but they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM um and you know there's some benefits to that it's definitely evolved over time uh I don't know do you have a more specific memory of like they were making a lot of stuff it was can you get into the experience of trying to make something compatible with what they were doing at that time

**SPEAKER_02:**
[42:15] Well, once I found the yellow paper, it wasn't as difficult because that centered me around the blockchain part of it. But it was that earlier marketing material that was very confusing to me because they would talk about, you know, you would have these videos like, what is Ethereum? And then it would just go off into all these things like you mentioned, a browser, a messaging system. And I think there was even some talk in there about replacing TCP IP or something. I can't remember some of these things.
[42:50] actually came into being, some of these didn't. I think my learning process was first realizing what blockchain was, but then digging a little deeper and being confused that I didn't really know what was happening because I thought this was going to be a blockchain project and then they were talking about writing browsers.
[43:08] and then and then realizing when i saw the yellow paper that yeah this is the core of what ethereum is that other stuff is sort of like pipe dream stuff that may or may not come to being but uh but yeah so that's how it went and then then once i got the the concrete uh um uh testnet uh work that then i understood what was going on so gotcha yeah yeah it was um

**SPEAKER_05:**
[43:38] was wild uh so and i i'm struggling to remember the timing on all of this um actually no i'll go to um i'll go to kind of crypto economicon first um and then uh so now we're going into january or so 2015.
[43:54] So a couple times, so Vitalik visits the Bay Area a bunch. Did you remember, we went to a couple meetups with Vitalik, did we not? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[44:16] um i think he's super casual i remember it's it's funny because like now now he's he's famous but but in those days we would just sort of like hang out with him after the meetings and and uh he would uh kind of like go and bum a uh uh you know like a couch to sleep on in the night one time we like drove him to somebody that he found a couch to sleep on just uh fun casual times yeah yeah there was i think he so he won the teal fellowship so there were like beds there and i have a memory of uh

**SPEAKER_05:**
[45:12] I think we drove. There was a meet up in like the South Bay, and like you drove them into the city or or something like that. It was a crypto castle in sf at that time that we occasionally visited. It's all could hang out there. You know it was. I imagine he's still, you know.
[45:29] really has his little need for creature comforts i'm sure he could procure whatever he likes but um you know it was uh it was funny times probably some really nice coaches nowadays you know really nice yeah um but um so i can't even remember quite how we got the idea but we were talking about
[45:48] For whatever reason, a bunch of people were going to be in the Bay Area late January 2015. And we decided to, and I had also, so through Steve, through Ben Lorica, who's a great guy, who was at the time sort of the, I think it was head of data science, but also really the kind of head of content for O'Reilly's conferences and that sort of thing.
[46:13] we booked a conference um at fort mason and i had a co-host named lauren lance uh also running a crypto startup these days i believe uh also a great guy um and
[46:27] We so given that the conference was on the calendar, and we knew a bunch of people in part for the conference. But I think something else was going on, too, would be in the Bay Area at that time. We decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference that week, which we named
[46:45] the verbose crypto economicon um I think the term crypto economics either was invented or popularized by Vitalik there's also this guy named uh Vlad it's Zampier I don't know quite how to pronounce his last name um uh who's working a lot with Vitalik on proof of stake and other things and went on to start his own I think fairly successful crypto project the name of which is currently escaping me
[47:15] Well, he went through proof of stake for a long time, right? He did. Yeah, I think he did it for the foundation for a while, but then started his own thing sometime later.
[47:26] funny guy but he would say like crypto economics is it crypto or is it economics um and it certainly never really stuck but that was the theme of the conference so we had like two academic track days and a business track day um I believe and we had a bunch of speakers
[47:39] one of whom you know who spoke at the O'Reilly meeting and then would also speak at crypto economicon um the the building we did it in um so we were uh it was co-hosted with a company called coinify which I don't believe exists anymore um a nice guy named Tom Ding but I guess Tom Ding had like some good

**SPEAKER_00:**
[48:23] you know plugins for capital and access with the Chinese government like like the the do you remember the details around who owned that building I think it was some construction conglomerate I remember going like what like what does this have to do with tech at all like it was just yeah that's that's the thing I that's the thing I remember most about it
[48:45] so yes in this circuit I just want to say I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference too we met each other in we'd already been having conversations online I think like because you guys would get together and we'd like chat sometimes but we'd never actually met each other in person um until that conference yeah it was like a month or two or three in I think at that time yeah

**SPEAKER_05:**
[49:26] um and it was like uh it was a cast of characters like the the o'reilly conference is a little more shiny corporate um yeah not three four hundred attendees something like that pretty pretty successful uh the
[49:38] the crypto economics conference was great but kind of crazy like there was a guy whose name is escaping me in these like smart guy very tight bike shorts and he kept like raising his hand and you know I think he had like a defense background um I'm trying to IBM had a big speaking slot at the time they were they were promoting ethereum plus some other Technologies as like the key to their IOT stack

**SPEAKER_00:**
[50:17] I'm trying to even remember okay I actually looked this up so the the participants like it was a very small group of people like I think 20 25 but in the among that group of people was so yeah Vlad who did proof of stake was there Vitalik was there you know Gavin was there who was working on a theorem but later went on to do polka dot Dominic who went to do you know internet computer was there yeah
[50:47] um i think jay jay kwan jay kwan was there who you know went off to do cosmos like a bunch of bitcoin core devs were there um you know it was it was just a crazy group of people to be like like if you looked at the amount of talent like i know people talk about the paypal mafia that was like the crypto mafia right like it was like everyone who went off you know almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project
[51:09] and but there was like i remember being in that room and kind of like we'd started talking and i was really starting on my journey about learning about ethereum and i was just completely baffled like i spent probably 90 of the right time on wikipedia like trying to figure out like what does the byzantine generals problem have to do with technology
[51:28] why are they talking about this you know like or or you know like snarks what are starts like you know I remember like look at like trying to madly keep up with these things but it was just being in that room was exciting like you could it was the first time that I ever totally clicked in that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform
[51:46] and yeah then 2016 day happened after a series of changing dates, because we were like, hey, you know, we want to launch this company, but we need, you know, we were still connected to the hopefully the live net at the time. And so we were like trying to time our thing. And they were like changing dates all the time, too. And so I think the 2016 date was like the sort of last one before they kind of changed their mind and refocused.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[52:37] there were many eras which everyone has copied since there's like this is the what were all the names the Serenity after it launched there's like Metropolis Serenity you know um they were like Epochs where like there would be testing of the software uh and they intended to stay in testnet for quite a long time that's the upshot and I think they ended up like crediting some of the testnet mind ether like one to ten again or
[53:12] 10 to 1 against uh really there's a 10 of the value uh for the people who mind on the testnet so they made it kind of progressively more real but it it really was fortuitous that there was that price crash because we might never have seen it might have never seen the light of day so many of the I I think you you didn't even elucidate like all of the projects like there was a Raspberry Pi clay that
[53:40] I forgot about the Raspberry Pi there were like so many projects like it was like we're like what is going on here you know like they built you know okay so there were many different I think I said um there was serpent which was the python-like language that compiled EVM
[54:01] There's Solidity, which won. Sorry, C++ lost, but Solidity won. And Solidity was kind of put together by Gavin. It's sort of a C JavaScript-looking language.
[54:12] There was another one. LLL was like a Lisp-like language. To some extent, it let the developers just be free to do things that developers always want to do, like build peer-to-peer messaging systems, write compilers. Like do DSLs. Exactly, yeah.
[54:29] Yeah, that was that was funny. OK, let's go to because we can get close to wrapping up here. And, you know, if if there's interest, we could do another one of these because there's lots after the launch. Let's go to kind of right before the launch. OK, so as we're talking about the launch run up, a bunch of interesting things happened. One, we had started to some extent working as part of consensus.
[54:53] So we kind of joined the company and they functioned sort of as an incubator basically for us and plenty of other firms, concepts, some of which stayed in-house, some of which also spun out. Brooklyn was awesome too. I had never been to Williamsburg, Bushwick, and it was sort of moving in various locations there. So I used to love coming and hanging out at the offices.
[55:14] yeah it was uh consensus got the the famous office on Bogart but first was at an office by the water in Williamsburg it was like something it was in Greenport I remember getting completely lost at one point in finding it and like yeah Williamsburg

**SPEAKER_02:**
[56:17] is great. I remember, I remember like sitting there one day and all of a sudden everybody came screaming in and they were filming an episode of girls outside. And so I ran outside and watched them film an episode of girls or part of an episode of girls, not the whole episode.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[56:38] wow yeah that was so okay so that's earlier it wasn't that March April yeah I think it was April May kind of thing well we moved into the Bogart office um just before the launch of ethereum in fact we we one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon right right okay yeah I do remember that um

**SPEAKER_05:**
[57:12] So you know so we're frantically building the software um we're starting to work with people from within um consensus so we had um some folks uh you know uh join the project some of whom have gone on to you know big blockchain success should we tell the the Tim story

**SPEAKER_00:**
[57:34] well yeah I mean Tim the founder of uh Truffle helped us kind of build our first blockchain Explorer you know I mean he was a brilliant developer back then and still remains a brand developer um Aaron I think helped us kind of uh he who went on to build metamask uh you know we had lots of conversations with him about how to um create our rust API and how it would work

**SPEAKER_05:**
[58:14] I met up a couple of times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also. It was funny. These folks would just come by, and now they're sort of different levels of a big deal. Yeah, exactly. I feel like you should tell the hard-hitting version of the TIBS story, just a little bit, because it was funny in retrospect, right? Well, I think the thing is that we were really focused on, at the time, I think the first idea that we had with Block Apps was that we would create a REST API

**SPEAKER_00:**
[58:49] um and we you know i i come from sort of a lean startup background like we really want to push deadlines and at the time people were more in an exploration mode they were trying to do different things and i was kind of ratcheting up the pressure to kind of present this at some at
[59:08] I don't know if it was a conference or some meetup in a particular night and you know as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that people were like you know I think I want to kind of pursue my other interests instead of like working in this high pressure environment and you know like and a lot of early consensus was like that like it was like different working styles and different methodologies but in the end it was kind of amazing like you know the people who did stuff

**SPEAKER_05:**
[59:46] yeah I would say uh lots of really smart people um and a lot of flow between projects it was amorphous at the beginning um there was a lot of excitement but it was also hard to like get someone who was your assigned to your team to like do the thing you expected um well that's the thing is that there weren't team assignments right like there weren't the teams I mean we had

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:00:23] we they were suggested you know exactly like and but you know people were just flowing in and out which is great for creativity but was hard when you were trying to make a deadline because you know when you're trying to make a deadline there's always sort of not great things to have to do right like you gotta work really long hours and that kind of stuff

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:00:46] yeah and um let me see what I felt um so we kind of we looked and saw um you know in our early approach some success at API companies like chain.com was at the time touting a big list of customers that use their API they then pivoted to a couple other things a more Enterprise Outlook and then they kind of
[1:01:13] a little bit pivoted back and then we're you know eventually bought by sort of bought by Stellar I believe um so there's some precedent for like okay let's let's have an API let's make this really easy um for people to use and this being you know the ethereum network itself

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:01:32] And I think we found pretty strong resistance to this idea. Do you want to talk more about this? I think while you guys were working on the client, what I was trying to do was build smart contract based applications, right?
[1:01:46] it was really like you described some of the tooling right which was missed and like for front ends and um you know the languages were constantly changing like a lot of this seemed to be an afterthought like okay we're gonna solve that later on them the puzzle but it was impossible to build an application share it around um just get something running quickly you know and so we like
[1:02:13] you know my background was like web and mobile startups and like the first thing you look for is a rust API and I thought like okay if if we're ever gonna get this ecosystem were to really work we need to have something like that so people can build these applications on you know we couldn't cobble together all these tools but yeah we got a lot of resistance to it um because you know it was like we were speaking Martian to people like these are people but they

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:02:46] had no like um interest in like anything that sounded a little bit corporatey so yeah it wasn't even corporate it was more like like you know like there was a general suspicion of servers i remember the phrase like yeah i don't know if i want to work anything on anything that involves any servers i remember at the time you know

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:03:08] like a peer-to-peer network it's like every peer is both a client and a server like you know it's sort of kind of intrinsic you know yeah there was a lot of belief in the time that effectively everyone would run a node and like you know like at some point you'd run a node in your browser or run a node on your phone and I'm like look I ran a mobile application company like
[1:03:32] I know how big these clients are like I don't want my first thing's gonna get very hot yeah exactly like burning my ass you know sitting in my pocket trying to mine ether right so but yeah it was just very strange though these kind of conversations yeah

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:03:52] and kind of uh concurrently so more aligned with our perspective uh consensus sort of grew an enterprise team which focused sort of on advising big corporates on blockchain and then implementing it for them um and we kind of worked with them on go to market um even before the launch of ethereum more after uh so we kind of hold on that discussion um

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:04:23] maybe for a subsequent episode. But OK, what about, do you guys have any specific memories of the hackathons we did? So the first hackathon we did was in Greenpoint. And we basically, it was sort of internal to consensus people. And I think it was mostly interns that had participated. We had a very crude version of our API working. And it was really,
[1:04:52] um you know like I think over I think over uh a 48 hour period no one could build anything basically like it was like um
[1:05:03] But I think the premise that people were coming up with to use our API to build stuff, we could see some potential in it. So people were doing interesting things like incentivizing location-based scavenger hunts and other kinds of things. And we found that interesting enough that, and I think that was in May, June of 2015 by that time. And then we figured out that the launch would probably happen
[1:05:32] in august of that year and we're like okay let's
[1:05:36] take off all the input we got from that hackathon and do like a real hackathon, like get a bunch of participants, get a bunch of people involved and try and get all the people from ConsenSys, but people outside ConsenSys involved. And we were kind of like targeting that day. So we were like furiously trying to make our product more stable and work and take all the input we got from that first one into the second one.
[1:06:03] when we didn't know exactly I think the plan was to do it on the day of the launch of ethereum and but we didn't know the exact date yet so we're just furiously right before or right after I can't remember I I think it was right after yeah I think it was like two days after or something like that but you know it was it was in the same timing of the launch basically so I re you know as far as I'm aware that was like the first ethereum hackathon
[1:06:32] I remember maybe it was the second or third one. We met the crane brothers. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's where they, uh, I think that was the one right after the lawn. That was, yeah, that was later. They won, didn't they? Um, they didn't won the one at the launch they won. So that hackathon where we met them was actually the first, um, consensus conference hackathon.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1:07:26] I don't think that's true. I think that one was later. Oh, no, you're right.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:07:38] You're right. You're right. I think they came to the first. You're right. I think they came to that very first hackathon. Yeah. So I think or at least John did. Well, maybe. Yeah, they came to the second one, the first one right after the launch. Right. The this is funny. This is another foreshadowing for a future episode. But yes, the IBM, you know, they've been circling this this whole time and they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the consensus hackathon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:08:24] um like i remember us furiously and and just the uncertainty of the launch i was like i remember we had many many conversations like is this thing ever gonna launch like we weren't sure if it would happen yeah do you remember okay let's talk quickly about the mining um that we did um and this was all for the company you know um but
[1:08:52] um do you do you recall uh what we we did at that time yeah I totally remember so I remember well at some point up to the launch we realized okay if we were going to help um if we were going to help businesses or other groups build applications on ethereum we would need ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions and so
[1:09:16] we're like well where are we going to get this ether from and you know I think the first thing that happened was you guys were like oh we need to build a mining rig right now I thought over to you Jim I think that was so Karen and I drove up to fries and picked up a bunch of components we did and you know we were kind of ready for it because we I believe we had you had helped me build just like a workstation

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:10:03] Yeah, I think that's right. Or two before. Basically, like the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation. So it's made a big productivity difference. We went back and yeah, I think so. I moved closer to campus at that time. We took a couple of different shots at mining. But what did you know? I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1:10:34] mine exploded the power supply blew up the graphics card was actually okay something happened to yours i can't remember but we got it going eventually but the part that was funny i remember is that we spent like two or three days building these machines getting it up putting the software on getting it running hitting some problems and uh it started like

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:11:05] ether started to dribble in at that point in time so we're like oh this is awesome and then we called up Victor and he's like yeah in the last half hour I just like spun up a few machines at Amazon and I'm getting as much ether as you guys are well it was more than a few machines so like I remember watching you guys build this and like thinking like oh like this is good launch any day now right like so like I I said like can someone give me an image
[1:11:35] of the go client so and I took that image and I just like put it on Amazon and a bunch of spot instances and at some point I was like running like and I just bought as many spot instances as were available like what whatever meant my price I bought and this was before you know mining was even known that this was something that happened so I could still get it pretty cheap
[1:12:03] and they're warranted the blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast if you were starting none of this is stuff you could do today in fact none of this exactly and it stopped being effective like i mean there were like i remember at the point of the launch i you guys were saying yeah we got our first ether and i was like do you see this graph like you know this is the total mining power of the ethereum network that large wedge which was like 25 is me it's
[1:12:36] God, we should have cranked it up just like another couple of weeks longer. I know. Well, I think by the time, you know, three days have passed, I passed like several thousand dollars. Like our AWS bill was like... Yeah, it seems super expensive at the time. It seemed super expensive at the time. And like, I was like, oh, wow, like this is good. But yeah, I should have ran it like, you know, a month basically. And then it was pretty amazing. Because like...

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:13:24] I yeah I'm not a devops guy but I was like running hundreds of machines at a time and it was just amazing one thing I I struggled to remember how did they communicate that the network was ready to launch this is like Twitter email like how did we even know like we kind of knew I think it was like we knew from the commits that it was close this is why I brought it up before they're like okay they're slowing down they're getting ready you know but

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1:14:03] I don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty into, uh, involved in consensus at those days and everybody was talking about it. And there were like multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining. And so there was no, there was no missing it at the time. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:14:26] yeah sorry like like I said I think there was but like I think they had announced the date but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not right and it turned out they did like that did turn out to be the date but like everyone was kind of gearing up but we were also like getting ready oh you know it might not happen that day it might be a couple days later it could be a couple months later we just weren't sure yeah oh man those

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:15:23] Those are some times for sure. Yeah. Okay. So I think this is a good wrapping point for this first episode. Hopefully we'll see if we get any feedback from the Internet at large, whether we should keep going down this path. But, you know, quite the journey already. Lots of interesting things I've even remembered, you know, in the course of our couple hours here.
[1:15:43] Thanks, guys. It does feel like we should keep going with the story, but we'll see. Let's leave it as a cliffhanger, all of the excitement to come. Any final words?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1:16:02] well I I think you know it's funny even if you look at the beginning you see the same patterns now where there's this like huge amount of inflow and then you know what seemed at the time like tons of hype but now is like a trickle of hype and and what seems like tons of capital but now would be considered a trickle of capital
[1:16:25] and then like a kind of overconfidence and then you know a tightening but then you know real technical stuff gets done into tightening it's funny how that pattern has played out so couple times now yeah exactly we'll tell you about the time we saw Vitalik through his shirt at someone

**SPEAKER_05:**
[1:16:47] Oh, that's a good story. Yes, it's our short story is a good one. All right. Let's let's end it here. Thanks, guys. You know, we're doing this recording on a Sunday. Hope it entertains and informs the wider world. And we'll see you next time.
