**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] Alrighty. So we're on. Thanks. My name is Karen James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from SDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together, called block apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride, you know, that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. And so we wanted to kind of get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity, and here we are.

So with that said, I'll kinda take the lead on the discussion, but we you know, we're we're not trying to be formal here. Trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes.

Alrighty. So let's start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?

I'll give my answer to start, and there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware I'm gonna say 2010, possibly 2011, so this would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and, you know, looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. You know, if you ask me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and, you know, digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

So, that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:35] When were you first aware of Bitcoin slash Where is different than, like, interested? In fact, like, I I don't know. I was like I I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But but I was, like, a little bit too too above all that. Like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm I'm not interested in that money world. So, really, no. Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, was a, an old friend of mine and that Kieran had been following his blog. And and, Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so, at first, I was like, yeah. You know, I'm not interested in all this this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper. And by the end of the white paper, I was I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about, like, banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet, and that drew me in. So and at that point, I I and there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I I started, like, trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they and and at the time, it was a test net. And, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there.

So, well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:34] Yeah. Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological, so I you know, 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you. I think, we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and talk in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:48] But let's let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you wanna take it? Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was, like, all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast, security now, which went really deep into these kind of like, security technical kind of things. And he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin. And I was, like, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin or if I did, I did notice it. The strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be, like, groups of computers in, like, part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can, like, transfer money and, like, it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was like, I I honestly was were kind of repelled by that. Like, that kind of seemed, like, too nutty even for me at the time.

Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:39] I never hated it. I was sort of just, like, not that interested, I guess. You know, from the East Coast, the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think, Jimmy, would long since been out in California doing, like, yeah, you know, after your physics days. But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda like, I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

I I didn't hate it, but I think

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:03] I found the like everyone talked about so I was fascinated the technical aspect, like I said. Like, you know, I and it got me to read the white paper and even, like, download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they're like they were, like, kind of fanatical. Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

Yeah. Jim, I would say

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:26] Yeah. The people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it, but yeah, I I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most successful in some sense people at that time. Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics or or something. It's just like the most horsepower wins from a intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in, you know, crypto blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Benet, etcetera. But, yeah, I think I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

Yeah. I I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:45] sketchy because most of the use cases that like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case? Why would you use it? And people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws. Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff. And I was like, is that legal? And, like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:38] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:42] Well, I I wanna say I never hated it. I was sort of just, like, not that interested, I guess. You know, from the East Coast, the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think, Jimmy, would long since been out in California doing, like, yeah, you know, after your physics days. But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda like, I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

I see. I I didn't hate it, but I think

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:36] I got over feeling too good for it. I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:43] Yeah. And we all did it. Yeah. I I wanna touch on the other the big thing that sticks out of my memory from the the early blockchain era is and and we've kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox Mhmm. Was that first big price run up? I believe Bitcoin went from, like, $30 to $1,200 in Yep. A pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price, and people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in, and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top. You know? And, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side. And then sort of the crypto is somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be, you know, quite sound. But I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone lots of people I knew who were not quite

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:26] crypto savvy in the industry, etcetera, were suddenly paying attention when was happening. With the hot topic just getting into things. Yeah. I I what year was it? Was it 2015, 2014? 2014, probably. Right? I think docs was 13. Let me check. Yeah. I think was 13. Yeah. Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that it was still I was observing it as a, you know, like, a third party. You know? It was interesting to me. But but yeah, I I think I I spent a little time to understand what because, you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn't explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was, oh, there's

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:13] I think you're right. So the run up was actually '13 into the '14, it looks like. Or okay. So it officially shuttered February. Though and the big the 1200 that I remember was, like, November 2013,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[20:35] it looks like. When did the hack happen? December. Oh, it happened. Right here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Happened right there. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:46] So yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think MonkDocs and oh, what was I'm blanking right now. What what was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road? Silk Road. Yeah. Like, I think it's those were kind of intertwined in those early days. Right? So I remember, like, even you going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kinda shocked with what I saw listed there. Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was list listed there. You know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:38] Wow. You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at length. I had an account and some others. There's a period where like was doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped. And I I believe they're still around as, like, a payment API company.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:06] Yeah. Because I I remember them and some others. I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was, like, the sort of, you know, as we've as you mentioned, like, the first kind of iteration of, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then and then it just keeps coming back. Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:37] Yeah. It sure does.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:40] Okay. There's a little bit of bias in the new the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. Like, if if there's if there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person. So it's always, like, much more tied into you know, the the price of of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don't see, like, crashing because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess fraud's big enough.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[23:41] Yeah. Agreed. Just segue does happen sometimes. Yeah. Segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all yeah. Jim, do do I do I wanna start, or do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:03] I'll start, and and I'll pass it over. I actually so I had, back in the nineties, was in academia in the aughts. I was, in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups. And I was ending one of my startups, and I had two sons who were in the our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school. And I at this time, there was just a coincidence both my wife and I, had ended jobs. And we said, hey. Let's just been crazy right now, and and let's let's take this to its extension. Let's let's go to China and actually put them in a school there. So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing. And he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys. So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now, and you can explain.

Well yeah. And and so the VC,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[25:36] you know, who we're still friends with, like, he kinda came up to me, and he he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So you know what? Don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started talking that summer, and you weren't, like, traveling in the country, so you were, like, in a different place every couple of advantage of us both

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:09] being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[26:15] And and I remember, like, you know, like, we were kinda talking over the summer, and I was, like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point, you said, okay. Look. If you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing. And I went to the school that my kids went to, which and said, like, you know, can you make space for, you know, two foreign kids, this international program? They said, yes. If you can but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called Jim up and said, look. I can do it. You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day. And to my shock, he actually said yes, and he like, parked up his house and, like, you know, he turned off packed everything in the house in, like I think we had twelve days to be in school, and we probably were

**SPEAKER_01:**
[27:35] the had to have the house back within, like, I don't know, less than a week. So Yeah. That was a crazy week. But but Victor was a great help in like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything. And he knew where the good schools were. He knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:15] So Yeah. It was a great experience. It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics. You know? Like, it was right around that the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time. But yeah, you wound up staying for about eighteen months, right, in total? And A little less, but, yeah, it was it was over a year. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:41] Let me I'll segue. I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. Mhmm. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically, the I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm gonna say, 2014 or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who have not, not aware of how, PhD program works, qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. So sometimes there's a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like, an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency. I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point. And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley. It's a three hour oral exam with couple people from your department and one from an external department, and then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was like that. Right? Yeah. It's it's a oral. It's subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got, like, several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects. So they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.

So anyways, so the qualifying exam led to you know, I I needed, like, a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics, and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking I can't quite remember. So something having to do with, like, Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I I can't can't remember at this time. But, you know, it seemed like a okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York. And, you know, as as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it. I still, you know, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kinda like it there.

But anyway That's by the way. Yes. Yes. Jim's there. I'm I'm in the state of New York at the moment. But but yeah. But I, know, I need a little break basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow, my you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow. My dad, Joe got attached to the project basically because he was always he was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years. And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the, you know, blockchain philosophical character, in that, you know, let's say, pro pro freedom, little little bit of a libertarian streak kinda thing.

And I believe he happened to just be visiting our family. So he's from Toronto. A lot of, a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And you know, like everyone around that time where you you see that Alex speak about something, you got really excited. Right? And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project and, you know, it didn't turn out that way. We can go into it, a little bit later. But he started working on it again, let's say, February, March 2014. And so he just sent me the white paper, like, right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam. I got a chance to read it, and it was pretty cool and interesting and new. And it was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etcetera. And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer basically. So that's how I got into it.

And subsequently, you know, Jim Jim alluded to this earlier, I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Shu, a great great friend of ours. Kind of I don't know. Not not quite famously brilliant. Definitely brilliant, somewhat famous. Super cool guy, and I'd I'd been a longtime reader of Steve's blog. He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time, I don't know, distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience, but Steve is actually good at that, and with Nuance coverage of technical topics. So anyway, caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.

And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe Janu or sorry, June, July 2014. And maybe I came back in August or or something like that. And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in Hayward, and we got to meet up.

I wonder if you did anything. August 2014, September, something like that? Oh, it was around then because,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[36:58] also, ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back. That's weird. Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip. You do a Obviously. Soul searching. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[37:16] Cross country.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[37:18] Yeah. Will Williamsburg is great. I remember, like, sitting there one day, and all of a sudden, everybody came screaming in, and and they were filming an episode of girls outside. And so I ran outside and watched them film an episode of girls or part of an episode of girls, not the whole episode.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[37:41] Yeah. That was so okay. So that's

**SPEAKER_02:**
[37:45] early. Was it at March, April? That was around yeah. I think it was April, May kind of thing.

We moved into the Bogart office just before the launch of Ethereum. In fact, we one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[38:16] Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. I do remember that. So we're frantically building the software. We're starting to work with people from within consensus. So we had some folks, you know, join the project, some of whom have gone on to, you know, big blockchain success.

Should should we tell the the Tim story?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[38:41] Well, yeah. I mean, Tim, the founder of truffle, helped us kind of build our first blockchain explorer. You know? I mean, he was a brilliant developer back then and still remains a brilliant developer.

Aaron, I think helped us kind of he who went on to build MetaMask. You know, we had lots of conversations with him about how to create our REST API and how it would work.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[39:15] I met up a couple times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also, it was funny, like these folks would just come by and now they're like sort of different levels of a big deal. Exactly. I feel like you should tell the hard hitting version of the tips story just so, you know, a little bit because it was funny in retrospect.

Right? Well, I I think the thing is that we were really focused on at the time,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[39:45] I think the first idea that we had with block apps was that we would create like a REST API. And we you know, I I come from sort of a lean startup background. Like, we really want to push deadlines. And at the time, people were more in an exploration mode. They were trying to do different things. And I was kind of ratcheting up the pressure to kind of present this at some I don't know if it was a conference or some meetup in a particular night. And you know, as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that, people were like, you know, I think I wanna kind of pursue my other interests instead of, like, working in this high pressure environment.

And, you know, like a lot of early consensus was like that. Like, it was like different working styles and different methodologies. But in the end, it was kind of amazing, like, you know, the the people who did stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[41:25] Yeah. I would say lots of really smart people and a lot of flow between projects. It was amorphous at the beginning. Yeah. There was a lot of excitement, but it was also hard to like get someone who is your assigned to your team to do the thing you expected.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[41:46] Well, it doesn't mean it's that there weren't team assignments. Right? Like, there weren't the teams I mean, we had they were suggested.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[41:57] You know? Exactly. Like

**SPEAKER_02:**
[42:00] and and but, you know, people were just flowing in and out, which is great for creativity, but was hard when you were trying to make a deadline because, you know, when you're trying to make a deadline, there's always sort of not great things you have to do. Right? Like, you gotta work really long hours and that kind of stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[42:25] Yeah. And let me see. So we kind of we looked and saw, you know, in our early approach some success at API companies. Like, chain.com was at the time touting a big list of customers that use their API. They then pivoted to a couple other things, more enterprise outlook, and then they kinda a little bit pivoted back and then were, you know, eventually bought by sort of bought by Stellar, I believe. So there's some precedent for okay. Let's let's have an API. Let's make this really easy for people to use, and this being, you know, the Ethereum network itself.

And I think we found pretty

**SPEAKER_02:**
[43:17] strong resistance to this idea. Oh, yeah. Do you do you wanna talk more about you know, this stuff? I I think while you guys were working on the client, what I was trying to do was build like smart contract based applications. Right? And it was really like you you described some of the tooling, right, which was missed and like for front ends and, you know, the languages were constantly changing. Like a lot of this seemed to be an afterthought, like okay, we're gonna solve that later on them, the puzzle.

But it was impossible to build an application, share it around, just get something running quickly, you know, and so we like, you know, my background was like web and mobile startups and like the first thing you look for is a REST API, and I thought like okay if we're ever gonna get this ecosystem were to really work we need to have something like that so people can build these applications on. You know? We couldn't cobble together all these tools.

But yeah, we got a lot of resistance to it because you know people we were speaking Martian to people. Like these are people but they had no like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[45:27] interest in, like, anything that sounded a little bit corporate y. So

**SPEAKER_02:**
[45:36] Yeah. It wasn't even corporate y. It was more like like there was a general

**SPEAKER_00:**
[45:41] suspicion of servers.

I remember the phrase like, yeah. I don't know if I wanna work anything on anything that involves any servers. And I I remember at the time, you know, like a peer to peer network, it's like every peer is both a client and a server. Like, you know, it's it's sort of kind of intrinsic.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[46:13] You know? Yeah. There was a lot of belief in the time that effectively everyone would run a node. And like at some point, you'd run a node in your browser or run a node on your phone. And I'm like look. I ran a mobile application company. Like, I know how big these clients are. Like, I don't want my things gonna get very hot. Yeah. Exactly. Like burning my ass, you know, sitting in my pocket trying to mine ether.

Right? So but yeah, it was just very strange, though, these kind of conversations.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[46:52] Yeah. And kind of concurrently so more aligned with our perspective consensus sort of grew an enterprise team which focused sort of on advising big corporates on blockchain and then implementing it for them. And we kinda worked with them on go to market even before the launch of Ethereum more after.

So we kinda hold on that discussion maybe for a subsequent episode. But okay. What about do you guys have any specific memories of the hackathons we did?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[47:35] So the first hackathon we did was in Greenpoint, and we basically it was sort of internal to consensus people, and I think it was mostly interns that kind of participated. We had a very crude version of our API working, and it was really you know like over I think over a forty eight hour period, no one could build anything, basically. Like but I think the premise that people were coming up with to use our API to build stuff we could see some potential in it.

So like people are doing, you know, interesting things like incentivizing location based scavenger hunts and other kind of things. And we found that interesting enough that you know and I think this that was in May, June 2015 by that time. And then we figured out that there was you know a week the launch would probably happen in August of that year.

And we're like okay let's take of all the input we got from that hackathon and do it like a real hackathon. Like get a bunch of participants, get a bunch of people involved, and you know try and get all the people from consensus but people outside consensus involved. And we were kind of targeting that day. So we were like furiously trying to make our product more stable and work and take all the input we got from that first one into the second one.

When we didn't know exact I think the plan was to do it on the day of the launch of Ethereum, and but we didn't know the exact date yet. So we're just furiously You said right before or right after? I can't remember. I I think it was right after. Yeah. I think it was like two days after or something like that.

But you know, it was it was in the same timing of the launch basically. So I re you know as far as I'm aware, that was like the first Ethereum hackathon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[50:27] I remember maybe it was the second or third one we met the Crane brothers.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[50:36] Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Mhmm. They Yeah. I

**SPEAKER_00:**
[50:41] think that was the one right after the launch. That was, yeah, that was later.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[50:47] That wasn't they? They didn't want the one at the launch. They wanted so that hackathon where we met them was actually the first consensus conference hackathon. I don't think that's true. I think that one was later.

I think they Oh, no. You don't like Yeah. You're right. You're right. I think they came to the first you you're right. I think they came to that very first hackathon. Yeah. So I I think

**SPEAKER_00:**
[51:23] or at least John did. Well, maybe both. Yeah. Yeah. They came to the second one the first one right after the launch.

Right? The yeah. This is funny. This is another foreshadowing for a future episode. But yes, IBM you know they've been circling this this whole time and they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the consensus hackathon.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[51:47] Like I remember us furiously and and just the uncertainty of the launch. I was like I remember we had many, many conversations. Like is this thing ever gonna launch? Like, we weren't sure if it would happen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[52:03] Yeah. Do you remember okay. Let's talk quickly about the mining that we did and this was all for the company. You know? But do you recall what we we did at that time?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[52:17] Yeah. I totally remember. So I remember well, at some point up to the launch, we realized okay if we were gonna help if we were gonna help businesses or other groups build applications on the Ethereum, we would need ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions.

And so you guys were like oh we need to build a mining rig. Right? I'll hand that over to you Jen. I think that was

**SPEAKER_01:**
[52:46] Karen and I drove up to Fry's and picked up a bunch of components.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[52:53] We did. I and, you know, we we're kinda ready for it because we I believe we had you had helped me build just like a workstation

**SPEAKER_01:**
[53:04] Yeah. I think that's right. Or two before.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[53:08] Basically, like the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation. So it's made a big productivity difference. Yeah. We went back and yeah, I I think so I moved closer to campus at that time.

We took a couple different shots at mining but what did you know I I think mine exploded. The power supply blew up. The graphics card was actually okay. I something happened to yours. I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[53:42] Well, we gotta go on eventually. But the part that was funny, I remember, is that we spent like two or three days building these machines, getting it up, putting the software on, getting it running, hitting some problems. And it started like ether started to dribble in at that point in time.

So we're like oh this is awesome and then we called up Victor, and he's like yeah In the last half hour, I just like spun up a few machines at Amazon, and I'm getting as much ether as you guys are. Well, it was more than a few machines. So like I remember watching you guys build this and like thinking oh like this is gonna launch any day now.

Right? Like so like I said, can someone give me an image of the Go client?

So and I took that image, and I just like put it on Amazon and a bunch of Spot instances. And at some point, I was like running like and I just bought as many spot instances as were available. Like whatever met my price I bought, and this was before you know mining was even known that this was something that happened.

So I could still get it pretty cheap, and the blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast even if you were starting None of this is stuff you could do today. In fact, none of this is Exactly.

Well, and and it stopped being effective. Like, I mean, there like I remember at the point of the launch, I you guys were saying yeah We got our first ether And I was like do you see this graph? Like you know this is the total mining power of the Ethereum network That large wedge which was like 25% is me on Spotlight. No.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[56:13] God. We should've we should've cranked it up just another couple weeks longer. I don't.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[56:21] Well, I think by the time you know three days have passed, I'd I'd passed like several thousand dollars. Like our AWS bill was, like Yeah. It seems super expensive at the time. Super expensive at the time. And like I was like oh wow. Like this is good. But yeah, we should've ran it, like, you know, a month basically.

And then it was it was pretty amazing. Because like Yes. I yeah. I'm not a DevOps guy, but I was like running hundreds of machines at a time, and it was just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[57:13] One thing I I struggled to remember how did they communicate that the network was ready to launch? Is it like Twitter email? Like, how did we even know? Like, we knew we kinda knew. I think it was like, we knew from the commits that it was close. This is why I brought it up before. They're like okay. They're slowing down. They're getting ready.

But

**SPEAKER_01:**
[57:38] I don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty into, involved in consensus at those days and everybody was talking about it. Yeah. And there were like multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining.

And so there was no there was no missing it at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[58:01] Yeah. Yeah. This is

**SPEAKER_02:**
[58:04] sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. Like like I said, I think there was but like I think they announced the date, but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not.

Right? And it turned out they did. Like, that did turn out to be the date. But, like, everyone was kind of gearing up, but we were also, like, getting ready. Like oh you know it might not happen that day. It might be a couple days later. It could be a couple months later. We just weren't sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[58:37] Yeah. Oh, man. Those those are some times for sure. Yeah. Okay. So I think this is a good wrapping point for this first episode. Hopefully, we'll see if we get any feedback from the Internet at large on whether we should keep going down this path. But you know quite the journey already. Lots of interesting things I've even remembered in the course of our couple hours here.

Thanks, guys. Does feel like we should keep going with the story but we'll see. You know let's leave it as a cliffhanger all of the excitement to come. Any final words?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[59:14] Well, I I I think you know it is funny even if you look at the beginning, you see the same patterns now where there's this like huge amount of inflow and then, you know, up what seemed at the time like tons of hype but now is like a trickle of hype. And and what seems like tons of capital, but now would be considered a trickle of capital.

And then, like, a kind of overconfidence and then, you know, a tightening, but then, you know, real technical stuff gets done in the tightening. It's funny how that pattern has played out so many times now.

Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[59:48] It's a funny type of cyclical. Tell you about the time we saw Vitalik threw his shirt at someone.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[59:56] Oh, that's a good story. Yes. That is a really good story. The Vitalik shirt story is a good one. Alrighty. Let's let's end it here. Thanks, guys. You know we're doing this recording on a Sunday. Hope it entertains and informs the wider world, and we'll see you next time.
