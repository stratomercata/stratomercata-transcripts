**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Alrighty. So we're on. Thanks. So my name is Karen James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from SDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together, called block apps, which has been in operation for for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride, you know, that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. And so we wanted to kind of, know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for for posterity, and here we are. So with that said, I'll, kinda take the lead on the discussion, but we you know, we're we're not trying to be formal here. Trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes. Alrighty. So let's let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start, and there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware I'm gonna say 2010, possibly 2011, so this would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and, you know, looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. You know, I'd if you ask me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and, you know, digital banking or a pay a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So, that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:02] When were you first aware of Bitcoin slash Where is different than, like, interested? In fact, like, I I don't know. I was like I I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But but I was, like, a little bit too too above all that. Like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm I'm not interested in that money world. So, really, no. Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, was a, an old friend of mine and that Kieran had been following his blog. And and, Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so, at first, I was like, yeah. You know, I'm not interested in all this this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper. And by the end of the white paper, I was I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about, like, banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet, and that drew me in. So, and at that point, I I and there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I I started, like, trying to write code that would, connect to one of the peers and see how they and and at the time, it was a test net. And, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:04] Yeah. Let's, Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological, so I you know, 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you. I think, we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we'll talk in in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:06] But let's let's hold on it for just a a moment. Vic, do you wanna take it? Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was, like, all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast, security now, which went really deep into these kind of, like, security technical kind of things. And he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin. And I was, like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin. Or if I did, I did notice it. I I wish I think the rewards were, like, 50 at the time or something like this. But the the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be, like, groups of computers in, like, part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can, like, transfer money and, like, it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was like, I I honestly was were kind of repelled by that. Like, that kind of seemed, like, too nutty even for me at the time. Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:08] I never hated it. I was sort of just, like, not that interested, I guess. You know, I think, you know, from the East Coast, the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think, Jimmy, would long since been out in California doing, like, yeah, you know, after your physics days. But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda like, I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it. I see. I I didn't hate it, but I think

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:10] I found the like like, everyone talked about so I was fascinated the technical aspect, like I said. Like, you know, I and it got me to read the white paper and even, like, download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they're like they were, like, kind of fanatical. Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say. Yeah. I would say

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:12] the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it, but, yeah, I I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most successful in some sense people at that time, Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics or or something. It's just like the most horsepower wins from a, you know, intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in in, you know, crypto blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Benet, etcetera. But, yeah, I think I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but that, one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess. Yeah. I I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:14] sketchy because most of the use cases that like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case? Why would you use it? And people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws. Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff. And I was like, is that legal? And, like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:16] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:18] Well, I I wanna say I got Sorry. I

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:20] got over feeling too good for it. I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:22] Yeah. And we all did it. Yeah. I I wanna touch on the other the big thing that sticks out of my memory from the the early blockchain era is and and we've kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox Mhmm. Was that first big price run up. I believe Bitcoin went from, like, $30 to $1,200 in Yep. A pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price, and people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in, and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top. You know? And, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side. And then sort of the crypto is somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be, you know, quite sound. But I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone lots of people I knew who were not quite

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:24] crypto savvy in the industry, etcetera, were suddenly paying attention when was happening. With the hot topic just getting into things. Yeah. I I what year was it? Was it 2015, 2014? 2014, probably. Right? I think docs was 13. Let me check. Yeah. I think was 13. Yeah. Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that it was still I was observing it as a, you know, like, a third party. You know? It was it was interesting to me. But but, yeah, I think I I spent a little time to understand what because, you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn't explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but, no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was, it was oh, there's

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:26] I think you're right. So the run up was actually '13 into the '14, it it looks like. Or okay. So it officially shuttered February. Though and the big the 1200 that I remember was, like, November 2013,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:28] it looks like. When did the hack happen? December. Oh, it happened. Right here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Happened right there. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:30] So, yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think MonkDocs

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:32] and oh, what was I'm blanking right now. What what was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road. Silk Road. Yeah. Like, I think it's those were kind of intertwined in those early days. Right? So I remember, like, even you going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kinda shocked with what I saw listed there. Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was list listed there. You know? That's

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:34] wow. You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at length. I had an account, and some others. There's a period where, like, was doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped. And I I believe they're still around as, like, a payment API company. But

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:36] Yeah. Because I I remember them and some others. I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was, like, the sort of, like you know, as we've as you mentioned, like, the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then and then it just keeps coming back. Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:38] Yeah. It sure does.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:40] Okay. There's a little bit of bias in the new the news on how they cover, problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional, world. Like, if if there's if there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person. So it's always, like, much more tied into you know, the the price of of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don't see, like, crashing because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess fraud's big enough. But

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:42] Yeah. Agreed. Just segue does happen sometimes. Yeah. Segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all Yeah. Jim, do do I do I wanna start, or do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:44] I'll start, and and I'll pass it over. I, actually, so I had, back in the nineties, was in academia in the in the aughts. I was, in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups. And I was ending one of my startups, and I had, two sons who were in the our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school. And I, at at this time, there was just a coincidence. Both my wife and I, had ended jobs. And we said, hey. Let's just been crazy right now, and and let's let's take this to to its extension. Let's let's go to China and actually put them in a school there. So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing. And he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys. So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now, and you can explain. Well, yeah. And and so the VC,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:46] you know, who we're still friends with, like, he kinda came up to me, and he he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So you know what? Don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started talking that summer, and you weren't, like, traveling in the country, so you were, like, in a different place every couple of advantage of us both

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:48] being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:50] And and I remember, like, you know, like, we were kinda talking over the summer, and I was, like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point, you said, okay. Look. If you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing. And I went to the school that my kids went to, which and said, like, you know, can you make space for, you know, two foreign kids, this inter international program? They said, yes. If you can but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called Jim up and said, look. I can do it. You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day. And to my shock, he actually said yes, and he, like, parked up his house and, like, you know, he turned off packed everything in the house in, like I think we had twelve days to be in school, and we probably were

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:52] the had to have the house back within, like, less than a week. So Yeah. That was a crazy week. But but Victor was a great help in like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about. Victor had also, moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything. And he knew he knew where the good schools were. He knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:54] So Yeah. It was a great experience. It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics. You know? Like, it was right around that the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time. But, yeah, you wound up staying for about eighteen months, right, in total? And A little less, but, yeah, it was it was over a year. Yeah. And then we just kept in touch from there. Like, we loved working together.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:56] Yeah. It was great. Year did you arrive? Or what was this rough time to your period? Yeah. Who were you asking? Because it was different for me. You, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:58] Oh, 2011. 2011. Twenty eleven summer. We're driving all over the country. 2011, September, August. I can't remember. We were we were in Beijing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:00] Gotcha. Very cool. And so then you're back 2012 or early twenty thirteen, something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:02] Yeah. We were back in the country in 2013. Gotcha. It's about, like, January.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:04] Let me I'll segue. I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep, you know, everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school, at at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. Mhmm. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but, basically, the I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm gonna say, 2014 or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who have not, not aware of how, PhD program works, qualifying exam is, like, one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. So sometimes there's a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like, an academic work from one language to to another to show proficiency. I think, most of them have dropped those requirements, at this point. And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley. It's a three hour oral exam with couple people from your department and one from an external department, and then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was a I don't know that it was it was everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good. Right? Like, and, you know, so while I passed it, I it it was, like, you know, didn't feel great the at least the rest of that day.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:06] But when do you find out the result? Like, is it Immediately. Oh, you do? Okay. They put you in the hall, and they tell you. Yeah. Okay. That's good. So you're just, like, very nervous for I don't know what it was like for you, but for me, it was just, like, three guys I knew. And I I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and, like, calculate numbers or something. They just kinda come out, and they're like, yeah. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:08] Exactly. It no. It was it was like that. Right? Yeah. It's it's a oral. It's subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got, like, several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects. So they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research. So, anyways, so I kind of the qualifying exam led to you know, I I needed, like, a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics, and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking I can't quite remember. So something having to do with, like, Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to, networks. I I can't can't remember at this time. But, you know, it seemed like a okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York. And, you know, as as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it. I still, you know, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kinda like it there. But anyway That's by the way. Yes. Yes. Jim's there. I'm I'm in the state of New York at the moment. But but yeah. But I, know, I need a little break, basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow, my you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow. My dad, Joe got attached to the project basically because he was always he was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years. And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the, you know, blockchain philosophical character, in that, you know, let's say, pro freedom, little little bit of a libertarian streak kinda thing. And I believe he happened to just be visiting our family. So he's from Toronto. A lot of, a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And, you know, like everyone around that time where you you see that Alex speak about something, you got really excited. Right? And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project and, you know, it did didn't turn out that way. We can go into it, a little bit later. But he started working on it again, let's say, February, March, 2014. And so he just sent me the white paper, like, right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam. I got a chance to read it, and it was pretty cool and interesting and new. And it's that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etcetera. And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer, basically. So that's how I got into it. And, subsequently, you know, Jim Jim alluded to this earlier, I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Shu, a great great friend of ours. Kind of I don't know. Not not quite famously brilliant. Definitely brilliant, somewhat famous. Super cool guy, and I'd I'd been a longtime reader of Steve's blog. He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time, I don't know, distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience, but Steve is actually good at that, but with Nuance coverage of technical topics. So, anyway, caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe Janu or sorry, June, July 2014. And maybe I came back in August or or something like that. And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in in Hayward, and we got to meet up I wonder if you did anything. August 2014, September, something like that? Oh, it was around then because,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:10] also, ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back. That's weird. Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip. You do a Obviously. Soul searching. You do a literal search. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:12] Cross country.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:14] Well See, I was in Montana, and then I was back in the Bay Area, and then we talked.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:16] Yeah. Okay. So let's let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start, and there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware I'm gonna say 2010, possibly 2011, so this would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and, you know, looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. You know, I'd if you ask me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and, you know, digital banking or a pay a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So, that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:18] When were you first aware of Bitcoin slash Where is different than, like, interested? In fact, like, I I don't know. I was like I I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But but I was, like, a little bit too too above all that. Like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm I'm not interested in that money world. So, really, no. Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, was a, an old friend of mine and that Kieran had been following his blog.

So that's when I I started, like, trying to write code that would, connect to one of the peers and see how they and and at the time, it was a test net. And, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:20] Yeah. Let's, Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological, so I you know, 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you. I think, we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we'll talk in in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:22] But let's let's hold on it for just a a moment. Vic, do you wanna take it? Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts.

Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say. Yeah. I would say

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:28] the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it, but, yeah, I I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most successful in some sense people at that time, Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics or or something.

A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Benet, etcetera. But, yeah, I think I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but that, one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess. Yeah. I I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:30] sketchy because most of the use cases that like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case? Why would you use it? And people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws. Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff. And I was like, is that legal? And, like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:38] Yeah. And we all did it. Yeah. I I wanna touch on the other the big thing that sticks out of my memory from the the early blockchain era is and and we've kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox Mhmm. Was that first big price run up. I believe Bitcoin went from, like, $30 to $1,200 in Yep. A pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price, and people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in, and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top. You know? And, you know, whether it's outright theft or
