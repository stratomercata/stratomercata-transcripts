<think>
Okay, I need to process this raw transcript and make it clean and readable while preserving all the content. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. The primary goal is to create a clean transcript with all dialogue and content intact. The user provided specific rules, so I need to follow them closely.

First, I'll check the technical terms and proper names. The user listed known people and technical terms. For example, "Vitalik" should be spelled correctly, and terms like "Ethereum" need proper capitalization. I'll go through the transcript to correct any misspellings here.

Next, the timestamps. Every line of dialogue must have a timestamp in [MM:SS] format. I need to ensure that each line is properly timestamped and that the format is consistent. If there are any missing or incorrectly formatted timestamps, I'll fix them.

Then, punctuation and sentence structure. The raw transcript has a lot of run-on sentences and missing punctuation. I'll add periods, commas, and capitalize the first letter of each sentence where necessary. Also, I'll check for any obvious grammatical errors that might affect readability without altering the original meaning.

Paragraph breaks are important for readability. I'll look for natural transitions in the conversation where a new topic is introduced or a speaker changes the subject. Each of these points should be a new paragraph to make the transcript easier to follow.

Filler words like "um," "uh," and "you know" should be minimized but not entirely removed. The user wants the transcript to remain conversational, so I'll only remove these when they're excessive and hinder understanding.

False starts and repetitions need to be addressed. For example, if a speaker says "I was— I mean I was going to say..." I'll correct that to "I was going to say..." to make it smoother without changing the intended message.

I also need to ensure that all technical terms are correctly spelled and capitalized. Terms like "blockchain," "Ethereum," and "Bitcoin" should be properly capitalized. The user provided a list of technical terms, so I'll cross-reference that to make sure everything is accurate.

Proper names from the provided list should be checked. For instance, "Vitalik" should be spelled correctly, and any variations like "Vitalix" should be corrected to the standard form.

The user emphasized preserving all content, so I must avoid summarizing or condensing any part of the discussion. Even if a section seems redundant, it needs to stay. The output length should be approximately the same as the input, so I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the 90-110% range.

I'll also verify that all speaker labels are bolded as **SPEAKER_XX:** and that the timestamps are correctly placed at the start of each line. No speaker names should be used; only the labels provided.

Finally, I'll do a final review to ensure that all corrections have been made without altering the original dialogue. This includes checking for any missed technical terms, proper names, and ensuring the flow of the conversation is natural and readable.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alrighty, so we're on.
Thanks.
So my name is Kieran James Lubin.
I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong.
We are old friends.
We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time.
But that's not what we're here to talk about today.
We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for, for posterity and here we are.
So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion.
But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational.
This is a first of a, you know, Kieran produced podcast of sorts.
I've been on a bunch of them.
I don't think I've ever led one.
So we're going to find out how it goes.
Alrighty, so let's, let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?
I'll give my answer to start.
And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it.
So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011.
So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of bitcoin.
And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15.
I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit.
I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time.
I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.
If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a paypl type provider, that sort of thing.
And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.
So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.
When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Aware is different than like interested.
In fact, like, I don't know, I was like, I came from an academic background so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it.
But, but I was like a little bit too above all that, like, oh, that's like a money thing.
I'm not interested in that money world.
So really, no.
Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is a.
An old friend of mine, and that Kieran had been following his blog.
And Steve called me up and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing.
And so at first I was like, yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this, this fake money thing.
And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was, I was hooked in.
I was like, this isn't just about like, like banking or something.
This is about incentivization on the Internet.
And that drew me in.
So.
And at that point I.
And there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed.
I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked.
So that's when I, I started, like, trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that.
And at the time it was a test net and.
And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there.
So, I don't know.
Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, let's.
Jim, we'll pick that up.
I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological.
So, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like.
Same time frame for you.
I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we'll talk in more detail.
But let's, let's hold on it for just a moment.
Vic, do you want to take it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.
I think I became aware of it around the same time as you.
I was, I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I.
I felt really disconnected from North America.
So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts.
And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was like all technical podcasts.
And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast Security now, which went really deep into these kind of like, security, technical kind of things and did like a couple episodes of bitcoin and I was like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like, and even to the point where I downloaded the bitcoin client and ran it.
Didn't get any bitcoin, where if I did, I didn't notice it.
I wish.
I think the Rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.
But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there'd be like groups of computers in like part of their office.
And I was like, what are those for?
They're like, oh, we're mining bitcoin.
And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining bitcoin?
And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can like transfer money and like, it's basically free Internet magic money.
And I was like, I honestly was kind of repelled by that.
Like, that kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I never hated it.
I was sort of just like not that interested, I guess.
I know.
I think, you know, from the east coast, the attitude towards like stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable.
I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like, yeah, you know, after your physics days.

**SPEAKER_01:**
You're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, like, I guess I didn't hate it.
I just felt I was too good for it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I see.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I hate it.
But I think I found the like, like everyone talked about.
So I was fascinated.
The technical aspect, like I said, like, you know, and it got me to read the white paper and even like download the software.
But I think the part that kind of turned me off about was like when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up bitcoin mining rigs, they're like, they were like kind of fanatical.
Like there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off.
I would say.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto.
Some of them weighed in on it.
But yeah, I think it's sort of.
It was too fringe to attract like the classically most successful in some sense people at that time.
Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs like in math or physics or something.
It's just like the most horsepower wins from a, you know, intellectual perspective and I guess the hardest working horsepower.
Very few of those people got interested in, in, you know, crypto blockchain.
A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as, you know, compared to younger ones like folks like Dan Benet, etc.
But yeah, I think.
I don't know that it was.
That I was too good for it.
But that one I didn't grasp right away.
That it was revolutionary and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.
I would describe my view of it in the early days was sketchy because most of the use cases that, like, I thought the technology was fascinating.
But whenever I would ask about, you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case?
Why would you use it?
And people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws.
Like the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff.
And I was like, is that legal?
And like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Well, I want to say good.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I got over feeling too good for it, I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, we all did.
I want to touch on the other.
The big thing that sticks out of my memory from the early blockchain era is, and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mount Gox.
So Mount Gox was that first big price run up, I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks, 1200 bucks in a pretty short time frame.
And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person to some extent.
Consumer interest tracks with the price and people are getting excited about price momentum.
Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing.
More people come in and it goes all the way up.
And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top, you know, and, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side, sort of.
Crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this.
The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound, but I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mount Gox distinctly?
I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto savvy in the industry, etc, were suddenly paying attention when Mount Gox was happening.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I was just getting into things.
I, I, what year was it?
Was it 2015?
2014?
2014, probably.
Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think docs was 13.
Let me check.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
13.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.
I was new enough to it that it was still, I was observing it as a, you know, like a third party, you know, it was, it was interesting to me.
But, but yeah, I think I, I spent a little time to understand what, because you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it.
They didn't explain what was going on.
So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with Blockchain.
It was.
It was.
Oh, there's.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think you're right.
So the run up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14, it looks like.
Okay.
So it officially shuttered February 2014 though.
And the big.
The 1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like.

**SPEAKER_02:**
When did the hack happen?

**SPEAKER_00:**
December.
Oh, I think right here.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, right there.
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So, yeah, interesting times for sure, because.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I think Monk Gox and.
Oh, what was.
I'm blanking right now.
What.
What was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road?
Silk Road, Yeah.
Like, I think it's.
Those were kind of intertwined in those early days.
Right.
So I remember like even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about.
And I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there.
Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You know, that's.
Wow.
I think I never did that.
I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road.
Just heard about it at like, I had to make Mt.
Gox account and some others.
There was a period where like, Dwala was doing crypto stuff and then I think they stopped and I believe they're still around as like a payment API company.
But yeah, because I definitely use them and some others.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mount GOG hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other.
And that was like the sort of like, you know, as you mentioned, like the first kind of iteration of like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now and then it just keeps coming back.
Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it sure does.
Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There's a little bit of bias in the new.
The news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world.
Like if.
If there's.
If there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place.
And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that, like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person.
So it's always like much more tied into.
You know, the price of.
Of bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens.
But you don't see like, the crashing because, like, somebody commits Fraud somewhere.
I mean, I guess if the fraud's big enough.
But.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I agreed.
Just segue.
Yeah, segueing quickly.
Can you guys go into how you met?
Because you guys met first.
And then we can do the whole.
How we all.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, Jim, do.
Do I.
Do I want to start or do you want to start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'll start.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And I'll pass it over.
I, actually, so I had.
Back in the 90s, I was in academia and in the odds.
I was in the startup world and I'd done a couple startups and I was ending one of my startups and I had two sons who were in the.
Our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school.
And I.
At this time, there was just a coincidence.
Both my wife and I had ended jobs and we said, hey, let's do something crazy right now and let's.
Let's take this to its extension.
Let's go to China and actually put them in a school there.
So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victors in Beijing.
And he says, I'm going to get you in touch with these guys.
So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can explain.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, yeah, and so the vc, you know, who we're still friends with her g.
Like, he kind of came up to me and he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant cto and he says he wants to come to China.
I'm not sure how serious he is.
So, you know, don't put all your eggs in this basket.
But then we started talking that summer and you weren't like, traveling the country, so you were like in a different place every time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Around the country and.
And I remember, like, you know, like we were kind of talking over the summer and I was like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming and.
And at one point you said, okay, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing.
And I went to the school that my kids went to, which.
And said, like, you know, can you make space for, you know, two foreign kids, this international program?
They said, yes, if you can, but the kids have to be here the first day of school.
And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.
So I called Jim up and said, look, I can do it.
You know, I can guarantee a place for them but you have to be here on this day.
And to my shock, he actually said yes.
And he, like, parked up his house.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And like, everything in the house in, like, I think we had 12 days to be in school and we probably were.
Had to have the house packed within, like.
Like, I don't know, less than a week.
So that was a crazy week.
But.
But Victor was a great help in, like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about.
Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything and he knew.
He knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.
So, yeah, it was a great experience.

**SPEAKER_02:**
It was an exciting time to be in China.
Was right around the first Olympics, you know, like, it was right around that, the Beijing Olympics.
And so it was a really exciting time.
But yeah, you wound up saying for about 18 months.
Right.
In total and a little less.

**SPEAKER_01:**
But yeah, it was.
It was over a year.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.
And then we just kept in touch from there.
Like, we loved working together.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it was great year.
Did you arrive?
What was this?
Rough times, your period?
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Who are you asking?
Because it was different.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, 2011, Summer, we're driving all over the country.
2011, September, August, I can't remember.
We were.
We were in Beijing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Very cool.
And so then you're back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, we were back at.
When did we come back?
I guess we were back in the country in 2013.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Gotcha.

**SPEAKER_01:**
But like, January.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Let me actually, I'll segue.
I'm trying to keep it slightly chronological to keep, you know, everything in my mind here consistent.
So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015.
I got to start working on Ethereum, kind of purely by accident.
Maybe not purely by accident, but basically.

**SPEAKER_02:**
The.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I had passed my qualifying exam.
I'm going to say spring 2014 or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014.
So for those who have not.
Not aware of how PhD program works, qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.
So sometimes it's a coursework requirement.
Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like an academic work from one language to.
To another to show proficiency.
I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point.
And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study tense prep at Berkeley.
It's a three hour oral exam with a couple people from your department and one from an external department.
And then they give you a pass or not.
I got a pass, thankfully.
It was a.
I don't know that it was.

**SPEAKER_02:**
It was.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good.
Right?
Like, and, you know, so while I passed it, I gives like, you know, didn't feel great at least the rest of that day.

**SPEAKER_02:**
When did you find out the result?
Like, immediately.
Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You put you in the hall and they tell you, yeah, okay, that's good.
So you're just like very nervous.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know what it was like for you, but for me it was just like three guys I knew and I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and like, you know, like calculate numbers or something.
They just kind of come out and they're like, yeah, yeah, exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, it was like that.
Right?
Yeah, it's, it's a oral.
It's subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got like several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects, so they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.
So anyway, so kind of a.
The qualifying exam led to, you know, I needed like a short break from math.
I was in mathematical physics and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking, I can't quite remember, so something having to do with like Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks.
I can't, can't remember at this time, but, you know, it seemed like an okay thing.
I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer.
I'm from New York and, you know, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture and I didn't fully do it.
I still, you know, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there.
But anyway, by the way, yes, yes, Jim's there.
I'm in the state of New York at the moment.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But yeah, but I, you know, I need a little break basically.
And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project.
So somehow my, you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow.
My dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project basically because he was always.
He was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time.
He had a CS background, plus the financial background.
And ran a hedge fund for a number of years.
And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services.
And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families.
He's from Toronto.
A lot of, A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another.
And he went, I believe, to.
It might have been a bitcoin meetup at that time or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup.
But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe.
And Vitalik was speaking there.
And you know, like everyone around that time where you see Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited, right?
And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away.
He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project.
And you know, it didn't turn out that way.
We can go into it a little bit later.
But he started working on it again, let's say February, March 2014.
And so he just sent me the white paper, like right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam, I got a chance to read it and it was pretty cool and interesting and new and that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of the technology and it caused me to go back and read the bitcoin white paper, et cetera.
And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer basically.
So that's how I got into it.
And subsequently Jim alluded to this earlier.
I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, great, great friend of ours, kind of, I don't know, not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous, super cool guy and had been a long time reader of Steve's blog.
He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time, I don't know, distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience.
But Steve is actually good at that, but with nuanced coverage of technical topics.
So anyway, caught up with Steve and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.
And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area.
So that takes us to maybe January, sorry, June, July 2014, and maybe I came back in August or something like that.
And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in, in Hayward and we got to meet up.
What do you think?
August 2014, September, something like that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, it was around then because also ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back.

**SPEAKER_02:**
That's all Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip ob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Soul searching.
You do a literal search around the country.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, see, I was in Montana and then I was back in the Bay Area and then we talked.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, okay, that's cool.
How was Montana, by the way?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Wow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Maybe we shouldn't go.
Yeah, Montana.
Oddly crypto friendly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
Big sky country, right?
Big sky country.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, so let me see here.
I want to.
I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Just before we go past 2014.
So I moved back from China in 2014.
And so, you know, me and Jim were talking about like, oh, now that we were, I was back, what kind of project could we do together?
So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were like thinking about, okay, you know, like, maybe we could work on a startup together.
And at some point you forwarded me the paper as well.
So like, I think once.
So that's, that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I want to give.
Yeah, I don't want to speak the whole time, but.
But I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So in 2014, so basically I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014.
As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European, but you know, you had Canada, you got a, had a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel.
In the early days, we worked out of an office, my dad and I and guy named Stephen Nureyev, who is now kind of famous actually, if you Google the name, you know, it's.
It's definitely an interesting and colorful story that I'll go into a little bit, and a guy named Jonathan whose last name I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a good guy.
And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or how that all happened.
So we're working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people.
So, you know, that's When I met Steve Hsu, who introduced me to Jim, basically just kind of calling up whoever might be interested.
But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was they acknowledged that there would be a need for kind of ongoing pure research and then in addition to more like focused R and D to build the network out.
And so Vitalik at some point penned an article about 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or something of that nature in which, and I think it was, if we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated.
I'm sure some of them have been solved and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged.
But basically he foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity.
For instance, many things with that transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just energy efficient blockchains which people were talking about at that time.
But my position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful as the, the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people.
Despite being like, both of them being really smart groups of people, blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way and all that sort of thing.
Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong because you're wrong enough in public, there are kind of consequences for it.
And the kind of, I would say the tech attitude in general is like getting something out there, you know, get it to work basically, but get it out.
And then iterate and blockchain people had that, you know, in a extreme.
And I would say also Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture.
The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing but academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything.
And the Ethereum people were more like have like the software, computer science, engineering attitude of like, well, let's get it out there, let's, let's tinker with it, let's kind of see what happens.
And there's good arguments for both, especially when you're talking about like a system that custodies, well, not custody, but you know, that records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred.
But all that is to say it was useful for the Ethereum foundation to have sort of someone who was actively in academia to kind of work with and coordinate everything.
So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group and that was composed of sort of myself, Vitalik and our friend Aaron Wright.
Was kind of.
He's since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School.
And he came to that Times Square office, which was, you know, not the greatest of offices, I would say, and just sort of really leaned in on Ethereum and kind of helped structure everything so that it would be kind of the most robust.
Not just technology, but they actually did kind of a quite good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did, you know, certainly did not do as good a job, I'll say.
So it was funny Times.
And in 2014, I also got to go to Zug.
For those who don't know, the Ethereum foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland.
And it was kind of.
It's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations because I guess the Ethereum foundation sort of blazed a path.
And.
Okay, funny thing about Switzerland is that the kind of local authorities also seem like business people.
Like, they want to land the future tax revenue and employment.
And so you can kind of, once Switzerland is split into some number of cantons, which are like states, a little smaller than US States, of course.
And so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer.
And offer really means like, you know, tax treatment, any kind of grants, or just like, you know, and helping get fast answers around legal questions.
You know, one of the tough things about the United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed.
And the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear, you know, about what, what they wanted for the special tax treatment and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So we went out and visited Zoog, I don't know, mid late summer 2014.
And I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time.
I believe there are kind of eight in total.
And, you know, so I think those.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Numbers changed over time, though.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, those numbers changed, yes.
So.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, but.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But, yeah, I think so.
I don't exactly know how all of it happened, but, you know, Vitalik, it was always a global project, right?
So Vitalik would kind of go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would want to work with the project.
And so a bunch of folks got attached to it.
And, you know, I think obviously it worked, right?
But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it, because 8 is just like too many.
Like, if you Went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight co founders.
And they're not all, you know, currently running billion dollar companies.
You'd be just laughed out of the room.
And yet it, it worked, right?
It actually functioned.
And the, you know, so kind of the way it broke apart was that there were like the technical element, technical guys.
So I think, I don't quite know how this happened but pretty early on, like Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilkie started building out versions of Ethereum, the C and Go clients specifically.
We'll go into the client soon because there's good stories there.
Vitalik was building the Python client.
They were all working together on technical documentation.
And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that bitcoin was controlled and centralized because there's only really one definitive client Bitcoin D.
Right.
And so there was this kind of huge replication of technical effort.
Like each of them eventually got their own teams.
There were JavaScript clients, many of them kind of came out later and I'd say the project, so the project had sort of tech folks and business folks.
Like, like any tech project didn't really have a nominal CEO at any time.
It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson.
So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like on the business side, Charles is the CEO Amir Chitreat who is really kind of did business development.
He's a funny guy.
I still see him every once in a while.
Joe, my dad and Anthony DiIorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience.
And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff Gavin and then Mihaly had sort of done corporate setup.
I believe Mihaly worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin magazine.
So Vitalik, very interesting character where most of the time your technical geniuses are not good communicators.
And he was sort of a journalist running Bitcoin magazine, writing a lot of the articles.
If he started it or kind of joined it and you know, he would, he would.
I think he kind of crowdfunded the articles a little bit.
Like for, you know, if I can get a pledge of one bitcoin, I'll write an article about X, you know.
And at the time of Bitcoin was inexpensive but you know those, those values went up and I, I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism, you know, the articles he wrote in the future and it led him to kind of have a sort of impartial thought leader position in addition to his really strong technical Ability and the ideas he was generating, etc.
And I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them.
Like I think Master Coin was maybe the first colored coin project.
He did some work on that.
So anyway, so those were the eight at the time and there was a meeting for everyone to kind of get on the same page, you know, remote project.
There was a slack.
People were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting.
People are stressed, they're trying to deliver on this like awesome concept that Vitalik put out there.
And then everyone kind of tried to grab ownership of like was there a reason to have all these different clients?
You know, in the end, empirically it worked, right?
But a little bit of it was a I want, you know, Ethereum to be mine sort of thing.
And I saw this in the room when we were visiting there.
So basically it kind of, it was quite dramatic, the trip.
So basically on this, this trip everyone went outside at some point and people were kind of a little bit sick.
The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent.
There's always this tension probably especially early in a company where the tech people are like, what do I need you business guy for?
We're going to make this thing and it's going to get out there and the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etc.
And it's subjective stuff that the tech people don't like or sometimes understand.
And more or less this happened.
You know, people were uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making and just the accusations.
I don't really even, you know, I, I know Charles some, but I don't even really know what was going on at that time.
But there was this general sense of frustration with him.
He also seems to be in some ways executing well on like a effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of bringing people out.
And then we kind of seen later, you know, I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive I would say, but that, you know, the jury was not out at that time in my eyes.
Right.
And Amir also was in target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like.
And so they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug, you know, and I was like, they were like out on the terrace.
It's like they had like a nice sort of loft that they rented that was like the Ethereum dev house in Zug.
And so I'm like watching this happen and you know, it was kind of quite crazy.
And then actually they instated two more co founders, so to speak, right then who kind of jumped on board the project and helped out.
It was, it was like a fun and kind of crazy trip.
Otherwise, you know, we went out in Zurich, some people got in trouble with the cops.
I won't add more detail to that, but Zurich's a funny place where in the US we're not used to people drinking on the street.
And in Zurich everyone drinks on the street and few people are in the bars, you know, so it was a strange experience.
We went on some hikes.
You know, it's, it's a very nice part of the world, Switzerland, but plenty of drama.
You know, in the early days I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about like he had this book about like swarm behavior and you know, he learned I had a mathematical background.
We're talking about like the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.
But yeah, the, the, the, it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized.
They were also grappling with the decision on initially they wanted to have a non profit protocol and a for profit, they called it a crypto Google at the time to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol.
And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently.
But that was also decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And people didn't like it.
You know, some folks started talking about Brain Drain.
It was a mix.
Some people liked it, some, some didn't.
Sort of the threat being like if you don't do this for profit, like I'm going to leave this, this project kind of thing.
And I think about everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses.
So you know, it is what it is.
But anyways, let me, let me pause and see if you guys.
Did I tell this whole story, you know, to you guys at any point?

**SPEAKER_02:**
I, I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing, but yes, I, I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period, short period of time, you know, that like I, I, I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes.

**sPEAKER_00:**
I think it was all like, I think it was going on continually.
But it came to a head all in this one meeting, a sort of a funny memory.
We so Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time and we met with a guy named Nicholas.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Who.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Maybe was the CEO or one of the founders.
I just googled it it says founder and there's a different CEO now.
But he made this funny.
He's a nice guy and I think something happened there.
I'm not quite sure.
He made this funny comment.
We were in an elevator.
This shows the difference between the American and Swiss attitude.
We're in an elevator and it was one of the ones where it's kind of hand operated and you do it yourself and it's just like the door could just easily close on you.
And I was like, wow, we'd never have this in the US because we're so litigious.
And they said, well, yeah, Swiss attitude, natural selection.
Anyways.

**sPEAKER_01:**
I know sometimes I think things get grandfathered in.
Like some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too.

**sPEAKER_00:**
They are certainly.
Yeah.
It could just be that it's older there.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Right?

**sPEAKER_00:**
That makes sense.
But yes, I think the big.
Other than.
So Zoog, you know, basically what we saw or let me see, there was growing momentum around the project.
Lots of people all over the world kind of working on it.
Stuff was probably not tightly papered.
You know, there's no like employment agreements.
Probably at that time it was like.
But there was really intense excitement and I think the belief that everyone was going to be mega successful out of it, like one way or another, you know, it's been kind of interesting to watch.
Jim, do you want to talk about getting into it?
And I alluded to all the different clients of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one.
Do you want to tell your report of that part now?

**sPEAKER_01:**
Well, this part of the story, when you were doing all that stuff, I was too busy driving around the country.
But I came back.

**sPEAKER_00:**
It comes in a little later.
Two, three months later.
Right.
Or the rest.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, right.
At the end of the summer.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Right.

**sPEAKER_01:**
When you were coming back?
I think so.
And that's when, when I got really interested in it.
I remember like the whole culture.
So I got, I got fascinated with the technology.
When I read the white paper, that's when I realized this was something.
Something big.
And I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit.
But it was a.
It was a foreign culture to me.
Like we, we decided to.
So Natasha, my wife and I, we decided just to see what, what this world was like.
We'd buy, try, try buying a little bitcoin.
And I remember we sort of.
We looked a little bit at the various ways to do it.
And the way we decided on was to meet Some, someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley.
And we got there and he was told, totally the stereotype.
The dude was walking around with like the, the five toed shoes.
And we kind of like it, it all felt very salacious.
We walked in with this packet of money in our hands and we had to like meet this guy and he spent most of the time like.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Do you remember, did you use like local bitcoins?
That was popular.
I don't know if it's still in existence.
Local bitcoins.
Okay, gotcha.
Sorry.
Go ahead, Jim.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, he, he spent most of the time there railing against the government and how, how much he hated the, the US government and all the things they, the, you know, all the, all the terrible things they were doing.
And, and we kind of like transferred the envelope over to him and then we pulled up the, a computer or our phones or something and we were like watching for six blocks to come by.
And finally it went through and we, we got our, we were, we were finally bitcoin owners.

**sPEAKER_00:**
So what, did you hang out with him for an hour or.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Because I think we did wait for the six.
Well, we might have been maybe after three.
He said to us, like, you're welcome to stay here if you want, but I, I find that after three it probably won't revert or something.
So maybe we, Oh, I remember what it was.
We, we went out and sat in the car for another 30 minutes just in case we had to run back in again.

**sPEAKER_02:**
So.

**sPEAKER_00:**
That's really funny.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Oh, man.
Yeah.

**sPEAKER_01:**
So I, I, that, that was our introduction into bitcoin.
And then around this time, you and I started hanging out a lot.
We were meeting regularly and I was working, I, I had started working on the Haskell client and I brought you in on that.
And we were, we'd have like these coding sessions at your place.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, man.
Okay, so we've gone to.
So that's fall 2014, right when we started coding or even like.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**sPEAKER_01:**
And I, you know, I was sort of laughing when you were talking about the over promising.
Like, I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember like trying to understand what it was at the beginning.
And some of, some of the material out there was great, but some of it was just very vague and over broad.
Like I would like go to these YouTube videos and people would be like, ethereum is a new way of life.
It's going to take over as a second Internet.
And we were going to rebuild the Internet from beginning to end.
And I was like, what are they talking about?
And so the only way I was going to really understand this stuff, I thought, was to literally just start like writing code.
And so, you know, you can't hide what's happening once you have like.
So I talked about the white paper, but.
But Gavin Wood had put out a yellow paper at the same time which talked about the technical details of the innards.
And so I started looking through that and implementing that in my favorite language, Haskell, and bit by bit, putting the whole EVM in Haskell code.
So that's what most of the end of the.
Of the year was like.
Until I think in December.
I was.
I'm from.
I'm from the east coast myself.
And we flew.
Sorry, we flew out to New York and, and I met.
You introduced me.
I.
You were there at the time too.
You.
You introduced me to Joe Lubin.
And actually, I think before that too, you had had set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and Joe directly too.
So.
And just more and more with the, the fact that we had had a working client that we were sort of following very closely.
All the changes in, in the testnet era before, before things were solidified, we just got pulled more and more into the.
To that world.
And I think, like one of the big things.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Sorry, I was like, we've been, you know, sort of assuming an expert audience.
Can you define the term client for everybody?

**sPEAKER_01:**
Oh, so it's the software that blockchain runs on.
The thing about usual software is that, you know, like, if I just like, run a video game or something, I just get a computer and I put the software on it.
And that's.
That's my running project in a blockchain.
It's blockchain.
It's a distributed thing.
So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on any.
On multiple computers simultaneously.
So you're building sort of a world computer of chained nodes, they call them.
And so we were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing test work.
Netanya at the time.

**s:57**
**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, gotcha.
Perfect.
Putting us in the client's arms race, if you will.
That was the one I was, I was trying to make.
I want to talk real quickly about some other things from that summer.
You guys participated in the crowd sale, did you not?
That's why you bought the bitcoin the first time, or did you buy it sort of first?
Yeah, got a token amount.
Yeah, gotcha.
So the.

**sPEAKER_02:**
From our.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Our side, we ended up mostly my dad, but Obviously with help from the Ethereum people.
So they coded up a site to do the crowd sale.
So Ethereum was one of the first, maybe the first to pioneer basically, you know, a kind of pre funding event, if you will, where they sold the token Ether in exchange for Bitcoin to the users.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Basically an ico, right?
Like what we're.

**sPEAKER_00:**
It was, it was essentially an ico.
There was no name for it then, but the.
I remember it was.
The price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was like one Bitcoin to 2000 Ethereum, which meant you made pretty good returns if you participated in the crowd sale and sold at the right time or still holding.
So but the way it worked, it was complicated.
So ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy for Bitcoin.
It was basically, I think the Ethereum foundation had to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to and so that they could mint the, the Ether in the genesis block for you and you also.
But the, the foundation, like, you know, rightfully in decentralization terms, did not want to just hold everybody's keys, right?
So you had to sort of generate your own keys and the website did this and download them and there's these huge warnings like you must download this file.
If you lose this file, you will lose access to your funds.
And so that some of the Ethereum folks coded it up and there was some.
They had, I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for traceability's sake.
I'm not quite sure if they did that.
Maybe there was just one Exodus address or all that sort of thing.
But actually no, there must have been just one.
So we were a little bit the help desk.
So sometimes people would try to find.
It wouldn't work, try to try to purchase Ether.
And there were interesting goings on.
There was like a fake Twitter account that emerged with the E and the U in Ethereum Transpose.
So it looked just like Ethereum and they had assembled, you know, 25,000 followers or something, no doubt bots that whatever hacker controlled or maybe you pay for those.
And they were offering special deals on Ether, so it went live.
So this is something that's been going on for 10 years now.
I've heard new crypto projects, when they start to get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now.
So they've gotten more sophisticated.
But yeah.
I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping escalate the ticket that you know, because the like big theft could occur.
And I believe did not.
Jonathan configured one of the block explorers, Maybe it was blockchain.info I can't remember.
So that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play.
So we were in this room and we were like, we're in the room all day because it's like we're in like help desk mode and we just hear the things come in.
And there was a schedule over like 14 days you could fund at no monetary consequence.
And then the price started to go up over the course of I believe a 42 day sale.
So all in all, I think, you know, 7,000 unique purchasers, something like that.
But it was like, it was quite an affair.
Right.
It's definitely more streamlined now.
And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion that, you know, they're selling software in essence to people from, you know, a reputable law firm.
And you know, some of that, all that made it to the terms and conditions, this big rush to get it all done.
And then.
So I think they raised.
Didn't even remember it was like 22 million bucks at the, the time.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, I thought it was.
Well, it was in bitcoin, so I think it was like 20 mil.
Well, I remember vaguely that it was.

**sPEAKER_00:**
At the time of the sale it was 22 million.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, I think it was the biggest crowdfunding event ever or something.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I believe that's right.
It's either one or two ever at that time and it's since been surpassed by tons.
Many of which were done.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, exactly.
But yeah, but like I think at the time it was around or over 20 million.
So.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, that's, that's right.
And interestingly, in the course of the sale and maybe a little bit having to do with the sale, the price of bitcoin starts to go down.
So I believe it's 600 or so at the start of the sale.
And it's just, it's kind of.
We notice it dropping kind of continually, I guess.
And maybe at the end of it it's like high fours, low fives and you know, it's foreshadowing.
It'll kind of go on to drop from there, but yeah.
Okay, so did you guys remember the experience of the, the, the funding site and all that sort of thing?
I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.

**sPEAKER_01:**
I remember the site.
I remember a clock on it, but I don't remember too much else about it.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Okay, so the crowd sale is like not a huge part of your memory.
It's a huge part of mine, I guess because we were like dealing with all of the issues.
But Vic, were you, you were just getting kind of interested at this time, right?
Like.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, yeah, exactly.
Like, well, Jim, like Jim basically when he, he was going to buy this bitcoin, he was like, oh, I'm gonna buy this bitcoin.
And to participate in the crowd sale.
Do you want to participate?
And I was like, you know, I'm gonna feel like a real idiot if I don't do anything.
So I just, it was just some.
Yeah, we were just gonna say like some.
Yeah, it was, we have poured our resources together because it was so hard.

**sPEAKER_00:**
It wasn't easy.
Right.
You're like generating this.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Seed phrases, you know, this, that and the other.

**sPEAKER_02:**
It just was mind bogglingly complicated, you know, so.
And, but like I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual bitcoin.
Like, you know, Jim was in the Bay Area, right.
The part of it and all duck things.
You know, I was in Vancouver and it wasn't.
Vancouver was an early bitcoin adopter, but it was still really, really hard to find anyone who would be willing to sell you bitcoin.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Yeah, that's very interesting.
Yes.
In any case, the.
Okay, so the sale happens and now the project is funded and it's really funded.
I suppose there are plenty of mega VC investments at that time, but the bubble years in 2020, 2021 were not heard of at this time.
Series A investments were still between 3 and 10 million bucks.
Salaries probably a little lower than they are now.
Back then this was a lot of money.
And so the Ethereum folks then kind of, it was very technically driven.
They kicked in all of their technical dreams, so to speak.
So Jim's point about the really big claims, they really were in a sense trying to create a whole new Internet.
A couple examples.
So not just the proliferation of clients.
Right.
They're going to make a browser, the Mist browser.
They're going to make a peer to peer messaging system called Whisper.
They're going to make a decentralized file storage system.
They chose to make a virtual machine like Java.
And you know, go, sorry, C lost but Solidity won.
And Solidity was kind of put together by Gavin.
It's sort of a C Java script looking language.
Yeah, there was another One LL was like a lisp, like language to some extent.
It let the developers just be free to do things that developers always want to do, like build peer to peer messaging systems, write compilers, you know, it was like.
Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, no, that was, that was funny.
Okay, let's go to.
Because we can get close to wrapping up here and you know, if, if there's interest, we could do another one of these because there's lots after the launch.
Let's go to kind of right before the launch.
Okay.
So as we're talking about the launch run up, a bunch of interesting things happened.
One, we had started to some extent working as part of consensus.
So we kind of joined the company and they functioned sort of as an incubator basically for us and plenty of other firms concepts, some of which stayed in house, some of which also spun out.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Brooklyn was awesome too.
I, I'd never been to Williamsburg, Bushwick, and, and it was sort of moving in various locations there.
So I was, I used to love coming and hanging out at the offices.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it was consensus.
Got the, the famous office on Bogart.
But first was at an office by the water in Williamsburg.

**sPEAKER_02:**
It was in Greenport.
I remember getting completely lost at one point and finding it and like, yeah, Williamsburg is great.

**sPEAKER_01:**
I remember, I remember like sitting there one day and all of a sudden everybody came screaming in and, and they were filming an episode of Girls outside and so I ran outside and watched them film an episode of Girls or part of an episode of Girls.
Not the whole episode, no.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Wow.
Yeah, that was so.
Okay, so that's early.
What was it?
March?
April?

**sPEAKER_02:**
That was around.
Yeah, I think it was April May kind of thing.
Well, we moved into the Bogart office just before the launch of Ethereum.
In fact, one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Right, right.
Okay.
Yeah, I do remember that.
So, you know, so we're frantically building the software.
We're starting to work with people from within consensus.
So we had some folks, you know, join the project, some of whom have gone on to, you know, big blockchain success.
Should we tell the, the Tim story?

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, yeah, I mean, Tim, the founder of Truffle, helped us kind of build our first blockchain explorer.
You know, I mean, he was a brilliant developer back then and still remains bread to be developer.
Aaron, I think, helped us kind of he who went on to build Metamask.
You know, we had lots of conversations with him about how to Create our REST API and how it would work.

**sPEAKER_00:**
I met up a couple times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also.
It was funny, like these folks would just come by and now they're like sort of different levels of a big deal.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Exactly.

**sPEAKER_00:**
I feel like you should tell the hard hitting version of the tip story just, you know, a little bit because it was fun money in retrospect.
Right.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, I, I think the thing is that we were really focused on at the time.
I think the first idea that we had with block apps was that we would create like a REST API and we, you know, I, I come from sort of a lean startup background.
Like we really want to push deadlines and at the time people were more in an exploration or they were trying to do different things.
And I was kind of ratcheting up the pressure to kind of present this at some, I don't know if it was a conference or some meetup in a particular night.
And you know, as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that, people were like, you know, I think I want to kind of pursue my other interest instead of like working in this high pressure environment.
And you know, like, and a lot of early consensus was like that.
Like it was like different working styles and different methodologies.
But in the end it was kind of amazing.
Like you know, the people who did stuff.

**s:41**
**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I would say lots of really smart people and a lot of flow between projects.
It was amorphous at the beginning.
There was a lot of excitement.
But it was also hard to like get someone who is your assigned to your team to like do the thing you expected.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, there weren't team assignments.
Right.
Like there weren't the teams.
I mean we had, we had, they.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Were suggested, you know, exactly like and.

**sPEAKER_02:**
But you know, people were just flowing in and out, which is great for creativity, but was hard when you were trying to make a deadline deadline because you know when you're trying to make a deadline there's always sort of not great things to have to do.
Right.
Like you got work, really long hours and that kind of stuff.

**s:12**
**s:13**
**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
And let me see what I felt.
So we kind of, we looked and saw, you know, in our early approach some success at API companies like chain.com was at the time touting a big list of customers that use their API.
They then pivoted to a couple other things, more enterprise outlook and then they kind of a little bit pivoted back and then were eventually bought by, sort of bought by Stellar, I believe.
So there's some precedent for like, okay, let's have an API, let's make this really easy for people to use.
And this being the Ethereum network itself, and I think we found pretty strong resistance to this idea.
Oh yeah, do you want to talk more about.

**sPEAKER_02:**
So I think while you guys were working on the client, what I was trying to do was build you know, like smart contract based applications.
Right.
And it was really like you described some of the toolol, right.
Which was missed and like for front ends and you know, the languages were constantly changing.
Like a lot of this seemed to be an afterthought.
Like, okay, we're going to solve that later on the puzzle.
But it was impossible to build an application, share it around, just get something running quickly, you know, and so we like, you know, my background was like web and mobile startups and like the first thing you look for is a REST API.
And I thought like, okay, if, if we're ever going to get this ecosystem to really work, we need to have something like that so people can build these applications on, you know, we couldn't cobble together all these tools.
But yeah, we got a lot of resistance to it because you know, it.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Was like we were speaking Martian to people.
Like, these are people.
But they had no like interest in like anything that sounded a little bit corporate.

**sPEAKER_02:**
So it wasn't even corporate.
It was more like, like, you know.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, there was a general suspicion of servers.
I remember the phrase like, yeah, I don't know if I want to work anything on anything that involves any servers.
I remember at the time, you know, like a peer to peer network.
It's like every peer is both a client and a server.
Like, you know, it's sort of, kind of intrinsic, you know.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, there was a lot of belief in the time that effectively everyone would run a node and like, you know, like at some point you'd run a node in your browser or run a node on your phone and I'm like, look, I ran a mobile application company.
Like I know how big these clients are.
Like, I don't want my first things.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Going to get very hot.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, exactly.
Like burning my ass, you know, sitting in my pocket trying to mine Ether.
Right.
So yeah, it was just very strange, these kind of conversations.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
And kind of concurrently.
So more aligned with our perspective, consensus sort of grew an enterprise team which focused sort of on advising big corporates on blockchain and then implementing it for them.
And we kind of worked with them on go to market even before the launch of Ethereum, more after.
So we'll kind of hold on that discussion maybe for a subsequent episode.
But okay, what about.
Do you guys have any specific memories of the hackathons?
We did.

**sPEAKER_02:**
So the first hackathon we did was in Greenpoint and we basically, it was sort of internal to consensus people and I think it was mostly interns that of kind had participated.
We had a very crude version of our API working and it was really, you know, like, I think over, I think over a 48 hour period, no one could build anything basically.
Like, like it was like.
But I think the premise that people were coming up with to use our API to build stuff, we could see some potential in it.
So like people are doing, you know, interesting things like incentivizing location based scavenger hunts and other kind of things.
And we found that interesting enough that, you know, and I think this, that was in May, June of 2015 by that time.
And then we figured out that there was, you know, the launch would probably happen in August of that year.
And we were like, okay, let's take off all the input we got from that hackathon and do like a real hackathon, like get, you know, a bunch of participants, get a bunch of people involved and you know, try and get all the people from consensus, but people outside consensus involved.
And we were kind of like furiously trying to make our product more stable and work and take all the input we got from that first one into the second one when we didn't know exact.
I think the plan was to do it on the day of the launch of Ethereum and.
But we didn't know the exact date yet.
So we were just furiously.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Right before or right after, I can't remember.

**sPEAKER_02:**
I, I think it was right after.
Yeah, I think it was like two days after or something like that.
But you know, it was, it was in the same timing of the launch basically.
So I, you know, as far as I'm aware, that was like the first Ethereum hackathon.

**sPEAKER_01:**
I remember maybe it was the second or third one.
We met the Crane brothers.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I think that was the one right after the launch.

**sPEAKER_02:**
That was.
Yeah, that was later.

**sPEAKER_01:**
That wasn't.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Didn't they, they didn't want one at the launch.
They won.
So that hackathon where we met them was actually the first consensus conference hackathon.

**sPEAKER_00:**
I don't think that's true.
I think that one was later.
I think they.
Oh no, you're right.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
I think they came to the first.
Or at least John did.
Well, maybe.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah, they came to the second one, the first one right after the launch.
Right.
This is funny.
This is another foreshadowing for a future episode.
But yes, the IBM, you know, they've been circling this this whole time and they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the consensus hackathon.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Like, I remember us furiously and, and just the uncertainty of the launch.
I was like, I remember we had many, many conversations like, is this thing ever going to launch?
Like, we weren't sure if it would happen.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Do you remember?
Okay, let's talk quickly about the mining that we did.
And this was all for the company, you know.
But do you, do you recall what we.
We did at that time?

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, I totally remember.
So I remember.
Well, at some point up to the launch, we realized, okay, if we were going to help.
If we were going to help businesses or other groups build applications on Ethereum, we would need Ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions.
And so we're like, well, where are we going to get this Ether from?
And, you know, I think the first thing that happened was you guys were like, oh, we need to build a mining route.
Right.
I'll hand that over to you, Jim.
I think that was.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Karen and I drove up to Fries and picked up a bunch of components.

**sPEAKER_00:**
We did.
And, you know, we, we're kind of ready for it because we.
I believe we had.
You had helped me build just like a workstation.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Or two before.
Basically, like the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation.
So it's made a big productivity difference.
We went back and.
Yeah, I think so.
I moved closer to campus at that time.
We took a couple different shots at mining.
But what did you know, I think mine exploded, the power supply blew up.
The graphics card was actually okay.
Something happened to yours, I can't remember.

**sPEAKER_01:**
But we got it going eventually.
But the part that was funny I remember is that we spent like two or three days building these machines, getting it up, putting the software on, getting it running, hitting some problems.
And it started like Ether started to dribble in at that point in time.
So we're like, oh, this is awesome.
And then we called up Victor and he's like, yeah, in the last half hour I just like spun up a few machines at Amazon and I'm getting as much Ether as you guys are.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, it was more than a few machines.
So, like, I remember watching you guys build this and like, thinking like, oh, like, this is good.
Launch any day now, right?
Like, so, like, I, I said, like, can someone give me an image of the Go client?
So, and I took that image and I just, like, put on Amazon and a bunch of Spot instances.
And at some point I was like, running like.
And I just bought as many spot instances as were available.
Like, what?
Whatever met my price, I bought.
And this was before, you know, mining was even known, that this was something that happened.
So I could still get it pretty cheap.
And there weren't.
The blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast even if you were starting.

**sPEAKER_01:**
None of this is stuff you could do today.
In fact, none of this is.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Exactly.
And it stopped being effective.
Like, I mean, I remember at the point of the launch, I.
You guys were saying, yeah, we got our first ether.
And I was like, do you see this graph?
Like, you know, this is the total mining power of the Ethereum network.
That large wedge, which was like 25 is me on Spotify.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Oh, God, we should have, we should have cranked it up just like another couple weeks longer.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, I think by the time, you know, three days have passed, I, I passed like several thousand dollars.
Like, our AWS bill was like, yeah.

**sPEAKER_00:**
It seems super expensive.

**sPEAKER_02:**
It seems super expensive at the time.
And like, I was like, wow, like, this is good.
But yeah, we should, I should have ran it like, you know, a month basically.
And then.
But it was, it was pretty amazing because, like, yes, I, I, you know, I'm not a DevOps guy, but I was like, writing hundreds of machines the time and it was just amazing.

**sPEAKER_00:**
One thing I, I struggle to remember.
How did they communicate that the network was ready to launch?
Was it like Twitter email?
Like, how did we even know?
Like, we knew.
We knew.
I think it was like, okay, they're close.
This is why I brought it up before.
They're like, okay, they're slowing down.
They're getting ready, you know, But I.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty into.
Involved in consensus at those days and everybody was talking about it and there were like multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining.
And so there was no, there was no missing it at the time.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
Good.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Sorry.
Like, like I said, I think there was, but, like, I think they had announced the date, but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not.
It turned out they did, like, that did turn out to be the date, but, like, everyone was kind of gearing up, but we were also, like, getting ready.
Like, oh, you know, it might not happen that day.
It might be a couple of days later.
It could be a couple of months later.
We just weren't sure.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, man, those.
Those are some times for sure.
Yeah.
Okay, so I think this is a good wrapping point for this first episode.
Hopefully we'll see if we get any feedback from the Internet at large whether we should keep going down this path.
But, you know, quite the journey already.
Lots of interesting things I've even remembered, you know, in the course of our couple hours here.
Thanks, guys.
Does feels like we should keep going with the story, but we'll see, you know, let's leave it as a cliffhanger.
All of the excitement to come.
Any final words?

**sPEAKER_02:**
Well, I.
I think, you know, it's funny, even if you look at the beginning, you see the same patterns now where there's this huge amount of inflow and then what seemed at the time like tons of hype, but now is like a trickle of hype, and what seemed like tons of capital, but now would be considered a trickle of capital.
And then like a kind of overconfidence and then a tightening, but then, you know, real technical stuff gets done in the tightening.
It's funny how that pattern has played out.

**sPEAKER_00:**
So a couple times now.

**sPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, exactly.

**sPEAKER_01:**
It's a funny type of cyclical.
Tell you about the time we saw Vitalik threw his shirt at someone.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Oh, that's a good story.
Yeah, the Vitalik short story is a good one.

**sPEAKER_01:**
Alrighty.

**sPEAKER_00:**
Let's.
Let's end it here.
Thanks, guys.
You know, we're doing this recording on a Sunday.
Hope it entertains and informs the wider world.
And we'll see you next time.
