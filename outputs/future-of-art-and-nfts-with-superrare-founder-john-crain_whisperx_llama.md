**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:00] Okay, we are live, and we have a very special episode today.
[00:02] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane.
[00:05] Welcome, John Crane.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:06] Hey, Victor.
[00:07] Hey, everyone.
[00:08] Hey.
[00:09] Good to see you guys.
[00:10] Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[00:11] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:14] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:18] Yeah, sure.
[00:19] Um, so yeah, I, let's see, my crypto journey started in around 2015, uh, going to the consensus hackathon where I met, um, at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:26] Um, yeah, I was, you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:30] I worked in advertising.
[00:31] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad and.
[00:34] Yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were a little bit past, you know, finance and trading.
[00:43] And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art.
[00:46] So it doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:48] Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[00:51] Obviously, we met there, but what was that?
[00:53] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:54] No, so I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
[00:56] Yeah, I had actually met, I think, John Lillick, which I forgot, but I met him at the like the New York Bitcoin Center, I don't know if you guys remember that, yeah, we do, yeah, so I was hanging around and actually I was like I was super into Counterparty, so I was very much like Ethereum's too complicated, you know, Vitalik's full of it, it's not gonna work, um, and then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong, like this is actually super cool, like, you know, I have no problem changing, I was like, I was totally wrong, this is amazing, and I was just like googling Ethereum blockchain hacker, I was like trying to find, uh, like get deeper involved, you know, I was trying to like quit my day job and go full-time crypto, and so then I, I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh, there's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied, uh, with Charles, and then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:30] Yeah, and to be clear, to let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project.
[01:34] And we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:38] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:39] Exactly.
[01:40] Yeah, I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on Block Apps.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:45] Yeah, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were- Yeah, yeah.
[01:48] Exactly.
[01:49] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:50] I remember there was like a couple week consulting transition period while, uh, you know, yeah, I think that's true.
[01:54] Yeah, maybe it was like, we started like hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit, and then, um, full-time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:59] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:00] So what inspired SuperRare?
[02:02] Like, you know, I know you when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[02:09] But what, what triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:16] Yeah, I, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[02:18] You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the Consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran are hanging out there, and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[02:27] Cause I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC-20 tokens, and like, I found it was super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code, but the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[02:42] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy, it was incredible to see that happen.
[02:49] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and like, I saw the CryptoKitties launch, um, and I was like, well, this is pretty crazy, if you think about the consumer web, it's all, uh, you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata, so like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs, and that, you know, like, I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[03:12] So that got me into NFTs.
[03:14] And then, on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like going to the art fairs, I had friends who were looking for gallery representation, and kind of part of the business of art, and it's just seemed obvious, I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets, and this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[03:33] So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, like my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:40] And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion?
[03:43] Because you guys, like, I know for a long time you were building, and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going, and, you know, like, no one is really paying attention, and all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:53] It was absolutely crazy.
[03:54] It was hard to be like, it was just like completely surreal the whole time.
[03:57] Like it felt like a dream.
[03:58] Like, we, you know, we started in 2018, we, you know, we were, we tried to raise money, it never really worked, like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive, and like, making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[04:10] So that's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:12] Yeah, it was like, it was much easier to raise then, than when I was like, I have this really cool idea, um, so it was, yeah, it was like, you know, it was, it was a grind, it was super volatile, many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life, um, but, uh, yeah, then it just, it just really started, like, I remember the numbers were like doubling every month for a while, and like, I remember it was October, 2020, was our first million-dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild, you know, cuz, but, 12 months ago, we were like, all right, so the volume was like $5,000, we made a couple hundred bucks, okay, yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[04:46] And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?
[04:49] I think, like, we're, we're trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:52] Yeah, we, yeah, we were the first to come, like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but like, we were the first to combine, like, the minting and the marketplace experience, so it was like, um, there weren't like great minting tools then, so we like, we started with the minting tool, and then we're like, all right, I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll, like, we'll build the marketplace too, and you know, it's partially just out of necessity, cause like the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[05:17] Yeah, it's funny because I remember, if you recall, what later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties, they were based in Vancouver, and I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time, and, I mean, you've done so much, one of the amazing things, it's the launch of the Rare token, and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality, like, you know, what led to that, and how did that go, like, you know, what did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:44] Yeah, I mean, you know, early on, I was like, part of, like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where, you know, if users of the networks also participate in the upside of the network, you know, like, there, there's the, you know, like the, the fat protocol article, um, that was super popular, like, 2016, so just like thinking about, like, okay, what does monetization look like, and can you build platforms that are, they're more like collaborative than extractive, where it's like, if you're Meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and sell ads, which is a great business, but partially for me, it was almost like a, a thought experiment of, like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads, and it could be, like, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kind of, it's like collective ownership via the token, um, so yeah, I was, you know, drinking, drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[06:30] Did you do it like classic ICO style, was there like a fixed price auction, how, how did it, how did the Rare get in there?

**UNKNOWN:**
[06:36] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:37] Yeah, we actually just did a huge airdrop, probably one of our mistakes, yeah, so like, we should have probably, you know, sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away, um, and yeah, I mean, yeah, there's plenty of challenges to, like, you know, DAOs are hard to manage and run, um, but you know, it's cool to see the current administration kind of like change tack and actually seem like they're interested in, like, building and pushing forward, um.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[07:01] So what do you think the biggest challenge was in, what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO, because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool-Aid, you know, running things completely decentralized, what do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it, and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[07:20] Yeah, I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory, like, you have, you know, like, you're kind of like trying to read the tea leaves, and then, rather than just making, like, the bet, you're like, okay, well, this is the simplest, best decision, you're like, okay, well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this, and like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment, um, and it's obviously, you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules, you know, it's like, the, obviously, like, the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement, uh, the dark, the dark ages, you know, Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:54] Isn't it?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[07:55] You know, yeah, man, do you think of advice?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[07:58] Do you think of it more like it should be like a representative democracy, like, should it be like passing bills in there, I think they're like, they're proposals, and there's like delegation, usually, is the model.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:07] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[08:08] It could also be like, just like you got a couple of leaders, but the stake could call a confidence vote or something, or, like, people, like, utarchy, too, I haven't tried it yet, but what's that, like, MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

**UNKNOWN:**
[08:19] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[08:20] I think, I think it kind of depends on, like, specifically what you're doing, you know, if it's something, like, you know, I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just like, you know, where it's like, if small changes can have potentially, like, catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing, if, you know, it's, you know, like SuperRare, where it's like, if there's a, there's a low-level protocol, and there's application, and, like, you know, other than, like, the escrow contracts for auctions, and things like, the stakes are, like, fairly low, I do kind of like the idea of, like, you sort of, like, if you can empower, like, a team, or a few individuals, to kind of just keep going, and then the token holders can, like, you know, raise awareness, but, like, part of it, too, I mean, actually, early on, we were, like, thought we would be more of an open platform, and then, as things progressed, there were more tools, like, you know, we were just trying, it was, like, we were building things, trying to add value, and, there's a ton of open tooling, so, like, early on, we kind of thought we might have, like, SuperRare, as, like, the ultra-curated view into the market, and then, maybe, you know, another kind of, like, open platform, that's, anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[09:24] I'm curious, like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance, like, being a curated kind of platform, and being open, you know, like, how do you think about those two, because I think one of the advantages of SuperRare, with the curation side, in art, you keep the quality very, very high, and, yeah, um, unlike, you know, more marketplace-type NFT platforms, which just, frankly, put a ton of crap, like, out there, so, yeah, yeah, how do you balance those two, and kind of keep decentralized, do you think, yeah, no, it is, I mean, it's kind of challenging, it's almost, uh, almost a paradox, um, I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:00] You know, we've kind of always taken the, like, minimal decentralization, so it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then you're like, one example is, like, we were, like, talking about, like, token models early on, it was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists, and I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine, you know, it's like, people voting, like, your art's terrible, like, you're like, oh, my word.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[10:23] I mean, in the, pump.fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time, yeah, you know, maybe we could have people streaming, yeah, it's like, live voting, like, is the art good or bad, watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[10:37] I did put stuff on a dating project once, where you basically had to be voted in, based on your looks, which just seems horrible, yeah, very, very evil, you know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:46] But there's writing out a ton of pages, remember those?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[10:48] Yes, yes, or Hot or Not, or all of those, oh, yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, just brutal, but, yeah, especially in places, you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:00] Yeah, it's challenging, and good art is subjective, I feel like, the on-chain auctions, escrow on-chain, that makes a lot of sense, on-chain voting for which artists are good, that's kind of, like, let people who are, like, making decisions, like, do their thing, and then, if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe, like, the token holders can, like, you know, raise awareness, but, yeah, and, like, part of it, too, I mean, actually, early on, we were, like, thought we would be more of an open platform, and then, as things progressed, there were more tools, like, you know, we were just trying, it was, like, we were building things, trying to add value, and, there's a ton of open tooling, so, like, early on, we kind of thought we might have, like, SuperRare, as, like, the ultra-curated view into the market, and then, maybe, you know, another kind of, like, open platform, that's, anyone could use.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[11:45] I'm curious, like, what was the, like, what, like, you know, it's a two-sided market, with market artists, and art buyers, like, what do you think, like, did you have to get the artist first, to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the artist?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:58] Yeah, we, you know, you kind of had to get both first, so, I mean, we started, like, just, you know, out of, like, it really started as just me, kind of, like, experimenting, and building, and, so we were, like, you know, started with the minting tools, I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people, and, I guess we, it first kind of piqued interest of the artists, like, I was, you know, like, we were, like, talking about, how it would work, and then, when we, when we first launched, the, we kind of had, um, so there's, uh, Jason Bailey, who was kind of, like, an early digital art advocate, you know, big writer, um, he ran a company, or runs a company, called Club NFT, that does, like, NFT art backups, yeah, and, he hit us up, and was like, hey guys, like, we've been talking to him, and he was like, I know you're getting close with your product, like, I want to buy this art on Monday, um, can I do it on SuperRare, and I, like, looked at Charlie, and I was like, dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet, on Monday, like, what can we, and so then we, basically, stayed up for 36 hours, uh, fixing bugs, and I'm getting, I'm getting flashbacks, to when Microsoft said, we want to launch Blockchain as a Service, with you, at DevCon one, and we were like, exactly, oh my god, like, that's, like, there are many parallels, nothing like a good deadline, to get, yes, exactly, especially with a big, you know, major partner, that you know, can make or break you, right, so, yeah, just don't have live demos, at the end of all of that, as well, yeah, exactly, that's when it gets real, risky, we actually, so, when we did it, there was, like, a funny bug, with the, like, the React stuff, um, so we were, like, live, like, helping, we were, like, literally, pushing fixes, it was, like, oh, we didn't know, I didn't expect that to happen, like, okay, one second, like, all right, it's deployed, just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[13:21] Lots of cash clearing, I remember, about that, I'm curious, what you see, as, like, the future of, just, generally, like, art, and NFTs.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[13:29] Can I jump in on this, yeah, please, take a, take on it, so, in DeFi, we're starting to see, like, as the administration has cleared the way, to some extent, it seems like, you know, there was a pent-up demand, for something, like, a TradFi, DeFi merger, it's not all the way there, yet, but it's, you know, getting to, just, be, five, like, I see the path, to that happening, do you think, like, it's NFTs, really, stay, sort of, like, a distinct asset class, forever, I know, you know, maybe you could talk about, your gallery, I know you started, to do, a lot of, like, physical sales, et cetera, like, does it, kind of, or, you know, do they merge, do they not, do they, yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[14:04] Like, like, trad art, become NFT art, and digital art, or, like.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[14:08] Yeah, I, you know, I, like, the NFT stuff, I do think, kind of, just, like, eventually, fades into the background, like, the real zero to one, is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance, so, you know, you could use that, for physical art, you could use it, for digital, I think, it was, like, more of a breakthrough, with digital, because you can, kind of, argue, the token is the art, you now have, this, you know, more liquid asset, um, so, for art, specifically, yeah, it's kind of, just, becoming, part of the market, and I think, you'll see, NFTs, you know, used, with digital art, obviously, but also, with physical art, like, no one's, really, if you, like, the lack of good data, on provenance, in the art market, and collectibles, in general, is, kind of, amazing, it's still, like, oh, there's a sticker, on the back, that says, it was from this gallery, probably, it was, probably, it was, nobody knows, and also, I think, you know, like, a lot of people, are, like, really trying, to tie, the physical asset, to the digital asset, which I think, is, a waste of time, personally, it's like, if you have, the physical asset, and you also, have custody, of the certificate, of authenticity, like, that's, kind of, good enough, you don't, really, need, some complicated, tech solution, there, and it's hard, to imagine, a world, in which, you know, like, collectors, and, like, customers, that, you just, want, like, I, personally, have, like, a higher, perceived value, for physical art, that, also, has an NFT, with it, yeah, um, and I think, in general, that trend, continues, so I think, digital art, will, kind of, just, become, a bigger part, of the contemporary art market, and then, eventually, we'll see, NFTs, used, as certificates, of authenticity, um, you know, for all, you know, high-value objects.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[15:42] Yeah, I mean, one of the big things, I didn't realize, is that, a friend of mine, is an artist, and she, often, gets a request, for the value, that was paid, for it, because someone wants to insure it, right, and there's this whole, downstream, kind of, economy.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:55] Yeah, insurance, appraisal, lending, you need, much better, and so, it's like, I mean, Kieran, you, and I, have talked, about, the lending stuff, a little bit, I think, the lending market, for these types of assets, is small, just, because, there's not, good information, you could, probably, really, grow, that pie, quite a bit, if you do, have easier access, to provenance information.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[16:16] Let me add, a little, on that front, so, I felt, having been, more of an NFT-style, RWA marketplace, for a while, and gone, more DeFi, I thought, that people, wanted, to tokenize, to sell things, at first, and this is true, but I think, it is better, that they tokenize, to unlock, liquidity, in selling, could be, one way, but people, kind of, want, to hold, on to stuff, like, I don't want, to sell, my ETH, I don't want, to sell, my, you know, et cetera, yeah, you would know, better, than us, at the very high end, of the market, you know, if you get, like, a wealth manager, they might, extend, some credit, against your Picasso, right, but for everybody else, and you probably, have to have, a lot of separate money, for that, too, you can't, really, like, I don't know, if people, fire sell, their art, but tends, to sit, there, and I used, to think, that was bad, but maybe, it should, sit, there, but the credit markets, actually, just, make it, liquid, you know, as we've, as we've discussed, before, which I think, would be, super cool, like, yeah, I'm surprised, we're getting, into that world, but we're not.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[17:20] Yeah, I think, we're seeing, it, I feel, like, there's, the green shoots, of, like, OK, here's, what's possible, it totally, makes sense, I think, just, like, NFTs, almost, this is, like, they're, a great, you know, like, we've talked, a lot of people, in crypto, love talking, about identity, and stuff, and like, to me, it's like, NFTs, are, like, a beautiful, very simple, digital identity, for whatever, you can pack, anything, you want, in that metadata, it's just, like, a packet, full of stuff, it's very simple, they're unique, they're pointers, to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[17:50] Yeah, I mean, I love, the way, you talk, about, NFTs, as certificates, of authenticity, because I didn't realize, this, we looked, into, like, the physical art market, for a while, and like, every auction, at Sotheby's, when they have, a big piece, like, they have, to research, it, effectively, from scratch, right, like, they have, to build, that entire chain, of provenance, with every piece, that they do, which is, an insane amount, of work, every single time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:14] Yeah, it's a very high friction process, like, the transactions, are very, very high friction, which is good, you know, like, depending, on where your position, is, in the market, like, obviously, Sotheby's, loves, being, the, you know, the keeper, of all secrets, and information, but I think, that's, clearly, going, to be, disintermediated, with technology.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[18:31] Any new assets, or maybe, are you guys, you know, just, to declare war, on the auction houses, houses, you know.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:36] Other high-end physical goods, what, uh, yeah, I mean, we're focusing, like, our expansion, like, you know, we launched, the gallery, earlier this year, um, offline gallery, it's on the Bowery, um, right next to New Museum, and, you know, we're showing, physical, digital art, you know, installations, you know, projections, all sorts of different things, and, yeah, I think, like, you know, our view, like, if you look, at the models, the galleries, are not doing, great business-wise, the auction houses, are hurting, I think, everyone's trying, to find, a more sustainable model.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[19:04] Stuff, is so illiquid, right, I don't mean, to interrupt, right, I think, the norm, is stuff, sitting, five years, 10 years, it's feast, or famine, if we print, a bunch, of money, probably, you get, a bunch, of transactions, you just, wait.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[19:17] 2021, people, were just, buying, Picassos, on their phones, online, and, crazy, ape, and crazy apes, right, so, yeah, everything, every year, like, Ether Rocks, I remember, when Ether Rocks, were, like, the price, is exploding, and I was, like, this is, truly, amazing, um, but, yeah, I think, like, the models, have to change, and, you know, just, as, like, if you think, what the internet's, done, as far, as, like, shopping, right, it's like, you can, price compare, easily, on your phone, in any stores, right, there's, no kind, of, like, price arbitrage, you're, like, you're, going, to look, up, the price, of something, you can, scan, something, figuring, it, like, ask ChatGPT, what is, what, is, this, how much, should it cost, and, so, I think, like, the art world, has, really, it has, been, like, an insider's, game, of who knows, who, and, like, what's, the real price, like, the marketed price, versus, like, what, was, actually, paid, and, I think, that's, gonna, like, it's, kind, of, slowly, like, unwinding, and we'll, end up, with, a market structure, where, pricing, is, just, much more, transparent, you can, see, things, on-chain, and, I mean, I think, that's, you know, like, that's, kind, of, like, part, of the opportunity, is, as, the market, becomes, more efficient, we'll, have, the best tools, to, to, service, the new structure.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[20:34] So, it sounds, like, even, the big guys, want, more liquidity, but they're, not willing, to, like, let go, of their, proprietary, information, advantage, I guess, yeah, yeah, exactly, and, I, but, it's, a nice, like, that's, a kind, of, also, the paradox, it's, like, you'll, have, more liquidity, if it's, better, access, to information, but, like, you know, it's, the classic, uh, what's, the, innovators, dilemma, the innovators, let me, exactly, I was, like, tip, my time, yeah, classic, innovators, dilemma.

**SPEAKER_03:**
