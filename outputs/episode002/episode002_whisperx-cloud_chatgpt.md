**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:01] All right, well, welcome back, everybody.
[00:03] The first episode of "The Early Days of Ethereum" actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter.
[00:09] I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video.
[00:14] And there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content.
[00:19] One of them called it, you know, "essential viewing."
[00:21] So anyway, we're back for another episode.

[00:24] So, to remind everybody, I'm Kieran James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders.
[00:29] Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:31] Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:35] I'm James Hormuzdiar, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[00:39] All right, thank you.
[00:40] And so, I believe where we left—so I can't watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode.
[00:46] But I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch.
[00:49] And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity.
[00:57] So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:04] Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building, you know, what in those days were known as dapps.
[01:10] I guess some people still call it that, but that seems to have gone out of favor in favor of "blockchain applications."
[01:15] So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum.

[01:20] And that was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small co-working space in Greenpoint, I think.
[01:26] I would say it was on Water Street.
[01:28] Yeah, it was called Green Desk, maybe?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:30] Green Desk, yeah, that's right.
[01:32] It's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:36] Exactly, yeah, that's right.
[01:37] And of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time.
[01:40] In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise.
[01:43] I looked up one day and there was this big, well-manicured park there.
[01:46] They kind of walled it off, and so it just was like—I don't know, I thought it was like an abandoned site.
[01:51] And then one day, all of a sudden, the wall was gone and there was a beautiful park there.

[01:55] So at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting.
[02:02] People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer.
[02:07] And ConsenSys at this point was only like maybe 20 people at max.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[02:11] 20 or 30, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:12] That's interesting.
[02:13] It was really, really small, and some great concepts came up.
[02:17] But even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time.
[02:22] Like, it was just impossible.
[02:24] Very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible.
[02:28] You couldn't read the state off the blockchain and all this kind of stuff.

[02:32] So that kind of led into—yeah, like everything building in those days was incredibly hard.
[02:37] And that led into—so we decided at that event we were going to, at the launch of Ethereum, do a bigger hackathon.
[02:44] And that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

[02:49] And it was us, the Java client, which I think was called Ether.Camp at that time, and other tools that were kind of combined together.
[02:56] But what was really interesting about that one was—it was bigger.
[02:59] I think the first one we had like six participants.
[03:02] The other one we had like, I think, close to 30.

[03:05] But it introduced a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly.
[03:09] Like, the winner was a GameFi app.
[03:11] It really had that element of tokenized gameplay.
[03:14] There was a decentralized social app, I think called Truther or something like that.
[03:18] And then there was a traceability supply chain app in those early days.
[03:22] And that kind of all coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[03:26] Yeah, so you're talking about the second one.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:28] I'm talking about the second one, yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[03:29] The second one—also, the offices had shifted.
[03:32] So we had—our ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick.
[03:39] Which is—I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote.
[03:43] I remember there was like a horse lineage app.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:46] Yeah, yeah, interesting.
[03:47] And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon.
[03:51] But that one was open to externals, right?
[03:54] So that was the big difference.
[03:56] And it actually was quite well attended.
[03:58] The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:04] Do you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:07] I think it was two days.
[04:08] So we moved into that space to have the hackathon.
[04:11] ConsenSys was planning because they had outgrown that co-working space already.
[04:15] And so we moved into that space, which was a reasonably sized room.
[04:18] You could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room.
[04:21] But yes, the air conditioning was terrible.
[04:23] And we had to frantically—we only realized this after we got into the room.
[04:27] So we had to frantically buy something, set them up.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:30] Okay, I do have a memory of that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:32] Yeah, I don't know if you recall that.
[04:33] But yeah, we were trying to get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up.
[04:38] Because yeah, we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.
[04:42] These were the scrappy days.
[04:44] Manually configuring air conditioning.
[04:46] I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for where you are in your startup journey.
[04:51] There was a lot of furniture.
[04:52] I mean, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there.
[04:55] And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started.
[04:59] So we had to get everything up and running.

[05:01] And it was this to sort of commemorate the launch, I think?
[05:04] Or was it like right before the launch?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[05:06] It was right—it actually—you know, if you recall at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be.
[05:11] The dates were always shifting, right?
[05:13] And we just said—we kind of arbitrarily chose—we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch.
[05:18] But because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague.
[05:24] Like, we were like, "Exactly what actually happens?"
[05:27] So we at some point had to arbitrarily choose the date.
[05:30] And they more or less—it was the right date.
[05:32] I think it was off by maybe a day or two.
