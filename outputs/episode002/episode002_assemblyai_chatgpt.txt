**SPEAKER_00:**
All right, well, welcome back, everybody.
The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter.
I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video.
And there have been a few people who reached out, who we've known a long time, who really appreciated the content.
One of them called it, you know, essential viewing.
So anyway, we're back for another episode.
So remind everybody, I'm KIERAN James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders.
Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, okay.
I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm James Hermos DIA, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
All right, thank you.
And so I believe where we left—
So I can't watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch.
And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity.
So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building—
You know, what in those days were known as dapps.
I guess some people still call it that, but that seems to have gone out of favor with "blockchain applications."
So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum.
And that was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small co-working space in Greenpoint.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think it was on Water Street.
It was called Green Desks, maybe Green Ducks?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, it's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Exactly.
Yeah, that's right.
And of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time.
In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise.
I looked up one day and there was like a big, kind of well-manicured park there.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, well, they kind of walled it off and so it just was like—
I don't know, I thought it was like an abandoned site.
And then one day all of a sudden the wall was gone and there was a beautiful—

**SPEAKER_01:**
So at that event, which was I think two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum—
I will say the concepts were really interesting.
People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer.
And ConsenSys at this point was only like maybe 20 people at max.

**SPEAKER_00:**
20 or 30.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, it was really, really small.
And some great concepts came up.
But even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time.
Like, it was just impossible.
Very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible.
Like, you could read the state off the blockchain, all this kind of stuff.
So that kind of led into—
Yeah, everything building in those days was incredibly hard.
And that led into—
So we decided at that event we were going to, at the launch of Ethereum, do a bigger hackathon.
And that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which kind of coincided with the launch of Ethereum.
And it was us, the Java client, which I think was called EtherCamp at that time, and other tools that were kind of combined together.
But what was really interesting about that one was it was bigger.
I think the first one we had like six participants.
The other one we had, I think, close to 30.
But it introduced a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly.
Like, the winner was a GameFi app.
It really had that element of tokenized gameplay.
There was a decentralized social app, I think called Truther or something like that.
And then there was a traceability supply chain app in those early days.
And that kind of all coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
So you're talking about the second one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm talking about the second one.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, the second one.
Also, the offices had shifted.
So ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick.
I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote.
I remember there was like a horse lineage app.
Yeah, pretty interesting.
And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon.
But that one was open to externals, right?
So that was the big difference.
And it actually was quite well attended.
The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall.
And do you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days?
I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think it was two days.
And yeah, like the air conditioning thing—
So we moved into that space to have the hackathon.
ConsenSys was planning because they had outgrown that co-working space already.
And so we moved into that space, which was a reasonably sized room.
You could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room.
But yes, the air conditioning was terrible and we had to frantically—
We only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to frantically buy some and set them up.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, I do have a memory of that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, I don't know if you recall that, but yeah, we were trying to get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up because we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

**SPEAKER_00:**
These were the scrappy days.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Manually configuring air conditioning.
I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for where you are in your startup journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There was a lot of furniture.
I mean, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there.
And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started to get everything running.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And was this to sort of commemorate the launch, I think?
Or was it like right before the launch?

**SPEAKER_01:**
It was right—
Actually, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be.
The dates were always shifting.
And we just said—
We kind of arbitrarily chose—
We wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was—
And even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague.
We were like, is that going to actually happen?
So we kind of at some point had to arbitrarily choose the date.
And they more or less—
It was the right date.
I think it was off by maybe a day or two.
