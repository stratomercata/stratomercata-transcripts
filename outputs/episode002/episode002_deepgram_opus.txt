**SPEAKER_00:**
Alright. Well, welcome back, everybody. The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for our first video. And there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So, anyway, we're back for another episode.

So remind everybody, I'm Kieran James, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders. Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alright. Thank you. And so I believe where we left, so I can't watch video of myself. So I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch. And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after launch activity.

So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. So that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building, you know, what in those days were known as dapps. I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go now in favor with blockchain applications. So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum. And that was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small coworking space in, like, Greenpoint, I think. I'm gonna say it was Water Street.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. It was called Green Desks, maybe?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Green Desks. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. It's right next to the modern day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Exactly. Yeah. That's right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So and it, of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time. In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise. I'd, like, looked up one day, and there was, like, a big kind of well manicured park there. Yeah. Well, they kind of walled it off, and so it just was like, I don't know. I thought it was, like, an abandoned site. And then one day, all of sudden, the wall was gone, and there was a beautiful park there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So at that event, you know, which was, I think, two months, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say not the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys at this point was only, like, maybe 20 people at max. Like, was really, really small.

And, you know, some great concepts came up, but, like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. Like, it was just impossible. Like, very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. Like, you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, all of this kind of stuff.

So that kind of led into, yeah, like, everything building in those days was incredibly hard. And that led into, so we decided at that event, we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were gonna do a bigger hackathon. And that became the second ConsenSys dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

And it was us, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ethereum J at that time, and, like, other tools that were kind of combined together. But what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger. Like, I think the first one, we had, like, six participants. The other one, we had, like, I think close to 30.

And but it introduced, like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly. Like, the winner was a GameFi app. Like, it really had that element of tokenized gameplay. There was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther or something like that. And then there was, like, a traceability supply chain app in those early days, and that kind of all coincided with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. So okay. In this, so you're talking about the second one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm talking about the second one. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The second one, also, the offices had shifted. So, we had, or ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote.

I remember there was, like, a horse lineage app. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty interesting. You know? And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was open to externals. Right? So that was the big difference. And it actually was, you know, quite well attended.

The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall. And you think that one was, like, twenty four hours, or it was two days? I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It was two days. And, yeah, like, the air conditioning thing. So we moved into that space to have the hackathon. Like, you know, ConsenSys was blank because they had outgrown that coworking space already. And so we moved into that space, which, yeah. It was a reasonably sized room. Like, you could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room. Right?

But, yes, the air conditioning was terrible, and we had to frantically, we only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to, like, frantically buy some and set them up.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. I do have a memory of that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know if you recall that, but, yeah, we were, like, trying to, like, get those air conditioning units in place before, like, a ton of people showed up. Because, yeah, like, we were sweating when there were only, like, five people in the room.

**SPEAKER_00:**
These were the scrappy days. Yeah. Manually configuring air condition. I think the amount of, like, furniture assembly that you do is, like, a good proxy for how scrappy you are in your startup journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There was a lot of furniture. I mean, we kept, like, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there. And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, so we had to get everything up and running.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And it was this to, like, sort of commemorate the launch, I think, or was it, like, right before the launch?

**SPEAKER_01:**
It was right, it actually, you know, if you recall at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be. Like, the dates were always shifting. Right? And we just said, we can't, we arbitrarily chose, like, we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was. And even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague. Like, we're like, is that gonna actually happen? So we kind of, at some point, had to arbitrarily choose the date, and it more or less was the right date. Like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Jim, I might have asked you this last episode, but I'll ask again. Do you remember, one, trying to predict the launch, and could you explain how? And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen because it's hard for, like, a decentralized group to decide on a launch time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I can't remember that at all. You were mentioning it in the last video, and I didn't remember this, but I don't doubt it. It sounds correct.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I am. You were saying we were looking through the Git commits at the time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
We were. Yes. You know, you made this plot. It was, like, commits by day, and I was, like, the commits and you, like, extrapolated it forward. I think probably got within a couple days of the launch date.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But okay. So I have to, yeah. I still don't know how they, like, set the clock on the first block, so to speak. Maybe we can, like, dig this up. There was something they did, and that we had.

**SPEAKER_02:**
It's probably in our DMs. I wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had. Maybe the graph is in there. Yeah. Yeah. That's very funny. The Slack is a treasure trove of interesting things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alright. So yeah. So it launched, and I kinda felt like there was a sort of, and then what's going on? You know? It took a little time for things to get going. And then, you know, this, it obviously, it's just been a smashing success. Right? It's just sort of the reality of a new platform. You sort of get it out there. You see what people do. You learn from it. And, you know, it took a minute for the activity to kick in.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Remember, like, a lot of people around us at the time had been buying a lot of presale ether beforehand. And so the day it came out, I think they were expecting it to, like, have a huge jump in value immediately. And when, like, you know, a couple weeks had gone by and it was only still, like, 20 cents an ether or so, remember people around us were kinda like, some of the people there were like, oh, this thing was a flop. It's never gonna go anywhere.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I mean, it's just psychologically, yeah. The expectations were super high. There was this concept floating around ConsenSys of day one dapps. Like, you had to be ready right for the launch because, you know, it was a land grab and things were going to the moon. And, you know, it turned out to, you know, not quite be, obviously, again, smashing success. But, yeah, the price is, like, under a dollar for a little bit, and then around a dollar for, like, a while, I believe.

And I did wanna mention, so I had to look this up. So the first ICO, whatever you wanna call it, that was on Ethereum, obviously, Ethereum did its own crowdsale, but it was like, you know, they took in Bitcoin, and there was something like 2,000 ether to 1 Bitcoin at the time, which I believe at the time was, like, 20 or 30 cents, and then it had gone up to a dollar on launch. It's already a pretty good return. You know? But that is what it is.

The first ICO apparently was Augur. And I knew the Augur guys a little bit. I was digging through the Crypto Economicon videos. I believe one or two of them presented or ran panels at Crypto Economicon.

For folks who are listening to this, Crypto Economicon was a conference that we had in January 2015 that involved a lot of the people who then, including Vitalik and some of the other Ethereum folks, then subsequently created really big and interesting, mostly layer one projects in the Ethereum space, but others as well. So the videos are actually up. I tweeted a couple of them, but there was apparently, I think I created a YouTube channel, like, in 2015 and uploaded all those. I definitely remember getting them recorded. So check those out if that's of interest.

So Augur was the first, I guess, of the prediction markets platforms. They've, there since have been a couple of new ones that have popped up that seem to be popular. There was also this sort of competing project called Truthcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I was kind of confused about how the two related to each other. I think there was no formal relation, though. I remember meeting up. This guy named Matt Liston I met who I checked his LinkedIn. He's been in a few different places.

So I think Augur, maybe we should look up who actually founded Augur. So Jeremy Gardner, I, you know, I've known over the years. And he, I met him in San Francisco with Vitalik because Vitalik was staying at what was termed at the time the Crypto Castle. And, you know, it's kind of what you would imagine, sort of like a coworking, co-living crypto space for, and not everyone there was working on Augur. They're all working on different things and kind of common thing to do.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, I think if you hear the term crypto castle now, people would imagine an actual castle. It's, you know, what you're describing, which is more like a dormitory.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It, yes. It was more like a dorm. I mean, it was a nice little house. I can't remember. It might have been, like, adjacent to the Mission in San Francisco.

And so Vitalik would stay there sometimes. Joey Krug, we have probably met two or three times over the years. I'm not even sure if I ever met Jack Peterson. So those are the three founders of Augur. I guess they had, you know, they were good friends with Vitalik or just sort of had realized early on that it would be easier to develop on Ethereum than it would be to try to do something with Bitcoin, which was kind of the predominant suggestion at the time.

But they did the first on Ethereum crowdfund, like, I guess right after launch. The Wikipedia is saying August 2015, which is really, really early. I don't know if I believe this Wikipedia page. It says, soon after the platform launched, users had created death pools or assassination markets on famous people.

So back in 2015, every discussion about blockchain eventually led both to prediction markets and then this sort of uncensorability, you can't shut it down, would lead then to assassination markets. Assassination markets being you predict, you bet on the day someone dies. You know? And then someone takes the other side of that bet, kills them, and collects on it.

So, apparently, there actually were assassination markets created on Ethereum. According to this Wikipedia page, I'm, yeah. I have to look into that. I'm a little bit dubious. But in any case, I guess, Ethereum then blazed the trail sort of after Ethereum did with its successful crowdsale for the wave of ICOs that came later.

But yeah. So Truthcoin was also this competing project. I just remember meeting up with Matt at, like, a Berkeley coffee shop and talking about both Augur and Truthcoin had some sort of, you know, machine learning, slightly, like, computer science graph theoretic way of, like, determining what the truth was.

So, like, you take a bunch of votes from a bunch of people, but then determine the principal components of how the voting is then extract the truth from there. So it sounded like very, you know, high end math mechanistic, which was very common of the space.

Ever, like, you know, the crypto has a lot of these, like, and I was in the math department in Berkeley. A lot of these, like, mathematician types who, like, kinda came in and wanted to create, like, really complicated schemes and mechanisms and all that sort of stuff, that had provable theoretical properties for something interesting about, you know, this space.

But yeah. So they must have launched it, like, right away. That's very interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Remember us talking to them at some point, and they were developing that. Like, they did want to be a day one dapp, I remember. And they were, I think the first went live 2018, the Wikipedia page says, but they did the crowdsale, like, basically right away.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So should we go on to DevCon one? Which I guess I can talk about.

So kinda concurrently while all this is happening, we started to work a bunch. So ConsenSys had a business development team, little bit of a mix of marketing BD, actual sales, you know, etcetera, that was starting to generate interest from big companies in the technology.

So, you know, for us ourselves, we definitely worked with companies far more than sort of the crypto public for, you know, most of the history of the company. Still don't really work with the crypto public today. But, you know, ConsenSys was kind of conflicted on this front.

So they, you know, while they had sort of pure blockchain native projects in eventually in big numbers, they also had an enterprise arm, which is really more consulting oriented. Although they kind of ended up sort of backfilling what they saw demand for with products at times.

But in any case, the BD folks were reaching out to everybody, and they actually got a fair bit of interest from Microsoft. And I think Microsoft had already been kinda watching the Ethereum revolution and, you know, seeing it as something interesting, you know, the new front of the cloud war perhaps.

And so, you know, we got to working with them. And, actually, maybe for the technical part of this, I could kinda transition. But, basically so ConsenSys had a couple, you know, preferred projects which had the low level, you know, like low level, I mean, like, the blockchain client itself, infrastructure that could be deployed on cloud platforms.

And maybe yeah. So that ended up being basically us and the, you know, the Java folks. Vic, do you wanna, you know, take any, I think you were saying before...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Sure. So, like, they so they were interested in kind of being able to deploy a one of the clients that we had, you know, we had the Haskell client and then the Java folks. They were actually more interested in the Java folks.

Wait. I should take a step back here. Just mentioning that DevCon one almost didn't happen if you recall. Right? Because it was in this low period, and the Ethereum Foundation was kind of running out of money because, you know, this is why the launch had to happen when it happened.

And in that low period, they were, like, you know, still trying to preserve a lot of cash. And so it almost didn't happen. And I remember, like, a lot of people inside ConsenSys were like, no. Like, we have to, like, bring this to kind of bring this up and make an event out of this. You know? Like, I think Andrew Keys was leading the charge in that, really saying, like, we got to do this.

And then this Microsoft thing kind of bundled into that. Right? So it was us and the Java client. And my background was, like, you know, in my previous company, I had tried to work with Microsoft in building apps, like, when they had their first mobile platform, and it took me, like, six months to get a meeting, and I had a cousin who was, like, a VP at Microsoft.

So it was really, so it was amazing to me that they were just coming to us, and they wanted to launch something with us in two months. And I think at that point, we, like, we decided, okay. This is a huge opportunity. We're gonna drop everything and focus on that launch, which turned out to be the launch of blockchain as a service.

And but oddly enough, the Java guys started, and then they just kind of faded away. Like, they weren't really interested in kind of pursuing it. They just had other things going on. So we, like, went over it. So by the time DevCon one happened, the only thing that was working was, you know, our client on, it was ready on the cloud. You could download it, and you could start building on it right away. And then remember, like, we started to get, like, downloads immediately. People started to get, you know, people using it immediately.

But that's also in that run up, that was, like, when kind of we realized or Microsoft realized, like, if we're gonna make this as a developer tool, it can't, you know, neck to the public Ethereum network because people wouldn't be able to get ether. Like, it was quite hard to get ether at that point. There weren't really that many exchanges or anything to go on.

So we were, that's kind of how we kind of created, like, private Ethereum, you know, and private enterprise. What became known as private Ethereum or enterprise Ethereum. So that kind of all led up. And then the launch itself in London, when we got up with Microsoft, I think people were shocked that Microsoft was into it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You know, so I just looked that up and didn't have in our little outline, but I had forgotten about this. So I think Coinbase listed ether, like, mid twenty sixteen. Right? I'm seeing 05/24/2016. So and I guess, like, Kraken was the popular exchange at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think it was Poloniex. I'm sorry. You're right. Yeah. Poloniex, still exists. And I just remember there was, like, the chat function on Poloniex. It's like, man. Like, that was, like, crazy. Like, that was Discord before there was Discord.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Oh, wait. Hold on. Circle bought it maybe, and then it seems to have shut it down. Anyway, I'm confused by all this.

**SPEAKER_01:**
But, so it was, like, it was sketchy for sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It was like a whale chat box. I never really used it, but I would, like, see it on people's computers and all that sort of thing. It was difficult to get in and out of ether for a while. Jim, are you gonna say something?

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm just kind of remembering back then. Remind me because I'm sort of, like, not sure if I've got this right, but I sort of, I think maybe you're downplaying the Java thing a little bit. I think if I remember right, Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time. Am I misremembering that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
No. You're not. They really wanted something that they could pitch to companies. And, you know, like, just, you know, companies use Java. Right? So they were, like, really, and so, like, when we kind of, like, were, like, we just dropped everything and just focused on that. And I remember, like, we sort of had the internal mantra, like, we gotta get on stage and be able to write a dapp in, like, thirty seconds. Like, that was our internal magic.

**SPEAKER_02:**
They had, like, preannounced something or something, and then the Java guys sort of disappeared or something, if ever.

**SPEAKER_01:**
They preannounced that, you know, they were gonna show, like, the Java client and the Haskell client, and we were like, this, we were like the runner-up. Like, they were like, I think they kind of accepted us because we were willing to work really hard, and the Java, like, I think they knew that they needed a backup.

**SPEAKER_02:**
The other thing I remember about Microsoft is that there was a little bit of, like, tension within there because there were the, they were just launching Azure at that time. Yeah. And at the same time, they had blockchain people. And the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it, and the Azure people wanted to, like, use this as a way to promote the new platform. So there was always a little bit of friction within.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, like, I remember, like, I think they're, you know, Marley Gray was really driving those efforts inside Microsoft at the time and they all were tethered. Like, they were, like, really, really pushing it. And I remember, like, they were trying to get people in the room to talk to us, and some of them wouldn't even go in the room.

Like, I mean, it was probably like you said, they were launching Azure, so that's a huge project. I'm sure they were just busy with other stuff, but we spent a lot of time in their New York office. I remember we were, like, going there all the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I'm seeing the Azure launches 2010. I checked it, but it did feel much more nascent than it is today. Like, Amazon got out. AWS got out there and, like, took the whole market, and then Azure was kind of, like, in a catch up mode. But I think it might have even, like, exceeded AWS revenues at some point.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Running around one of the conferences, I can't remember which one, handing out free passes to Azure to everybody. It was that conference. DevCon one. Okay. Yeah. They were handing it out, and that's why they wanted to make sure we were on their marketplace. So, like, they could hand out this free pass, and you could get the, you know, you could get our client up and running and start building something right away.

And that was, like, a revelation to a lot of people. I remember, like, dozens of companies were, like, starting in that first week.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Their devious plan worked on us. They, we grabbed a whole bunch of free passes, and then a year later, we were, like, giving them, like, $10,000 a month to stay on.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It definitely works. Oh, I get you. Yeah. But I don't know if you remember, like, the day after the Microsoft announcement, there was a spike in the price, and we were like, I think we just did that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The price, you mean the Microsoft stock price?

**SPEAKER_01:**
No. No. No. I meant the Ethereum price.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The enterprise.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think it was both, actually. Yeah. I think they both went up, and we were like, hey. I think we actually did that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But so, like, ether went from 20 cents to 30 cents?

**SPEAKER_01:**
No. I think it actually went significantly up. I remember, like, it was, I think it might have, like, doubled for a day or something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
20 cents to 40 cents?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Maybe, I think it was like a dollar to a dollar 80 or I don't remember the price.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Oh, check it out. It's hard to see. It's funny the price range is like so. Yes, because the price is low. Okay, so it's interesting. Right? So DevCon's, like, December. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's around a dollar. Yeah. There it is. New era starts taking up. Like, yeah. And I think we definitely got calls related to the Microsoft announcement into January.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So we probably had something to do with it. Yeah. You never know what really was causing price action. But...

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm joking, but I just remember, like, sort of the mentality within was that until it was up to $20, people thought it was a flop. And somehow when it hit $20, everybody around me all of a sudden got really excited then.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yep. The average person, you know, buys high, sells low. So yeah. That's pretty successful at 20, and it was still low.

Okay. So moving along, kind of on the back of the enterprise announcement, sorry. The Microsoft announcement, we started to get customers. And a lot of it was, like, enterprises that were fairly early in their journey and, you know, wanted just some advice on blockchain technology. Some of them were actually ready to implement something.

I don't, Vic. You took a whole lot of phone calls. You know?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, man.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You know? Do you wanna comment on any of that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I mean, it was kind of amazing. Like, now the numbers in relative size seem pretty small. But in the first couple months, we went from zero to, like, dozens of companies calling us. Right? And the amazing thing to me was they had actually tried our software. Like, they had played around.

And, like, I remember over and over, people were like, oh, you know, like, we've been working on blockchain project for the last two years and haven't been able to build anything, and now we can do something. Right? So I remember, like, we were getting them from financial companies and, like, you know, resource company and mining companies, and, like, it was, like, all across the spectrum of people trying things. Because I don't think they really knew what they wanted to do, but they wanted an easy way to get in, and for the first time, they had it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Gotcha. Do you remember, so I believe, I'm trying to keep this straight. So I remember the project Slockit was sort of being marketed at DevCon one, but I believe it's a lot of the same people as the DAO. And do you remember, like, I think they used it, but I can't, I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So Slockit was this sort of IoT kind of strange thing that you could unlock a lock, but they, it was structured around what actually became the DAO. Like, they, I think they invented the concept, not the concept, but I think they practically created a DAO in order to their own this lock.

And then they realized, well, you know, I think they realized, well, we don't actually need the lock. Like, the DAO is the most important thing, and the lock, the actual lock thing is not that interesting. So, yeah, it was 100% the same people. Like, they were introducing both ideas at the same time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So let me transition into the DAO part. I'm gonna go slightly out of order here. So, Victor, what was the DAO?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So the DAO was basically, it was kind of like an investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Right? So, basically, people would put, like, money into this contract, and this contract would basically fund. The goal of it was it would fund different projects.

But it started to, like, consume a huge amount of, you know, the overall ether supply. I think it was as high as, like, 20 or 25% of the entire ether supply got locked up into this contract.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I'm looking on the Wikipedia right now. So the part of the reason I thought of it in this sequence is, like, looking at the price action. Part of it is that the supply, the extant ether supply went down because, oh, okay.

So as of May 2016, the DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all ether tokens issued to date. So they ran a crowdsale, and crowdsale raised $34,000,000. 34,000,000 by 05/10/2016. More than 50 by May 12, over 100 by May 15.

So sometimes the dynamics of these ICOs, this is one thing, one, it's kinda crazy. But, like, one thing that blockchain seems to do that are, it's really difficult to do with other technologies is to have this sort of really large scale collaboration, and in this case, to pool capital, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yep.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So I suppose there was some sort of virality going on. People are talking about the DAO, and you just see this, like, enormous movement of funds sort of overnight.

And you know? So okay. By, they end up holding by 05/21/2016 over $150,000,000 in ether from over 10,000 people, which is about, it says, according to the article, about 14% of all ether tokens issued at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. So it was really fast. Right? Like, it took everybody by surprise. I remember I think I had a meeting that the enterprise folks at ConsenSys had set up with, I'm say, the people at BBVA. I'm forgetting last names, but I think it was, like, Scarlet and Carlos. I don't think you went to this one, Vic. I think you were in town.

But they were just like, it just caught everyone's attention. It was crazy. You know? And they were, we were talking a bit about, like, operational use cases for the bank. But then there was also, like, the, you know, the, there was a sense that, like, this is where the future is. Like, the money just moved. You know?

Like, you, there were no really, you know, there's heavy subscription agreements and, you know, all that sort of thing. And, you know, it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years.

Yeah. So by June, the people discovered that you could exploit the DAO to siphon off the funds. Yeah. Do you know anything about that beyond, you know, it was crazy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So there were, so you had all the supply locked into this contract, and I think the hack was, like, yeah. So there was this massive race between, there was a flaw in the contract logic, and because it's immutable, the smart contract couldn't be changed. Right?

And when people realized, there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on the DAO itself. So it was like this, and but the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it. Like, I think, I don't remember the number, but I think it was, like, a huge amount of the value they were able to pull that out.

Yeah. Now the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account, and everyone knew where it went because, you know, everything on the blockchain is completely transparent. But no one could do anything about it. Like, they couldn't take the money out, and so the money was just sitting there, basically, that got, like, it was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something, and no one knew what to do about this situation.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Yeah. And so okay. I'm kind of looking back on it. So it was yeah. It blew up, and it also caused the creation. So I remember there was a, at this time, a, and we had to implement this in our software, a hard fork debate because, so it's pretty early. It's, like, less than a year after Ethereum launched.

Probably a lot of the, you know, big ether holders participated in this. You know, they've lost significant funds, maybe all of their funds. And the question was, like, do you make people whole, or do you stick true to the absolute, you know, immutability in the classic blockchain sense where, you know, it's totally buyer beware. Shouldn't have put your ether in this contract if you weren't gonna, you know, if you weren't prepared to lose it.

And the refund group won. You know? So in a sense, I mean, both, like, Ethereum, Bitcoin, really all the projects are governed to an extent, right, by the people who develop the software and kind of, on an ongoing basis, discuss additions to the protocol, you know, etcetera, etcetera. Right?

And, you know, even in the early days of Bitcoin, I was not really around for this, but supposedly, they had to be extremely creative about having, about keeping the protocol running while not ever reverting any of the history. Right?

So I don't believe they did, they've ever done a hard fork of the nature described here, though there have been, maybe not sponsored by the founders. Obviously, there are forks of Bitcoin now, Bitcoin Cash, you know, all that sort of thing.

And so the Ethereum community elected to, or the foundation or whatever that is, the elected to sort of forcibly revert the funds. There's just like a almost like a credit as of a certain block number. So everyone got their funds back. Jim had to code it. Maybe I helped a little bit. I was not coding anymore at this point.

And so then Ethereum Classic was, like, the hard line. Like, we're sticking the immutability. Sorry, Jim. Are you gonna say something?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, no. I think you were gonna say something.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No. No. No. And so Ethereum Classic got some backers. You know, I think maybe famously, I think Barry Silbert was in Ethereum Classic, maybe still is.

And, eventually, it was, yeah, I think someday Victor, you told me this. Right? Someday later, it had a hard fork itself, right, when some issue was discovered with the protocol. Is that correct?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think, I don't know if it was a hard fork or a soft fork, but, yeah, there have been, like, you know, there have been debates inside, there have been debates inside the Ethereum Classic community too on how to implement different changes into the protocol. Right? It's not just running. Like, there's constantly...

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think Bob of the Ethereum Classic Collective knows more about this stuff than I do. Interesting. Yeah. Maybe I could follow-up on exactly how this went down.

But I think also, I think Ethereum Classic maybe was mining forever philosophically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Whereas Ethereum switched over to proof of stake, like, a year ago, you know, a year and a... So, yeah, they were more kind of, oh, there was okay. Yeah. No. I just googled it. Here's a June 28 Cointelegraph article that says Ethereum Classic Devs announced upcoming hard fork, yada yada.

So they at least subsequently did some amount of hard forking, but, you know, interesting, nonetheless.

Funny thing also when this hard fork happens, right, it's, you know, you don't, this is a silly comment, from someone who's, you know, fairly compliance focused. Right? Like, what's the tax treatment of a hard fork? Like, you had some, say you had some tokens on one chain, and then they morph, and now you have tokens on both chains.

I think it's like airdrops too or, like, ordinary income, which means whether or not you wanted those hard fork coins, you know, you probably have to pay taxes on them if you can access and liquidate them. But you have to pay them whether or not you liquidate. It's not just capital gains. You know?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, oh, interesting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Quite a strange test of our system that we've seen with blockchain because, you know, they fork all the time. There's lots of airdrops, etcetera. You might not even be aware.

Alright. So that was the DAO. I wanna, yeah. This is crazy. Like, I still kind of can't believe this happened. And it's happened way bigger and differently later. But, you know, it's yeah. I...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, I looked up the current price, and in current dollars, it would be roughly the equivalent of $30,000,000,000. Yeah. Like, yeah. If you think about it. So, yeah, it'd be huge, you know, like, because just Ethereum was so small at the time. Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yep. Okay. I wanna take you to the second CoinDesk Consensus hackathon and, again, hand it to Victor for everything you recall. Also, we have some pictures from that time. Do you, if we could just show some of that on screen if you...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I found it from CoinDesk. Let me see if I can still find them. But so what I remember of it is that it was, I think it was one of the first CoinDesk Consensus events, which, you know, subsequently became huge.

And then so they kind of had two events around it. One was a hackathon, which we were part of, and then, and we were running, we were, like, one of the main platforms that was participating in it. And then there was the event itself, which was, I think, at the Ritz. It like, both events were in Times Square.

Like, the hackathon came first at Microsoft in Times Square, and then the event was kind of, you know, a couple blocks away in the hotel. And I remember that, like, during the hackathon itself, we were all in these, like, different conference rooms that and there was, you know, like, early Hyperledger and some other, I can't remember who the other clients were, but they were, like, competing clients that were not Ethereum based.

And there was a pretty good turnout. I think, like, over 100 people showed up. Like, a lot of people kind of showed up. And our room got so crowded, we had to, like, co-opt another boardroom in order to kind of, like, build.

So, like, I think we got, like, a significant majority of the developers building stuff on our platform, which was super exciting. And I remember kind of walking by the rooms that, like, Hyperledger had had or I'm trying to remember what the other client had had, and, like, you know, there weren't very many people in there. It seemed like the people that were in there were, like, people who were working for them.

So that was really, really exciting. Though at the end, we didn't win. At least someone building on our stack didn't win because I think the winner was actually something that was getting built way before that hackathon existed, which was, you know, technically against the rules, but we didn't, we didn't hold anyone to the...

**SPEAKER_00:**
This is Victor asserts, if we lost, it's because someone else cheated. So exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we feel. That's at least how I felt at the time. Whether or not that's completely true, it's, you know, that memory is subjective. That's all I'm saying. Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
And the rest of the conference.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, and then the rest of the conference. So that, I think, was, like, the first shiny big blockchain conference. Right? Like, you know, you had, I remember speaking. They launched, I think, the first Hyperledger app there and a bunch of, you know, there was a bunch of activity.

Like, it was a really interesting combination because most of the other conferences like DevCon are really developer focused, but this you could really see a lot of businesses becoming interested in.

And the thing I most remember about that conference is that we were, like, pulled into a room at one point, and that room was basically, in the room was the head of Hyperledger, John Wolpert, and Vitalik were in that room.

And they were like, hey. We heard that you guys have an enterprise ready version of Ethereum that, you know, can switch between the public net and, like, private blockchains. Right?

And, like, I remember at the time was like, my engineers claim that this is completely impossible. Like, and, Jim, I think you, like, booted up your laptop, and you're like, here it is. Like, I'm gonna show you. Like, this is how it works, and, you know, like, you can start building on it and everything.

And there was this conversation going back and forth between Wolpert and Vitalik about, I think, Hyperledger supporting Ethereum. And it kind of ended, what I remember of it was it ended with, I think Vitalik was, you know, he always wears an Ethereum T-shirt. Right? And Wolpert is about three sizes larger than Vitalik.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Interesting. I think Vitalik is very tall.

**SPEAKER_01:**
John's stockier, substantially. If they had a bench press competition, I expect there would be a pretty big differentiation, you know, in what John could bench and what Vitalik could bench.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I think you're right. Like, it's not, we're not talking that John is unfit. He's just, like, much larger than Vitalik. He's, what, at, you know, still quite skinny. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, like, John was, like, three sizes before, and I think it was Andrew Keys that, like, pointed to the T-shirt and, like, Vitalik, take that shirt off and give it to John because he was about to walk on stage, and, like, it was, like, a muscle shirt on him. It was, like, so tight, you know, it was like a compression shirt.

And he went on stage and that was like, you know, people were kind of shocked that like, hey, what's going on? Like, this is head of Hyperledger in an Ethereum T-shirt. And it's interesting because what eventually that led to Hyperledger actually supporting Ethereum type clients like Besu.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I would add, in talking to obviously, we spoke to John occasionally over the years, and he actually went on to join ConsenSys later. I don't really know what he's up to today. I don't think he's there anymore.

But, he had, sort of a sense of, like, not wanting to be on the wrong side of history. Like, he always wanted to talk about, he was always talking about, like, IBM's embrace of Linux as instead of, like, pushing really hard on a continual basis with its own operating system.

So they just put a ton of open source software development in Linux, and, of course, it probably helped them, you know, have something to run on their mainframes, which is still actually a big business for them today.

And so he was always, like, debating back and forth, like, should we do our own thing? And it was at least mostly open source. Should we go the, you know, the Ethereum way? What do we do?

And, I think this was, you know, like, perhaps the best illustration of that conflict. I think IBM has since, you know, it's, it was formidable for a while and sort of scary as a competitor and all that sort of thing. And I don't hear that much blockchain noise out of them anymore. I think they've shifted resources and all that sort of thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
By the way, I did find the picture from that first hackathon. So, you know, this is off the CoinDesk, but here's the picture, you know, at the mic. And this was one of the rooms, and there was, we had to co-opt another room. Like, this was very early in the process.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yep. Yep. I remember this one.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And here I am sitting in the middle of it over here. But yes. But, yeah, it grew really, really rapidly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alrighty. Close to rounding up here, but, got a couple more things. So things are moving along. 2016, there's some kinda organic momentum. I know, like, we hired a lot of people during this period of time. We're, you know, our software's been used in enterprise projects. We're kind of, like, ramping up headcounts because people are using our software more.

And so I'm looking at this, and, like, I can't believe that the time frame sort of were this tight. So DevCon two is September 2016. And so it's in Shanghai. Right?

So I do remember having to deal with all the visa stuff. The, you know, thankfully, dealt with that. We were kind of doing a capital raise, sort of our first sort of one at that time.

But it was, it felt like a coming out party. I don't know. I think what, do you guys recall? What are some of your impressions from DevCon two kind of etcetera?

**SPEAKER_02:**
There was some big attack on Ethereum. I'm trying to remember the details right now, but I remember, yeah. In the morning, and lots of stuff was happening on the business front there, but I remember, like, waking up and suddenly I was just, like, completely involved in, like, digging in with the Haskell client and figuring out what was going on and what changes we had to make.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So I do remember, it was, like, transactions that slowed the clients down being created. Right? And, yeah, I think, like, I guess it was, like, due to the way the data structures worked to some extent. It was, like, hard to make them process fast. I can't recall. But, yeah, it was funny that it was right around that time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Also okay. Sorry. Good. Well, the funny thing that I sort of remember is, like, and maybe you're about to talk about this, but the EEA was, sort of formed, during that conference.

And Victor somehow in the morning grabbed me, and he's like, I've got all these meetings, and, I'd like you to come along too. But I was like, I had my laptop, and I was, like, trying to dig into the tech with all the stuff that was going on there.

So I sort of sat in the corner in this coffee shop, and I was, like, programming all day. And then at the end of the day, I kinda was like, what were all those meetings you had? And Victor essentially is like, oh, yeah. We just formed the EEA.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, yeah. It was funny. I think, really, it was Jeremy Miller who I think later went on to become chief of staff at ConsenSys who really kind of drove that. Like, there had been a previous attempt, I think, by Matt Spoke to create some sort of group of enterprises to work together on standards, and that never kind of went anywhere.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But, I have no memory of this. So could you, did you know, Matt was at Deloitte.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Matt was at Deloitte a while. At the time. And Deloitte was early into blockchain. Like, so they were at DevCon one. They were really early into blockchain and kind of building up a practice, ironically, in the Toronto office. Right?

So, like, they're really focused on it, and so they were quite early and quite knowledgeable. And so they were trying to kind of, at some point, they had started this effectively a consortium of companies who want to use Ethereum. Right?

And then there was us where we were working with Microsoft that was hopping sort of organically. And but we realized that there was the need for companies to kind of collaborate to work together on this kind of stuff.

And Jeremy Miller just thought, like, this isn't working. Like, what's happening now isn't working. We gotta get some, you know, proper structure because I think it was just an announcement on the Ethereum Foundation site, but no one was really driving it.

So during that day, we, like, kind of aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop. Like, it was, like, literally happening beside you. And there was, like, Jeremy, you know, John Whelan was there from Santander, like, Spoke came in, I think Marley came in at one point, and, you know, well, like, James came in, and we were all kind of saying, okay, we need this organization, we need to get this together, and it was all happening at this coffee shop that was at the Starbucks that was just like just literally outside the conference center.

And it really kind of all came together, and it was amazing to me because it was, like, right, like, sort of by the end of the day, we were like, yes. We're gonna form this group that eventually became the EEA.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So I wanna add some peripheral details. So we get to Shanghai. Right? You get this, we're jet lagged. It's a hefty flight. You know? You get this card, and the card says something like aliens not going to hotels, aliens being, like, you know, people who are not Chinese who are in the country, must report to the police within seventy two hours or something.

And I was like, does that mean, like, the hotels are, like, part of the police? Like, I don't know. I assume plenty of listeners will not have been to Mainland China. And then you kinda get to the hotel.

So it's like, it was like an hour drive, remember the main airport is, to the hotel. Shanghai is vast. Like, there are high rises along the highway the whole way, and they just get denser as you get close to where we, do you know, is there a name for the neighborhood we were? We're staying in, like, the old stock exchange, I believe, which had been converted to a hotel. We were right downtown.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm trying to remember where we stayed at the time. The conference was right downtown along, I think, close to the Bund. That's the area next to the river.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And yeah. That's right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So the Bund is, like, the European side, and then the other side is, like, brand new. Yeah. That's Pudong. Like, that's, like, sort of, you know, originally was the suburbs, basically.

And, you know, like, I've founded two companies in China. So I think I was, like, the China expert there and, like, taking people around. And, yeah, like, I mean, you, well, if you're not staying in a hotel, the government wants to know how to reach you.

And so if you're, like, staying in an Airbnb and stuff, you need to, like, if you stay in a hotel, the hotel takes care of all that stuff for you, basically. They just, but, like, if you're staying in a hotel and we were all staying in sort of a small hotel.

But I remember, like, taking you guys for, like, a Chinese breakfast, and, like, you guys loved it. Like, we went back to that same place. Like, I was like, there are really good. I think we went to, like, a couple holes in the wall too.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So it was like this hole in the wall place, and I was just kind of trying to give you the flavor and you guys really liked it, so we kept on.

The other thing I remember about that conference is that the Wall Street Journal was there, and I remember I got quoted from them as saying, I think China is gonna be one of the biggest blockchain markets in the world. You know, and this is before they started their own digital currency and really kind of went in on creating their own blockchain.

But I remember people thought it was absolutely bonkers when I said that because they hadn't done anything. Like, it was, like, so early in the journey. But as you said, this all happened really fast.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I'd also mention so we announced a project we were working on and was getting close to completion with BHP Billiton. Yeah. So the big time project and kinda the first of our supply chain work.

Our kind of champion at BHP is a guy named Tyler Smith, very smart guy, geophysicist, blockchain enthusiast. And so the announcement was great. It definitely, got everyone excited about the technology, helped us close the financing at that time, etcetera.

So we're all on stage. But, also, I wanna mention that Tyler, I think he'd been to Shanghai before. And, you know, as one does when one's in Asia, you try to get some suits, you know, for lower cost. Right?

And he kinda told me, like, his algorithm. There's something nearby called, I believe, the fabric market. Is that very big?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And he, like, he sort of, like, hung out there for a little bit. He told me, and he watched where, like, the Chinese business people went. And they all went up to, like, the 3rd Floor to this particular guy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And so he kind of showed us where that was. I think you got some too. Right? Or I did. I did. And that algorithm worked out really well.

That is also my algorithm for finding good places to eat. Like, I follow taxi, like, the way I found that hole in the wall, like, you know, I lived in Beijing, so I've been to Shanghai plenty of times, but I didn't know near the hotel where they eat, and I just kind of follow where taxi drivers wind up stopping, and if that's the place, you know they probably have pretty good food there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Yeah. And he told me also the last time he had done a China trip, he went, like, ten hours by buses, trains, boats to get, like, the best silk blankets, which were somewhere near Shanghai. I was never able to look into this and get them back.

So, similarly, he kind of, you know, followed the, just the local knowledge will get you a long way, I guess.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, nowadays, it's all high speed rail. Like, I remember, like, I remember at various times traveling through China and being, like, you know, having, like, eighteen hour train rides and stuff like that, which were brutal. Because, like, in many times, I just had to stand during that entire time in a crowded thing.

But, yeah, now it's high speed rail. It's amazing. Like, it's faster than planes in most cases.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. In any case, it was an experience. Right? So we also, we, you know, we did some business development there, had a lot of meetings with prospective customers, investors, all that sort of thing.

It's definitely tough to do business in China. For listeners considering it and not from China, I don't recommend it unless you really know what you're doing. But it was quite the trip.

Like, I actually had to leave a little bit early for some events I was doing, I think, with Intel, actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But it was, you know, crazy. It made, you know, it made things, for a tech project, Ethereum was actually kinda Europe centric, but I think Asia, you know, almost bigger uptake there. So it made it feel really global.

And it was just kind of funny, you know, just to see all of this happening, you know, at the same time. Like, the Internet kinda works. You know? It was cool to hang out in Shanghai as well, and just totally different planet, felt like.

Alright. I think with that segue, we could probably wrap it up with the EEA leading up to the EEA launch.

So the idea had been hatched in a Starbucks in Shanghai. And basically, I kind of the quote, I guess, Jeremy was fond of saying is that, like, every innovation lab is using Ethereum now. They're watching us, and they're each hacking it their own way to be something they can actually use. Right?

So no one wanted to connect to the public net at that time. It's definitely changed some, you know, over the years, especially with the, you know, NFT revolution, etcetera.

And, you know, so there was not a lot of technological reuse going on in, you know, the duct tape that, you know, various enterprises were putting on the software to make it work for their needs.

Probably most notable in that, the set of enterprises was JPMorgan, which we can, you know, talk about in more detail. But a lot of them were doing it. The folks at the Innovation Lab at Santander, who we know pretty well, were doing their own thing. You know, it's quite interesting to observe the goings on.

And, Vic, do you remember okay. So there were, like, a couple face to face meetings that were, like, very hush-hush. I think Microsoft, some of them around the launch of the EEA. So you've kinda napkinned out the idea in Starbucks, but then what was the next thing that happened?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So then there were a bunch, there were a series of meetings that were kind of really about structuring. So, like, how did we wanna structure this organization and, you know, what composition should it be? Like, should it be all big companies? Should it be, you know, like, how much of the tech should be involved? How much of the, you know, company side should be involved, and how it should work.

Like, you know, should it be a free organization? Should we charge membership? Should, you know, and all of that was on the table.

But the amazing thing about those meetings is they did start small, but they eventually, like, wound up to be, like, 40 people in the room, like, all the major clients, you know, like, all of these things. Because I think at the time, really, where the interest was in terms of real world applications of the Ethereum blockchain was in the enterprise space. Like, they were willing to kinda make investments into that.

So, like, everyone was kinda participating into that. And so there were, like, these, like, really, really active discussions. And, ultimately, we just kind of had to set a line in the sand and make a launch, basically.

And that kind of led to it launching in sort of early 2017. But, you know, in terms of time frame, you gotta think that, like, it was only a little over a year when we launched with a single big company.

And then at the launch of EEA, it was, like, 40 companies that were...

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I remember 28 or something like that. There was a logo wall that was nice they showed. You know? It was really substantial.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And it was in the Brooklyn JPM office and, you know, like, it was, like, a lot of big players, and this really kind of told the world, like, hey. This is serious. Like, this is something that should happen.

So, you know, it was really, really exciting, but, yeah, the negotiations around it were really complicated, and in some cases, he did. I remember, like, one of the biggest negotiations was between the different clients. Right? Like, there was us, and then there were other clients who were trying to figure out, like, how do we share information between us?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I'd also add okay. So JPMorgan, when did they announce Quorum?

**SPEAKER_01:**
That's a good question. I don't, I think it was, probably before the EEA launch, but I'm not sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. I know they were, I know they had a blockchain team that ironically also were working in Haskell. So they were, and, you know, eventually, we wound up doing work on Quorum too. So there was like, we've been talking to them a while, and but I can't remember when the official launch of Quorum was.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I have some memory that they demoed something at...

**SPEAKER_00:**
And ConsenSys might have helped, like, the front end of the demo. I can't quite recall, but I believe that they demoed something at the launch, which was what? Like, it's sort of February or March 2017?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Something like that. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So I think they must have announced it by then. So Quorum is, was, a flavor of Ethereum or a flavor of enterprise Ethereum where they take the Go Ethereum client and done things like add privacy and so that it was easier to obscure data, and there was, like, a messaging layer it had, you know, etcetera.

And, yes, similar things we developed over the years, just as we in response to the, you know, privacy preferences and needs of big enterprises, basically. So they all wanted to use the technology, didn't want a native token. They didn't want too much detail leaking to, you know, potentially competitors or even just trading counterparties, etcetera.

So they, you know, a lot of people at the same time developed kinda similar features to service, you know, the enterprise need.

The, but yeah. So the event, 30 big enterprises, there, you know, or 30 companies, a few startups, a lot of big enterprises. I think the membership of the EEA peaked at, like, 500 companies or something really large. Right? Like, big in the hundreds. Like, I don't remember. 100 or something like that.

So, like, on the back of this announcement, the business side, you know, got pretty excited. And, you know, later in that year, there's also crypto run ups. Kind of everyone wanted to be involved.

But I think of the EEA launch as sort of the end of the beginning. If you look back at the price trend also, oh, I'm bringing it back up and closed it.

So let's say it's February here. It does start to really tick up and hit into kind of a fever pitch 2017, 2018. Right? So, yeah. You know, it's already at this time, you know, around $10, but, you know, it really goes dramatically up, and then it, you know, kind of the next phase is the heyday of the ICO era, which we probably won't talk about today.

But in my mind, that was when it was a new but established platform and technology, Ethereum, kind of generally acknowledged by some of the public, but big businesses as well, and had sort of transitioned. It was almost in the position of incumbent at that point.

Now I also, I don't quite recall, like, what, you know, maybe if I flip this to market cap, like, when did Ethereum, you know, move up the ranks? You know, it'd be good to know the, like, what was the big ranks crypto coins or however you wanna call them at that time.

Like, for a while, Litecoin was number two. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. And I think Ripple was up there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
He was usually three or something. And, you know, I don't even know where Litecoin is today, but I have to check when the actual crossover happened. Ethereum would be solidly number two for a long time.

But maybe we should, you know, maybe I'll figure that out right now? I forget how to overlay the prices on CoinMarketCap or the market caps rather.

So we've never seen the flip just yet, but it got close at different times in this journey. So, anyway, I think we could probably leave it there slightly shorter than the last episode, it appears.

But I don't know. Any final words, Vic, Jim, from, you know, this interesting time period in many people's lives, our lives?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think it was just, like, you know, looking back, it seems that, you know, I think if you look back on successful projects, there's sort of that survivorship bias that, you know, all the elements were just there. And you can see a lot of the elements there, but I don't think in any way that success was predetermined. Like, I think there was a lot of coordinated effort. Right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
A lot of effort. On it together. Yeah. Getting the pieces to make it happen, so to speak.

I mean, it's dangerous to look back in time and say, like, I knew that was gonna happen, but I will say that even before the launch, I remember feeling that I'd never seen such a large group of people so excited about a particular project as that one.

So, yeah. It felt like it was gonna be successful. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I just mean that, you know, we've mentioned a bunch of the people that, like, I think they all contributed to the success of the key point even though they weren't, you know, the founders of Ethereum. Like, they made something happen that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. It's an interesting thing. It's like, are you being tossed in a great wave, or can you will reality into existence? And it's like, I tend to think of it as a little bit of both. Right? I mean, it's not all hot air from us because we literally, we do. We did some of it. Lives. We made it successful technology.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Anyways, alright. Let's close it there. Thanks, everybody, for listening this far, if you make it this far on the second one. And, yeah, it'd be interesting to, you know, we might continue this series. We could also kinda delve in on any particular part of it. Maybe we'll get a guest. Maybe we'll do something.

So if anyone wants us to cover anything particular, please do let us know.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Thank you.
