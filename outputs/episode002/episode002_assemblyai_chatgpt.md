**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] All right, well, welcome back, everybody.
[00:03] The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter.
[00:09] I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video.
[00:14] And there have been a few people who reached out, who we've known a long time, who really appreciated the content.
[00:19] One of them called it, you know, essential viewing.
[00:22] So anyway, we're back for another episode.
[00:25] So remind everybody, I'm KIERAN James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders.
[00:30] Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:33] Oh, okay.
[00:34] I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:38] I'm James Hermos DIA, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:42] All right, thank you.
[00:44] And so I believe where we left—
[00:46] So I can't watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch.
[00:53] And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity.
[01:01] So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:08] Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building—
[01:12] You know, what in those days were known as dapps.
[01:15] I guess some people still call it that, but that seems to have gone out of favor with "blockchain applications."
[01:20] So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum.
[01:25] And that was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small co-working space in Greenpoint.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:31] I think it was on Water Street.
[01:33] It was called Green Desks, maybe Green Ducks?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:35] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:36] Yeah, it's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:40] Exactly.
[01:41] Yeah, that's right.
[01:42] And of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time.
[01:45] In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise.
[01:48] I looked up one day and there was like a big, kind of well-manicured park there.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:52] Yeah, well, they kind of walled it off and so it just was like—
[01:55] I don't know, I thought it was like an abandoned site.
[01:57] And then one day all of a sudden the wall was gone and there was a beautiful—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:00] So at that event, which was I think two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum—
[02:05] I will say the concepts were really interesting.
[02:08] People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer.
[02:13] And ConsenSys at this point was only like maybe 20 people at max.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:17] 20 or 30.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:18] Yeah, it was really, really small.
[02:20] And some great concepts came up.
[02:22] But even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time.
[02:28] Like, it was just impossible.
[02:30] Very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible.
[02:34] Like, you could read the state off the blockchain, all this kind of stuff.
[02:37] So that kind of led into—
[02:39] Yeah, everything building in those days was incredibly hard.
[02:42] And that led into—
[02:43] So we decided at that event we were going to, at the launch of Ethereum, do a bigger hackathon.
[02:48] And that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which kind of coincided with the launch of Ethereum.
[02:53] And it was us, the Java client, which I think was called EtherCamp at that time, and other tools that were kind of combined together.
[03:00] But what was really interesting about that one was it was bigger.
[03:03] I think the first one we had like six participants.
[03:06] The other one we had, I think, close to 30.
[03:09] But it introduced a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly.
[03:13] Like, the winner was a GameFi app.
[03:15] It really had that element of tokenized gameplay.
[03:18] There was a decentralized social app, I think called Truther or something like that.
[03:23] And then there was a traceability supply chain app in those early days.
[03:27] And that kind of all coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:31] Yeah.
[03:32] So you're talking about the second one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:34] I'm talking about the second one.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:35] Yeah, the second one.
[03:36] Also, the offices had shifted.
[03:38] So ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick.
[03:44] I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote.
[03:48] I remember there was like a horse lineage app.
[03:51] Yeah, pretty interesting.
[03:52] And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon.
[03:57] But that one was open to externals, right?
[03:59] So that was the big difference.
[04:01] And it actually was quite well attended.
[04:03] The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall.
[04:08] And do you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days?
[04:11] I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:13] I think it was two days.
[04:14] And yeah, like the air conditioning thing—
[04:16] So we moved into that space to have the hackathon.
[04:19] ConsenSys was planning because they had outgrown that co-working space already.
[04:23] And so we moved into that space, which was a reasonably sized room.
[04:27] You could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room.
[04:30] But yes, the air conditioning was terrible and we had to frantically—
[04:34] We only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to frantically buy some and set them up.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:39] Okay, I do have a memory of that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:41] Yeah, I don't know if you recall that, but yeah, we were trying to get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up because we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:50] These were the scrappy days.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:52] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:53] Manually configuring air conditioning.
[04:55] I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for where you are in your startup journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:00] There was a lot of furniture.
[05:01] I mean, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there.
[05:04] And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started to get everything running.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:08] And was this to sort of commemorate the launch, I think?
[05:11] Or was it like right before the launch?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:13] It was right—
[05:14] Actually, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be.
[05:17] The dates were always shifting.
[05:19] And we just said—
[05:20] We kind of arbitrarily chose—
[05:22] We wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was—
[05:27] And even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague.
[05:30] We were like, is that going to actually happen?
[05:32] So we kind of at some point had to arbitrarily choose the date.
[05:35] And they more or less—
[05:36] It was the right date.
[05:37] I think it was off by maybe a day or two.
