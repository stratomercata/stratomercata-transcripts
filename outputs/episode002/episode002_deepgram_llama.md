Here is the corrected transcript:**


**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Alright. Well, welcome back, everybody. The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for our first video. And there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So, anyway, we're back for another episode. So remind everybody, I'm Kieran James, CEO of BlockApps, here with my cofounders. Victor, do you wanna introduce yourself quickly?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, cofounder and chief product officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:02] I'm James from... Jim, CTO and founder, cofounder of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:03] Alright. Thank you. And so I believe where we left, so I can't watch video of myself. So I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch. And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kinda backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kinda after launch activity. So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first consensus dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe. Yeah. So

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:04] that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building, you know, what in those days were known as dapps. I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go now in favor with blockchain applications. So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum. And that was in the first Consensus office, which was like a very small coworking space in, like, Greenpoint, I think. I'm gonna say it was water

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:05] Heard. It was called Green Desks, maybe?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:06] Green Desks. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:07] So at that event, you know, which was, I think, two months to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I I will say not the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys at this point was only, like, maybe 20 people at max. Like, was really, really small. And, you know, some great concepts came up, but, like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. Like, it was just impossible. Like, very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. Like, you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, all of this kind of stuff. So that kind of led into, yeah, like, everything building in those states were incredibly hard. And that led into, so we decided at that event, we were gonna do a bigger hackathon, and that became the second Consensus dappathon, which had coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:08] Yeah. So okay. In this, so you're talking about the second one? I'm talking about the second one. Yeah. The second one, also, the offices had shifted. So, yeah, we had, or Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is I I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote. I remember there was, like, a horse lineage app. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty interesting. You know? And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was open to externals. Right? So that was the big difference. And it actually was, you know, quite well attended. The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall. And you, you think that one was, like, twenty-four hours, or it was two days? I can't remember. It was two days. And, yeah, like, the air conditioning thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:09] So at that, so at that event, you know, which was, I think, two months to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I I will say not the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys at this point was only, like, maybe 20 people at max. Like, was really, really small. And, you know, some great concepts came up, but, like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. Like, it was just impossible. Like, very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. Like, you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, all of this kind of stuff. So that kind of led into, yeah, like, everything building in those states were incredibly hard. And that led into, so we decided at that event, we were gonna do a bigger hackathon, and that became the second Consensus dappathon, which had coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:10] These were the scrappy days. Yeah. Manually configuring air condition. I think the amount of, like, furniture assembly that you do is, like, a good proxy for how crappy you are in your startup journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:11] There was a lot of furniture. I mean, we, we kept like, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there. And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, so we had to get get everything up and running. And it was this to, like, sort of commemorate the launch,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:12] I think, or was it, like, right before the launch? It was it was it was right

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:13] it actually, you know, if if you recall at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be. Like, the the dates were always shifting. Right? And we just said, we can't arbitrarily chose like, we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because it was because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was. And even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague. Like, we're like, is that gonna actually happen? So we we kind of, at some point, had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they they more or less was the right date. Like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:14] Yeah. So okay. In this, so so you're talking about the second one? I'm talking about the second one. Yeah. The second one, also, the offices had shifted. So, yeah, we had, or Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is I I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote.
