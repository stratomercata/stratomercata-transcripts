**SPEAKER_00:**
Alright.
Well, welcome back, everybody.
The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter.
I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now,
which I think is
not so bad for our first video.
And there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content.
One of them called it, you know,
essential
viewing.
So,
anyway, we're back for another episode.
So remind everybody, I'm Kieran James, CEO of block apps, here with my cofounders.
Victor, do you wanna introduce yourself quickly?
Oh, okay.
I'm Victor Wong,
cofounder and
chief product officer of BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_01:**
co-founder and
CTO and founder,
Kieran, of block apps.
Alright.
Thank you.
And so I believe where we left off, so I can't watch
video of myself,
so I forget exactly
how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch.
And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kinda
backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kinda after launch activity.
So with that said,
maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first
consensus dappathon,
which was June 2015, I believe.
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
That was,
I think, the first actual
hackathon building,
you know,
what
what we what in those days were known as dapps.
I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go now in favor with blockchain applications.
So the first idea was to really try to build
blockchain applications
directly on Ethereum.
And
that was in the first consensus office, which was like a very small coworking space in,
I think, Greenpoint, I'm gonna say it was water
in Yeah.
He heard.
It was called Green Desks, maybe?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Green Desks.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
So it's right next to the modern day Domino Park,
maybe a block away from there.
So Exactly.
Yeah.
That's right.
So and it it of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time.
In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise.
I'd, like, looked up one day,
and there was, like, a big kind of well manicured park there.
Yeah.
They kind of walled it off,
and so it just was like I
thought it was, like, an abandoned site.
And then one day, all of sudden, the wall was gone,
and there was a beautiful park there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So at that so at that
event,
you know, which was, I think, two months to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum,
I I will say not the concepts were really interesting.
People were coming up,
and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer.
And ConsenSys at this point was only, like, maybe
20 people at max.
Like, was really,
really small.
And,
you know, some great concepts came up,
but, like, even with the stuff we built,
we realized pretty quickly that
no one could build anything in a short period of time.
Like, it was just impossible.
Like,
very basic stuff, like reading
a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible.
Like, you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, all of this kind of stuff.
So that kind of led into
yeah.
Like,
everything building in those states were incredibly hard.
And that led into
so we decided at that event, we were gonna
at the launch of Ethereum, we were gonna do a bigger hackathon,
and
that became the second consensus dappathon, which had coincided
with the launch of Ethereum.
And it was us,
you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ethercap at that time,
and,
like, other tools that were kind of combined together.
But what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger.
Like, I think the first one, we had, like, six participants.
The other one, we had, like, I think close to 30.
And
but it introduced,
like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly.
Like,
the winner was a GameFi app.
Like, it really had that that element of tokenized gameplay.
There was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther or
something some something like that.
And then there was, like, a traceability supply chain app in those early days,
and that kind of all coincided
with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
So okay.
In this so so you're talking about the second one?
I'm talking about the second one.
Yeah.
The second one, also, the offices had shifted.
So Yep.
We had
or consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time,
had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick,
which is
I I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone
mostly remote.
I remember there was, like, a there's, like, a horse lineage app.
Yeah.
Pretty interesting.
You know?
And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in in the hackathon,
but that one was open to externals.
Right?
So that was the big difference.
And it actually was, you know, quite well attended.
The room,
I think, never had the greatest air conditioning,
but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall.
And you you think that one was, like, twenty four hours, or it was two days?
I can't remember.
It was two days.
And, yeah,
the air conditioning thing.
So we moved into that space

**SPEAKER_01:**
to have the hackathon.
Like, you know, consensus was blank because they had outgrown that coworking space already.
And so we moved into that space,
which can yeah.
It was a reasonably sized room.
Like, you could probably get 80 to a 100 people in that room.
Right?
But, yes,
the air conditioning was terrible,
and we had to frantically
we only realized this after we got into the room,
so we had to, like, frantically buy some and set them up.
Okay.
I do have a memory of that.
I don't know if you recall that,
but, yeah, we were, like, trying to, like, get those air conditioning units in place before, like, a ton of people showed up.
Because, yeah,
like, we were sweating when there were only, like, five people in the room.

**SPEAKER_00:**
These were the scrappy days.
Yeah.
Manually configuring air condition.
I think the amount of, like,
furniture assembly that you do is, like, a good proxy for how crappy you are in in your startup journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There was a lot of furniture.
I mean, we we kept like,
it was basically an empty room when we moved in there.
And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started,
so we had to get get everything up and running.
And it was this to, like,
sort of commemorate the launch,

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think or was it, like, right before the launch?
It was it was it was right

**SPEAKER_01:**
it actually,
if if you recall at the time,
we didn't know when the launch would be.
Like, the the dates were always shifting.
Right?
And we just said, we can't arbitrarily chose like,
we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch,
but because it was because we couldn't
know exactly when the launch was.
And even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague.
Like, we're like,
is that gonna actually happen?
So we we kind of, at some point,
had to arbitrarily choose the date,
and they they more or less was
the right date.
Like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Jim,
I might have asked you this last episode,
but I'll ask again.
Do you remember,
one, trying to predict the launch,
and could you explain how?
And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen because it's hard for, like, a decentralized group to decide on a launch time.
I can't remember that at all.
You were mentioning it in the last video,
and I I didn't remember this,
but I I don't doubt it.
It sounds correct.
I am.
You were saying we were looking through the the Git commits at the time.
We were.
Yes.
You know, you made this plot.
It was, like,
commits by day,
and I was, like, the commits and you,
like, extrapolated it for it.
I think probably got within a couple days of of the launch date.
But
okay.
So
I have to yeah.
I still don't know how they, like,
set the clock on the first block, so to speak.
Maybe we can, like, dig this up.
There was something they did,

**SPEAKER_02:**
and that we had It's probably in our DMs.
I I I wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had.
Maybe the graph is in there.
Yeah.
That's very funny.
The Slack is a treasure trove of
Interesting things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Alright.
So yeah.
So it launched,
and I kinda felt like there was a sort of
and then what's going on?
You know?
It took a little time for things to get going.
And then, you know,
this it
obviously, it's just been a smashing success.
Right?
It's just sort of the the reality of a new platform.
You sort of get it out there.
You see what people do.
You learn from it.
And, you know,
it took a minute for

**SPEAKER_02:**
the activity to kick in.
Jim,
there's remember, like
a lot of people around us at the time had had been buying a lot of presale
ether be beforehand.
And so the day it came out,
I think they were expecting it to, like, have a huge jump in value immediately.
And when when, like, you know,
a couple weeks had gone by and it was only
still, like, 20¢ in ether or so,
remember people around us were kinda like some of the people there were like, oh, this thing was a flop.
It's never gonna go anywhere.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
I mean,
it's just psychologically yeah.
The expectations were super high.
There was this concept floating around consensus of day one dapps.
Like, you had to be ready
right for the launch because,
you know, it was a land grab and things were going to the moon.
And, you know,
it turned out to, you know,
not quite be
obviously, again, smashing success.
But, yeah,
the price is, like, under a dollar for a little bit,
and then around a dollar for, like, a while,
I believe.
And I did wanna mention so
I I had to look this up.
So the first
ICO, whatever you wanna call it,
that was on Ethereum obviously, Ethereum did its own crowdsale,
but it was like you know,
they took in Bitcoin,
and there was was something like 2,000 ether to 1 Bitcoin at the time,
which I believe at the time was, like, 20 or 30¢,
and then it had gone up to a dollar on launch.
It's already a pretty good return.
You know?
But
that is what it is.
The first ICO apparently was Augur.
And I I knew the Augur guys a little bit.
I was digging through the Crypto Economicon videos.
I believe one or two of them presented
or run panels at at Crypto Economicon
For folks who are
listening to this,
Crypto Economicon was a conference that we had
in January
2015
that involved
a lot of the people who then, including Vitalik and some of the other Ethereum folks,
subsequently created really big and interesting, mostly layer one projects in the Ethereum space, but others as well.
So the videos are actually up.
I I tweeted a couple of them,
but there was a apparently, I think I created a YouTube channel, like, in 2015
and uploaded all those.
I definitely remember getting them recorded.
So check those out if that's of interest.
So Augur was
the first, I guess,
of the prediction markets platforms.
They've there's there since have been a couple of new ones that have popped up that seem to be popular.
There was also this sort of competing project called truth coin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I was kind of confused about how the two related to each other.
I think there was no formal relation, though.
I remember meeting up.
This guy named Matt Liston I met who I I checked his LinkedIn.
He's he's been in a different couple different places.
So I think Auger maybe we should look up who actually founded Augur.
So Jeremy Gardner, I, you know, I've known over the years.
And he I met him in San Francisco
with Vitalik
because Vitalik was staying at what was termed at the time the Crypto Castle.
And, you know,
it's kind of what you would imagine,
sort of like a coworking, colliving
crypto space for and and not everyone there was working on Augur.
They're all working on different things and kind of common

**SPEAKER_01:**
thing to do.
Well, I I think if you hear the term crypto castle now,
people would imagine an actual castle.
It's a
you know, what you're describing, which is more like a dormitory.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It it yes.
It was more like a dorm.
I mean,
it was nice nice little house.
I do I can't remember.
It might have been, like, adjacent to the Mission in in San Francisco.
And
so Vitalik would stay there sometimes.
Joey Krug, we have probably met two or three times over the years.
I'm not even sure if I ever met Jack Peterson.
So those are the three founders of Augur.
I guess they had you know,
they were good friends with the telekin or just sort of had realized early on that it would be easier to develop on Ethereum,
than it would be to try to do something with Bitcoin, which was
kind of the predominant suggestion
at the time.
But they did the first
on Ethereum
crowdfunding,
like, I guess right after launch.
The Wikipedia is saying August 2015,
which is
really,
really early.
I don't know if I believe this Wikipedia page.
It says, soon after the platform launched, users had created the death pools or assassination markets on famous people.
So back in 2015,
every discussion
about blockchain
eventually led both to prediction markets and then this sort of uncensor ability, you can't shut it down, would lead then to assassination
markets.
Assassination markets
being you predict
you bet on the day someone dies.
You know?
And then
someone takes the other side of that bed,
kills them, and collects on it.
So, apparently, there actually were
assassination markets created on Ethereum.
According to this Wikipedia page, I'm a yeah.
I have to look into that.
I'm a little bit dubious.
But in any case,
I guess, Ethereum then blazed the trail sort of after Ethereum did with its successful crowdsale
for the wave of ICOs that that came later.
But yeah.
So so Truthcoin was also this competing project.
I just remember meeting up with Matt at, like, a Berkeley coffee shop and talking about both
Augur and Truthcoin had some sort of,
you know, machine learning, slightly, like, computer science graph theoretic way of, like, determining what the truth was.
So, like, you take a bunch of votes from a bunch of people,
but then determine the principal components of how the voting is then extract the truth from there.
So it sounded like very, you know, high end math mechanistic,
which it was very common of the space.
Ever ever
like,
you know, the crypto has a lot of these, like and I I was in the math department in Berkeley.
A lot of these, like, mathematician types who, like, kinda came in and wanted to create, like, really complicated
schemes and mechanisms and all that sort of stuff, that had provable theoretical properties for something interesting about,
you know, this this base.
But yeah.
I'm so so they must have launched it, like, right away.
That's very interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Remember us talking to them at some point,
and they were developing that.
Like, they did want to be a day one dapp, I remember.
And they were
the first went live 2018, the Wikipedia page says,
but they did the crowdsale, like, basically right away.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So should we go on to DevCon one?
Which I guess I can talk about.
So
kinda concurrently while all this is happening, we started to work a bunch.
So consensus had a
business development team,
little bit bit of a mix of
marketing BD,
actual sales, you know, etcetera,
that
was
starting to generate interest from big companies in the technology.
So,
you know, for us ourselves, we definitely worked with companies far more than sort of the crypto public for, you know, most of the history of the company.
Still don't really work with the crypto public today.
But,
you know, consensus was kind of conflicted on this front.
So they
you know, while they they had sort of pure blockchain native project in in eventually in big numbers,
they also had an enterprise arm, which is really more consulting oriented.
Although they kind of ended up sort of backfilling
what they saw demand for with products at times.
But in any case,
the the BD folks were reaching out to everybody, and they actually got a fair bit of interest,
from Microsoft.
And
I think Microsoft had already been kinda watching the Ethereum revolution and, you know, seeing it as something interesting,
you know, the new front of the cloud war perhaps.
And so, you know, we
got to working with them.
And,
actually, maybe for the technical part of this, I could kinda transition .
But, basically so consensus had a couple,
you know,
preferred projects which had the low level,
you know, like, the blockchain
client itself, infrastructure that could be deployed on cloud platforms.
And maybe yeah.
So
that ended up being
basically us and the, you know, the the Java folks.
Victor, do you wanna, you know, take any I I think you were saying before Yeah.
Sure.

**SPEAKER_01:**
they
so they were interested in kind of being able to deploy
a
one of the clients
that we had, you know, we had the Haskell client and then the Java folks.
They were actually more interested in the Java folks.
Wait.
I should take a step back here.
Just mentioning that DevCon one almost didn't happen if you recall.
Right?
Because
it was in this low period, and the Ethereum Foundation was kind of running out of money because,
you know, this is why the launch had to happen when it happened.
And
in that low period, they were, like, still trying to preserve a lot of cash.
And so
it almost didn't happen.
And I remember, like, a lot of people inside consensus were like, no.
Like, we have to, like, bring this to kind of bring this up and make an event out of this.
You know?
Like, I think Andrew Keyes was leading the charge in that, really saying, like, we got to do this.
And then this Microsoft thing kind of bundled
into that.
Right?
So
it was us
and the Java client.
And my background was, like, you know,
in my previous company, I had tried to work with Microsoft in building apps, like, when they had their first mobile platform,
and it took me, like, six months to get a meeting, and I had a cousin who was, like, a VP at Microsoft.
So it was really so it was amazing to me that they were just coming to us, and they wanted to launch something with us in two months .
And I think at that point,
we, like, we, like, decided, okay.
This is a huge opportunity.
We're gonna drop everything and focus on that launch, which turned out to be the launch of blockchain as a service .
And
but oddly enough,
the Java guys started, and then they just kind of faded away.
Like, they they weren't really interested
in kind of pursuing it.
They just had other things going on .
So we we, like, went over it.
So by the time DevCon one happened,
the only thing that was working was, you know, our client on it was ready on the cloud .
You could download it, and you could start building on it right away.
And then remember, like, we we started to get, like, downloads immediately.
People started to get, you know, people using it immediately.
But that's also in that run up,
that was, like, when kind of we realized or Microsoft realized, like, if we're gonna make this as a developer tool,
it can't, you know, neck to the public Ethereum network
because people wouldn't be able to get ether.
Like, it was quite hard to get ether at that point.
There weren't really that many exchanges or anything to go on .
So we were that's kind of how we kind of created,
like, private Ethereum,
you know, and private enterprise.
What what became known as private Ethereum or enterprise Ethereum .
So that that kind of all led up .
And then the launch itself
in London,
when we got up with Microsoft, I think people were shocked that Microsoft was into it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
You know, so I
just looked that up and and didn't have in our little outline,
but I I had forgotten about this.
So I think Coinbase listed
ether, like, mid twenty sixteen.
Right?
It I'm seeing 05/24/2016.
So
and I I guess, like,
Kraken was the popular exchange at the time .
You know?
I think it was Poloniacs.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
Yeah.
Poloniacs still exist.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And and I just remember there was, like,
the chat function on Poloniacs.
It's like, man .
Like, that was, like, crazy .
Like, that was, like, Discord before there was Discord.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Oh, wait.
Hold on.
Circle
bought it maybe,
and then it seems to have shut it down .
Anyway, I'm I'm confused by all this.
But So it was, like, it was sketchy for sure.
It was like a whale chat box .
I never really used it,
but I would, like, see it on people's computers
and all that sort of thing .
It was it
was difficult to get in and out of ether for a while.
Jim,
are you gonna say something?

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm just kind
of remembering back then .
Remind remind me because I'm I'm sort of, like,
not sure if I've got this right, but I sort of I think maybe you're you're downplaying the Java thing a little bit.
I think if I remember right,

**SPEAKER_01:**
Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time .
Am am I misremembering that?
No.
You're not.
They they they well, the thing is they really want something that they could
pitch to companies.
And, you know,
just you know, companies use Java .
Right?
So they were, like, really
and
so, like, when we kind of, like,
were, like like, we just dropped everything and just focused on that .
And I remember, like, we sort of had the internal mantra, like, we gotta get on stage and be able to write a dapp in, like, thirty seconds.
Like, that was our internal magic .
They had, like, preannounced something or something,
and and and then the Java guys sort of disappeared or or something, if ever .
They preannounced that, you know, they were gonna show, like, the Java client and the Haskell client, and we were like this we were like the runner-up.
Like, they were like I think they kind of
accepted us because we were willing to work really hard,
and the Java got like, I think they knew that they needed a backup.

**SPEAKER_02:**
The other thing I I remember about Microsoft is that there was a little bit of, like, tension
within there because there were the they were just launching Azure at that time.
Yeah.
And at the same time, they had blockchain people .
And the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it,
and the Azure people wanted to, like, use this as a way to to promote
the new platform.
So so there was always a little bit of friction within.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, like,
I remember, like
I think they're you know, Marley Gray was really driving those efforts inside Microsoft at the time and
they all were teether .
Like, they were, like, really, really pushing it.
And I I remember, like,
they were trying to get people in the room to talk to us,
and some of them wouldn't even go in the room.
Like,
I I mean, it was probably like you said, they were launching Azure,
so that's a huge project .
I'm sure they were just busy with other stuff,
but we spent a lot of time in their New York office.
I remember we were, like, going there all the time.
Yeah.
I'm seeing the Azure launches 2010.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I I checked it,
but it did feel much more nascent than it is today .
Like, Amazon got out.
AWS got out there and, like, took the whole market,
and then Azure was kind of, like, in a catch up mode .
But I think it might have even, like, exceeded AWS revenues at some point.
Running around

**SPEAKER_01:**
one of the conferences,
I can't remember which one,
handing out free passes to your to everybody .
It was that conference.
DEF CON won.
Okay.
Yeah.
They were they were handing it out,
and that's why they wanted to make sure we were on their marketplace .
So, like, they could hand out this free pass,
and you could get the,
you know, you could get our
client up and running and start building something right away.
And that was, like, a revelation to a lot of people .
I remember, like, dozens of companies were,
like, starting

**SPEAKER_02:**
in that first week.
Their devious plan worked on us.
They we grabbed a whole bunch of free passes,
and then a year later, we were, like, giving them, like, $10,000
a month to to stay on.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It it it definitely works.
Oh, I get you.
Yeah.
But I don't know if you remember,
like, the the day after the Microsoft announcement,
there was a spike in the price,
and we were like,
I think we just did that.
The
price, you mean the Microsoft stock price?
No.
No.
No.
I meant the The enterprise .
Ethereum price.
I think it was both, actually.
Yeah.
I think Memory of the Microsoft stock price,
like, slightly ticking.
Yeah.
I think they both went up,
and we were like, hey .
I think we actually did that.
But so, like, either went from 20¢ to 30¢?
No.
I think it I think it actually went significantly
up .
I I remember,
like, it was I think it might have, like, doubled for a day or something like that.
20¢ to 40¢?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Maybe, I think it was like a dollar to a dollar 80 or I I don't remember the price.
Yeah.
Oh, check it out.
It's hard to see.
It's funny the price range is like so.
Yes,
because the price is low.
Okay, so it's interesting.
Right?
So so DEFCON's, like, December.
Right?
Yeah.
Something like that.
It's around a dollar.
Yeah.
There it is.
New area starts taking up.
Like Yeah.
And I think we definitely got calls related to the Microsoft announcement into January.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So we probably had something to do with it.
I yeah.
You never know what really was causing price action.
But

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm
I'm joking, but I just remember,
like,
the mentality within
was that until it was
up to $20,
people thought it was a a flop.
And somehow when it hit $20, everybody around me all of a sudden got really excited then.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yep.
The average person,
you know, buys high, sells low.
So yeah.
That's that's
pretty successful at 20, and it was still low.
Okay.
So moving along,
kind of on the back of the enterprise announcement
sorry.
The Microsoft announcement, we started to get customers.
And a lot of it was, like, enterprises that were fairly early in their journey
and,
you know, wanted just some advice on on blockchain technology.
Some of them were actually ready to implement something .
I don't Vic.
You took a whole lot of phone calls.
You know?
Oh, man.
Yeah.
You know?
Do you wanna comment on on any of that?
I mean,
it was kind of amazing.
Like

**SPEAKER_01:**
like,
now the numbers in relative size seem pretty small .
But in the first couple months, we went from
zero to, like, dozens of companies calling us.
Right?
And and and
the amazing thing to me was they had actually tried our software .
Like, they had played around.
And, like, I remember over and over,
people were like, oh, you know, like, we've been working on blockchain project for the last two years and haven't been able to build anything, and now we can do something .
Right?
So I remember, like,
we were getting them from financial companies and, like,
you know,
resource company and mining companies,
and, like, it was, like, all across the spectrum of people trying things .
Because I don't think they really knew what they wanted to do, but they wanted an easy way to get in, and for the first time, they had it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Gotcha.
Do you remember
so I believe
I'm trying to keep this straight.
So
I remember the the project Slockit
was sort of being marketed at DevCon one,
but I believe it's a lot of the same people as the DAO .
And do you remember like, I think they used it, but I can't I'm I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.
So Socket was this sort of IoT kind of strange thing that you could unlock a lock,

**SPEAKER_01:**
but they
it was structured around
what actually became the DAO .
Like, they I think they invented the concept not the concept,
but I think they practically created a DAO in order to their own this lock .
And then they realized, well, you know,
I I think they realized, well, we don't actually need the lock.
Like, the DAO is the most important thing, and the lock, the actual lock thing is not that interesting.
So, yeah, it was
100%
the same people.
Like, they were introducing both ideas at the same time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So let me let me transition into the DAO part.
I'm gonna go slightly out of order here.
So,
Victor, what was the DAO?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So the DAO was basically
it was kind of like a
investment fund on
the Ethereum blockchain.
Right?
So, basically,
people
would
put,
like, money into this contract,
and this contract would basically fund.
The the goal of it was it would fund different projects.
But it started to, like, consume a huge amount of,
you know, the overall ether supply .
I think it was as high as, like, 20 or 25% of the entire ether supply got locked up into this contract.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
I'm looking on the Wikipedia right now.
So the part of the the reason I thought of it in this the sequence is, like, looking at the price action.
Part of it is that the supply
the extent ether supply
went down
because
oh, okay.
So as of May 2016, the DAO had attracted nearly 14%
of all ether tokens issued to date .
So they ran a crowdsale,
and crowdsale
raised
$34,000,000.
34,000,000 by 05/10/2016.
More than 50 by May 12,
over a 100 by May 15 .
So sometimes the the
the dynamics of these ICOs this this is one thing one, it's kinda crazy.
But, like,
one thing that blockchain seem to do that are it's really difficult to do with other technologies is to have this sort of
really large scale collaboration,
and and in this case, to pool capital,
basically.
Yep.
So
I suppose the there was a some sort of virality
going on.
People are talking about the DAO, and you just see this, like, enormous movement of funds
sort of overnight.
And
you know?
So
okay.
By they they end up holding by 05/21/2016
over a $150,000,000
in ether from over 10,000 people,
which is about
it it it says, according to the article, about 14% of all ether tokens issued at that time.
Yeah.
Okay.
So so
it it was really fast.
Right?
Like,
it it took everybody a surprise .
I remember I think I had a a meeting that the the the enterprise folks at consensus had set up with, I'm say, the people at BBVA.
I'm forgetting last names, but I think it was was, like, Scarlet and Carlos .
I don't think you went to this one, Vic.
I think you were in town.
But
they were just like it it just caught everyone's attention.
It was crazy .
You know?
And they were we were talking a bit about, like, operational use cases for the bank.
But then there was also, like, the you know, the there was a sense that, like, this is where the future is .
Like, the money just moved.
You know?
Like, you you there were no
really
you know, there's heavy subscription agreements and, you know, all that sort of thing .
And,
you know, it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years.
Yeah.
So by
by June,
the
people discovered that you could
exploit the DAO to siphon off the funds.
Yeah.
Do you know anything about that beyond
you know, it was crazy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So so there were so you had all the supply locked into this contract,
and I think the hack was,
like yeah.
So there was this massive race between
there was a flaw in the contract logic, and because it's immutable, the smart contract couldn't be changed .
Right?
And
when people realized there was this massive race
between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract
and the people who actually worked on the DAO itself .
So it was like this, and
but the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it.
Like, I think I I don't remember the number,
but I think it was, like,
a huge amount of the value they were able to pull that out.
Yeah.
Now the the the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account,
and everyone knew where it went because, you know, everything on the blockchain is completely transparent.
But no one could do anything about it .
Like, they couldn't take the money out, and so the money was just sitting there,
basically,
that got like, it was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something,
and no one knew what to do about this situation.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Yeah.
And
so okay.
I'm I'm I'm kind of looking back on it .
So
it was yeah.
It it blew up, and it also caused the creation.
So I remember there was a
at this time,
a hard fork debate
because
so it's pretty early .
It's, like, less than a year after Ethereum launched.
Probably a lot of the, you know, big
ether holders participated in this.
You know, they've lost significant funds, maybe all of their funds.
And the question was, like, do you make people whole,
or do you stick true to the absolute,
you know, immutability
of you know, in in the
in the classic blockchain sense where, you know,
it's totally buyer beware.
Shouldn't have put your ether in this contract if you weren't gonna you know,
if you weren't prepared to lose it.
And
the
refund group one.
You know?
So in a sense, I mean, both, like, Ethereum,
Bitcoin,
really all the projects are governed to an extent, right, by the people who develop the software and kind of,
on an ongoing basis, discuss additions
to the protocol,
you know, etcetera, etcetera .
Right?
And, you know, even in the early days of Bitcoin, I was not really around for this, but supposedly,
they had to be extremely creative about having about keeping the protocol running while not ever reverting any of the history .
Right?
So
I don't believe they did they've never done a hard fork of the nature described here, though there have been
maybe not sponsored by the founders.
Obviously, there are forks of Bitcoin now,
Bitcoin Cash, you know, all that sort of thing.
And
so the the Ethereum community elected
to
or the foundation or whatever that is,
the
the elected to
sort of forcibly revert the funds.
There's just like a almost like a credit
as of a certain block number.
So everyone got their funds back.
Jim had to code it .
Maybe I helped a little bit.
I was not coding anymore at this point.
And
so then Ethereum Classic was, like, the hard line .
Like, we're sticking the immutability.
Sorry, Jim .
Are you gonna say something?
Oh, no.
I think you were gonna say something .
No.
No.
No.
And
so Ethereum Classic got some backers.
You know, I think maybe famously,
I think Barry Silbert was in their Ethereum Classic, maybe still is.
And, eventually,
it was,
yeah, I think someday Victor, you told me this .
Right?
So
so Ethereum Classic got some backers.
And, eventually,
it was, like, the hard line.
Like, we're sticking the immutability.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So
so moving on from there,
I think it's worth noting that this hard fork debate and the resulting split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic was a significant moment in the history of blockchain technology.
It highlighted the tension between immutability, which is a core principle of blockchain, and the need for flexibility to address unforeseen issues or mistakes.
The decision to revert funds back to their original owners was seen as a compromise that allowed Ethereum to continue its development while acknowledging the mistake made by the DAO.
This event also underscored the importance of community consensus and the challenges in maintaining a decentralized network when faced with unexpected circumstances.
