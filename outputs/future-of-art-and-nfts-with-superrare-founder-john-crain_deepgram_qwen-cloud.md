Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want me to act as an expert transcript editor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain technology. The task is to clean up a raw transcript while preserving all content, technical terms, and proper names. The user provided a detailed set of rules and examples to follow.

First, I need to check the raw transcript for any technical terms or proper names that might be misspelled. The user provided lists of known people and technical terms. For example, "John Crane" is a name to correct if misspelled. Technical terms like "Ethereum," "NFTs," "DAO," and "ERC-20" need to be properly capitalized and spelled.

Next, I'll look for any instances where the speakers might have used incorrect terms. For example, "etherium" should be "Ethereum," and "nfts" should be "NFTs." Also, names like "Andreas Antonopoulos" need to be correctly spelled as per the provided list.

The user emphasized preserving all dialogue and content, so I must ensure not to summarize or condense any part of the conversation. Every technical explanation, anecdote, and discussion point must remain. I'll also check the timestamps to make sure they are in the correct [MM:SS] format and that each line of dialogue has a timestamp.

I need to correct any punctuation issues, such as missing periods or commas, and adjust sentence structure for readability without altering the original meaning. For example, if a sentence is fragmented, I'll add appropriate punctuation to make it flow better.

Another important aspect is removing excessive filler words like "um," "uh," or "you know" where they don't affect the meaning. However, I must be careful not to over-sanitize and keep the natural conversation flow intact.

I'll also ensure that all speaker labels are bolded as **SPEAKER_XX:** and that each speaker's dialogue is correctly attributed. The output should maintain the same structure as the input, with each line of dialogue followed by a timestamp.

After making these corrections, I'll verify the word count to ensure the output is approximately the same length as the input. If the output is significantly shorter, I might have removed too much content, so I'll need to go back and restore any missing dialogue.

Finally, I'll perform a thorough check to ensure all timestamps are present, properly formatted, and that the transcript adheres to the user's formatting requirements. This includes checking for any remaining errors in technical terms, proper names, and overall readability.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay.
[00:01] We are live, and we have a very special episode today.
[00:05] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs,
[00:09] and we're joined by special guest and very old friend,
[00:13] John Crane.
[00:15] Welcome, John Crane.
[00:17] Hey, Victor.
[00:18] Hey, everyone.
[00:19] Hey.
[00:20] Good to see you guys.
[00:22] Thanks for having me.
[00:24] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of Super Rare.
[00:30] But do wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:37] Yeah.
[00:38] Sure.
[00:39] So, yeah, I
[00:40] let's see.
[00:41] My crypto journey started in around 2015,
[00:46] going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met,
[00:51] at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
[00:57] Yeah.
[00:58] I was you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[01:03] I worked in advertising.
[01:05] I studied architecture and structural engineering
[01:09] for undergrad.
[01:10] And,
[01:11] yeah, I was always really interested in
[01:14] when crypto and blockchain were gonna, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were,
[01:22] a little bit past,
[01:24] you know, finance and trading.
[01:27] And so,
[01:28] yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for, digital art.
[01:34] So, yeah, it doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:39] Yeah.
[01:40] Remember

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:42] how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:47] Obviously, we met there, but, like, what was that

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:51] Yeah.
[01:52] Well?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:53] Your yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:55] So I was I was kinda hanging
[01:58] okay.
[01:59] I was wrong.
[02:01] Like, this is actually super cool.
[02:04] Like, you know, I have no problem changing.
[02:07] I was like, I was totally wrong.
[02:09] This is amazing.
[02:11] And
[02:12] I was just, like, googling
[02:14] Ethereum blockchain hackathon.
[02:17] I was, like, trying to find,
[02:19] like, get deeper involved.
[02:21] You know, I was trying like, quit my day job and go full time crypto.
[02:26] And so then I I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh, shit.
[02:31] There's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied,
[02:35] with Charles.
[02:37] And then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:40] Yeah.
[02:41] And and to be clear, you to let everyone know that
[02:45] we were blown away by you and your brother's Charles' project,
[02:51] and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in web three.
[02:57] Right?
[02:58] We gave you the Yeah.
[03:00] Yeah.
[03:01] Yeah.
[03:02] For sure.
[03:03] Exactly.
[03:05] Yeah.
[03:06] I think I

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:08] I think the, like, the Monday after
[03:11] I don't know.
[03:12] Like, I I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on block apps.
[03:18] Yeah.
[03:19] Well, I we I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were Yeah.
[03:24] Yeah.
[03:25] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:27] I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:29] transition period while

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:31] you know?
[03:32] Yeah.
[03:33] I think that's true.
[03:34] Yeah.
[03:35] Maybe it was, like, we started, like, hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then
[03:41] full time.
[03:42] So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:44] So So with Counterparty,
[03:47] you you could have been on.
[03:49] Yeah.
[03:50] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:51] If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:53] So what inspired
[03:55] SuperRare?
[03:57] Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[04:05] But, you know, what
[04:07] triggered you to kind of
[04:09] create super rare, which is what for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:15] Yeah.
[04:16] I
[04:17] well, I mean, it was super interesting.
[04:20] Right?
[04:21] You know, like, we were all kind of on the Ground Floor
[04:25] at the consensus office or, like, know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
[04:31] And, like,
[04:32] watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I met me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens, and, like,
[04:40] I found it was, like, super interesting that it was this very small
[04:45] bit of stand like, you know, it's a it's a super
[04:49] simple protocol, very simple code.
[04:52] But, like, the adoption created this like, yeah, there's massive wealth generation.
[04:58] And even if there were also lots of scams,
[05:01] I'd say generally net positive for,
[05:04] you know, humans and the economy.
[05:06] Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen.
[05:09] And
[05:10] so then I saw some of the standards conversations
[05:13] around ERC-seven
[05:15] 21, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
[05:19] And
[05:20] I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
[05:23] If you think about
[05:25] the consumer web,
[05:27] it's all,
[05:28] you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[05:32] So, like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, like
[05:38] I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the, you know, the the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
[05:46] So that got me into NFTs.
[05:48] And then
[05:49] on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, like, know, going to the art fairs.
[05:56] I had friends who were,
[05:58] you know, looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the, you know, the business of art.
[06:03] And
[06:04] it just seemed obvious.
[06:06] I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets,
[06:11] and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art.
[06:14] So it's kinda like the marriage of,
[06:17] you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:23] And, like,
[06:24] what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion?
[06:28] Because you guys like, I I know for a long time you were building, and it was like,
[06:33] oh, you know, like, how's it going?
[06:35] And, you know, the like,
[06:37] no one is really paying attention.
[06:39] And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:44] It it was absolutely crazy.
[06:47] It was hard to be like it's just, like, completely surreal the whole time.
[06:51] Like, it felt like a dream.
[06:53] Like, we,
[06:54] you know, we started in 2018.
[06:57] We we were we tried to raise money.
[07:00] It never really worked.
[07:02] Like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and, like, making more than we were paying ourselves.
[07:09] So That's best situation to possibly be.
[07:12] Yeah.
[07:13] It was, like, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[07:18] So
[07:19] it was, yeah, it was a it was a grind.
[07:22] It was super volatile many times.
[07:25] I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[07:28] But,
[07:29] yeah, then it just it just really started, like I remember
[07:33] the numbers were, like, doubling every month for a while.
[07:37] Like, remember it was October
[07:39] 2020.
[07:40] It was our first million dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild.
[07:46] You know?
[07:47] Because but,
[07:48] you know, twelve months ago, we were like, alright.
[07:51] So the volume was, like, $5,000,
[07:54] and we made a couple $100.
[07:56] Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:58] Yeah.
[07:59] And were were you guys the first self minting NFT platform?
[08:03] I think, like, we're we were trying to talk about that, actually.
[08:07] Yeah.
[08:08] We

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:10] yeah.
[08:11] We were the first to come like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but, like, we were the first to combine, like, the minting and the marketplace experience.
[08:20] So was like,
[08:21] there weren't, like, great minting tools then.
[08:24] So we're like, we started with the minting tool, and then we're like, alright.
[08:28] I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll, like, we'll build the marketplace too.
[08:33] And, you know, it's partially just out of necessity because, like, the the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[08:38] Yeah.
[08:39] I I it's it's funny because I remember, if you recall,
[08:43] the what labor became the flow guys doing CryptoKitties.
[08:48] They were based in Vancouver, and I was, like Mhmm.
[08:51] Talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.
[08:57] But
[08:58] and, I mean, you've done so much.
[09:00] One of the amazing things that it's the launch of the rare token,
[09:04] and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance
[09:10] in reality?
[09:11] Like, how how you know, what what led to that, and how did that go?
[09:16] Like, how you know, what did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:20] Yeah.
[09:21] I mean,
[09:22] you know, early on, I was, like, part of, like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where,
[09:28] you know, the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network.
[09:33] You know, like, there there's the, you know, like, the
[09:36] the fat protocol article
[09:38] that was, you know, super popular, like, 2016.
[09:41] So just, like, thinking about, like, okay.
[09:44] What does monetization look like?
[09:46] And,
[09:47] you know, can you build platforms that are,
[09:49] you know, like they're more, like, collaborative than extractive, where it's like, you know, if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and, you know, sell ads,
[09:58] you know, which is a great business.
[10:00] But, partially,
[10:01] for me, it was almost like a, you know,
[10:04] a thought experiment of, like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be, like maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kinda it's, like, collective ownership via the token.
[10:14] So,
[10:15] yeah, I was, you know, drink drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time.
[10:19] Did you trust that?
[10:21] I still am.
[10:22] Yeah.
[10:23] I guess to be Yeah.
[10:24] Yeah.
[10:25] But Did you do it, like, classic

**SPEAKER_03:**
[10:28] ICO style?
[10:29] Was there, like, fixed price auction?
[10:31] How how did it how did the rare get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:35] Yeah.
[10:36] We actually just did a huge airdrop.
[10:39] Probably one of our mistakes Yeah.
[10:42] Is, like,
[10:43] So, like, we should've probably, you know, sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away.
[10:49] And yeah.
[10:50] I mean, yeah, there's plenty of challenges to, like you know, DAOs are hard to manage and run.
[10:56] But,
[10:57] yeah, it's cool to see the current administration kinda, like, change tack and actually seem like they're interested in, like, building and pushing forward.
[11:04] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:06] What do you think the biggest challenge was in what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO?
[11:12] Because I think all of us had that sort of
[11:15] as an ideal state with the crypto kool aid, you know, running things completely decentral.
[11:20] What do you think are,
[11:22] you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:27] Yeah.
[11:28] I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory.
[11:31] Regulatory.
[11:32] Like, you have you know, like, you're kinda, like, trying to read the tea leaves, and then rather than just making, like, the bet you're like, okay.
[11:39] Well, this is the simplest, best decision.
[11:42] You're like, okay.
[11:43] Well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this.
[11:47] And, like, how do we,
[11:49] you know,
[11:50] not get in trouble for trying to experiment?
[11:53] And it's obviously you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules.
[12:00] You know, it's like
[12:01] the Do you think like, the the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:06] The dark the dark ages.
[12:08] You know?
[12:09] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[12:10] Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he?
[12:14] You know?
[12:15] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[12:16] Man.
[12:17] Do you think of it more like the advice?
[12:19] Do you think of it more like it should be, like, a representative democracy?
[12:23] Like, should be be be, like, passing bills in there?
[12:27] I I think they're, like, the proposals and there's, like, delegation usually is the model for it.
[12:32] Yeah.
[12:33] Could also be, like, just, like,
[12:35] you got a couple leaders, but the stake could call, you know, confidence vote or something or, like, people like too.
[12:41] I haven't tried it yet, but, looks like, like, MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:46] I think and and I think it kinda depends on, like, specifically what you're doing.
[12:51] You know, if it's something like,
[12:53] you know I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just, you know, where it's, like, if small changes are can have potentially, like, catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing.
[13:03] If you know it's you know, like, super where it's, like, if there's a there's a low level protocol and there's application and, like,
[13:10] you know, other than, like, the escrow contracts for auctions and things, like, the stakes are, like, fairly low.
[13:16] I do kinda like the idea of, like,
[13:18] you'd sorta like
[13:19] if you can empower, like, a team or a few individuals to kinda just keep going, and then the token holders can say, like, tell people to stop versus, like, having to approve everything.
[13:28] Like, that's
[13:29] a very silly arduous process.
[13:31] And I feel like it should be more like, okay.
[13:34] If you're it's, like,
[13:36] veering off in the wrong direction, you can like, there's a way to kinda, like, raise your voice and have influence it.
[13:42] But, like,
[13:43] you know, having a vote on, like, what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:48] I I'm curious, like, you know, given that you're a decentralization
[13:52] advocate,
[13:53] how do you balance, like,
[13:55] being a curated
[13:56] kind of platform
[13:58] and
[13:59] being open?
[14:00] You know?
[14:01] Like, how do you think about those two?
[14:04] Because I think one of the advantages of Super Rare with the curation side and art, you keep the quality very, very high.
[14:10] And Yeah.
[14:11] Unlike, you know, more marketplace type NFT platforms, which just frankly puts a ton of crap, like, out there.
[14:17] So Yeah.
[14:18] Yeah.
[14:19] How how do you balance those two?
[14:22] I I think I keep decentralized, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:25] Yeah.
[14:26] No.
[14:27] It yeah.
[14:28] I mean, it's kinda challenging, and it's almost,
[14:31] almost a paradox.
[14:33] But I think, you know, we've kind of always taken the, like, minimal decentralization.
[14:38] So it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then, you know, like, one example is, like, we were, like, talking about, like, token models early on.
[14:45] I was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists.
[14:49] And I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible
[14:53] thing I could ever imagine.
[14:55] You know?
[14:56] It's like people voting, like, your art's terrible.
[14:59] Like, you know, like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[15:02] I mean, in the the pumped up fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time.
[15:08] Exact yeah.
[15:09] You know, maybe we have people stream.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:12] Yeah.
[15:13] It's, like, live going.
[15:15] Like, is the art good or bad?
[15:17] Watch this artist

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:19] threaten to commit suicide.
[15:21] I I did do a stalk on a dating project once where where you basically had to be voted in based on your notes, which does seem horrible.
[15:28] I can see.
[15:29] Very, very evil.
[15:30] You know?
[15:31] Like But there's right now 10 pages.
[15:34] Remember those?
[15:35] Yes.
[15:36] Yes.
[15:37] Or hot or not or all of those Oh, yeah.
[15:40] Yeah.
[15:41] It's Yeah.
[15:42] Yeah.
[15:43] Just just brutal.
[15:45] But I and, yeah, especially in places
[15:48] you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:52] Yeah.
[15:53] It's challenging and, you know, art like, good art is subjective.
[15:57] So
[15:58] that, you know, it's like
[16:00] I feel like, you know, like, the on chain auctions, escrow on chain, that makes a lot of sense.
[16:05] Like,
[16:06] on chain voting for, like, which artists are good.
[16:09] You know, that's kinda, like,
[16:11] let people who are, like, making decisions, like, do their thing.
[16:15] And then if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe, like, the token holders can, like,
[16:20] you know, raise awareness.
[16:22] But
[16:23] Yeah.
[16:24] Yeah.
[16:25] That was, like, the and, like,
[16:27] part of it too I mean, actually, early on, we were, like thought we would be more of an open platform.
[16:32] And then as things progressed, there were more tools.
[16:35] Like, you know, we were just trying it was like, we were building things, trying to add value,
[16:40] and
[16:41] there's a ton of open tooling.
[16:43] So, like, early on, we kinda thought we might have, like, super areas, like, the ultra curated
[16:49] view into the market, and then maybe you have, like, you know, another kinda, like, open platform
[16:54] that's anyone

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:56] could use.
[16:57] But I'm I'm curious.
[16:58] Like, what was the like, what like, you know, it's a two sided market with market artists
[17:03] and art buyers.
[17:05] Like, what do you think like,
[17:07] did you have to get the artist first to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the art first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:12] Yeah.
[17:13] We
[17:14] you know, you kinda had to get both first.
[17:17] So, I mean, we started, like, just, you know, out of, like it really started as just me kinda, like, experimenting and building.
[17:23] And so we were, like you know, started with the minting tools.
[17:26] I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people.
[17:29] And
[17:30] I guess we it first kinda piqued interest of the artist.
[17:34] Like, I was you know, like, we were, like, talking about how it would work.
[17:38] And then
[17:39] when we when we first launched, though, we kinda had
[17:42] so there's Jason Bailey, who was kinda like a early,
[17:45] you know, digital art advocate.
[17:47] He you know, big writer.
[17:49] He ran a company or runs a company called Club NFT that does, like, NFT art backups.
[17:54] Yeah.
[17:55] And
[17:56] he hit us up and was like, hey, guys.
[17:59] Like, you know, we've been talking to him, and he was like, I know you're gonna close with your products.
[18:04] Like, I wanna buy this art on Monday.
[18:07] Can we can I do it on super air?
[18:09] And I, like, looked at Charlie, and I was like,
[18:12] dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet on Monday.
[18:16] Like, what can we do?
[18:18] Like,
[18:19] that was That was
[18:21] in, like, we had, like, thirty six hours that Charlie was like, yeah.
[18:25] Probably.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[18:27] And so then we basically stayed up for thirty six hours, fixing bugs.
[18:31] And I'm getting I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said we wanna launch blockchain as a service with you at DEFCON one, and we were like Exactly.
[18:39] Oh my god.
[18:40] Like, that's like There there are many parallels.
[18:43] Yeah.
[18:44] Exactly.
[18:45] Nothing like a good deadline to get, you know, Exactly.
[18:49] Like
[18:50] Especially with a big, you know, major

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:53] partner that, you know, can make or break you.
[18:56] Right?
[18:57] So Yeah.
[18:58] No.
[18:59] Just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:02] Well, yeah.
[19:03] Exactly.
[19:04] That's when it gets real risky.
[19:06] We actually so when we did it, there was a there was a funny bug with the, like, the React stuff.
[19:11] So we're, like, live, like, helping we were, like, live streaming or not live streaming, but, like, screen sharing the transaction with this artist, Ravi Bharat and Jason.
[19:19] And we're, like, literally pushing fixes.
[19:22] It was like, oh, we didn't know didn't expect that to happen.
[19:25] Like, okay.
[19:26] One second.
[19:27] Like, alright.
[19:28] It's deployed.
[19:29] Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:31] Lots of cash clearing in in Exactly.
[19:34] I don't remember about that.
[19:36] I you know, like, I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally, like, art and NFT is like, you know Can I jump in on this?
[19:43] Yeah.
[19:44] Please.
[19:45] Give take a take on it.
[19:47] So in DeFi, we're starting to see like, as the administration has cleared the way to some extent,

**SPEAKER_03:**
[19:52] it seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a TradFi,
[19:56] DeFi merger.
[19:57] It's not all the way there yet,
[19:59] but it's,
[20:00] you know, getting to just be FI.
[20:02] Like, I see the path to that Yeah.
[20:04] Happening.
[20:05] Do you think, like, it's NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever?
[20:10] I know, you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery.
[20:13] I know you started to do a lot of, like, physical sales.
[20:16] Yeah.
[20:17] Etcetera.
[20:18] Like, does it kinda
[20:19] what or, you know, do do they merge?
[20:21] Do they not?
[20:22] Do they Yeah.
[20:23] That does

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:25] like, chart by like, chart art become NFT art and digital art?
[20:29] Or like Yeah.
[20:30] I you know, I like, the NFT stuff, I do think kinda just, like, eventually fades into the background.
[20:36] Like, the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance.
[20:41] So, you know, you could use that for physical art.
[20:44] You could use it for digital.
[20:46] I think it was, like, more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kinda argue the token is the art.
[20:51] You now have this, you know, more liquid asset.
[20:54] So for art specifically,
[20:56] yeah, it's kinda just becoming part of the market, and I think you'll see NFTs,
[21:00] you know, used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art.
[21:05] Like, no one's really if you like
[21:08] the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and, like, collectibles in general is, like, kind of amazing.
[21:14] Like, it's still like, oh, there's a sticker on the back that this you know, says it was from this gallery.
[21:20] Probably it was.
[21:21] Like, probably it was?
[21:23] Like, nobody
[21:24] knows.
[21:25] And so
[21:26] and, also, I think, you know, like,
[21:28] a lot of people are, like, really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally.
[21:34] It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity,
[21:39] like, that's kinda good enough.
[21:41] You don't really need some complicated tech solution there.
[21:44] And
[21:45] it's hard to imagine a world in which, you know, like,
[21:48] collectors
[21:49] and, like, customers
[21:50] like, you just want like, I personally have, like, a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it.
[21:57] Yeah.
[21:58] And I think in general, that trend continues.
[22:00] So I think
[22:01] digital art will kinda just become
[22:03] a bigger part of the contemporary art market, and then eventually, we'll see
[22:08] NFTs used as certificates of authenticity,
[22:11] you know, for all,
[22:13] you know, high value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:16] Yeah.
[22:17] I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist, and she often gets a request, like,
[22:22] for the value that was paid for because someone wants to insure it.
[22:26] Right?
[22:27] And, like Yeah.
[22:28] We like, there's this whole downstream
[22:30] kind of economy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:32] Insurance, appraisal,
[22:34] like, lending.
[22:35] Like, you can't you need
[22:37] much better.
[22:38] And so it's like
[22:39] the I mean, Karen, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit.
[22:43] It's like, I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information.
[22:48] You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to
[22:52] Yeah.
[22:53] Your provenance information.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[22:55] Let me add a little on on that front.
[22:58] So I felt having been more of an NFT
[23:00] style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more DeFi,
[23:04] we I I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true.
[23:08] But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock
[23:11] liquidity in
[23:12] selling could be one way, but people kinda wanna hold on to stuff.
[23:16] Like, I don't wanna sell my ETH.
[23:18] I don't wanna sell my you know, etcetera.
[23:21] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:22] I think that's painful.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[23:24] You would know better than us.
[23:26] At the very high end of the market, you know, if you get, like, a wealth manager,
[23:30] they'll they might extend some credit against your Picasso,
[23:33] right, or what have you.
[23:35] But for everybody else and you probably have to have a a lot of separate money for that too.
[23:40] You can't really like, I don't know if people fire sell their art, but it tends to sit there.
[23:45] And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there, but the credit markets actually just make it liquid, you know, as we've
[23:51] as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool.
[23:54] Like Yeah.
[23:55] I'm surprised.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:57] We're we're getting into that world, but we're not Yeah.
[24:00] I I we're seeing it.
[24:02] I feel like it's the green shoots of, okay.
[24:05] Here's what's possible.
[24:07] It totally makes sense.
[24:08] I think just like,
[24:09] NFTs almost is is, like they're a great you know, like, we've talked a lot people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff.
[24:15] And, like, to me, it's like NFTs are, like, a beautiful, very simple
[24:19] digital identity for whatever.
[24:21] You can pack anything you want in that metadata.
[24:24] It's just, like, pack it full of stuff.
[24:26] It's very simple.
[24:27] They're unique.
[24:28] Point to one they're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[24:31] Yeah.
[24:32] I mean, I I love the way you talk about, you know, NFTs as certificates of authenticity because I didn't realize this.
[24:38] We looked into, like, the physical art market for a while, and, like, every auction at Sotheby's when they have a big piece,
[24:44] like, they have to research it effectively from scratch.
[24:47] Right?
[24:48] Like, they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:53] Yeah.
[24:54] It's a very high friction
[24:56] like, the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good, you know, like, depending on where your position is in the market.
[25:02] Like, obviously, loves
[25:03] being the,
[25:04] you know, the keeper of all secrets and information.
[25:07] Okay.
[25:08] Cool.
[25:09] But I, yeah, I think that's clearly gonna be disintermediated
[25:12] with technology.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[25:14] Any new or maybe
[25:16] you are you guys, you know, just to declare war on the auction houses, houses, you know, other high end physical goods?
[25:22] What

**SPEAKER_01:**
[25:24] Yeah.
[25:25] I mean, we're focusing like, our expansion like, you know, we launched the gallery earlier this year,
[25:30] offline gallery.
[25:31] It's on the Bowery,
[25:33] right next to the new museum.
[25:35] And,
[25:36] you know, we're showing physical,
[25:38] digital art, you know, installations,
[25:40] you know, projections,
[25:42] all sorts of different things.
[25:44] And, yeah, I think, like, you know, our view like, if you look at the models, like, they're all like, the galleries are not doing great, you know, business wise.
[25:52] The the auction houses are hurting.
[25:54] I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model.
[25:57] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[25:59] It's stuff is so illiquid.
[26:01] Right?
[26:02] I don't mean to interrupt.
[26:04] Right?
[26:05] It's just I think the norm is stuff sitting five years, ten years with you know, and it's feast or famine.
[26:11] Like, if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions.
[26:14] Yep.
[26:15] Just wait.
[26:16] Yeah.
[26:17] Like, 2021,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:19] people were just, you know, you know, buying Picassos on their phones on, like, online.
[26:24] And

**SPEAKER_00:**
[26:25] And crazy ape

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:27] crazy apes.
[26:28] Right?
[26:29] So Yeah.
[26:30] They all everything.
[26:32] Every know, ether rocks.
[26:34] I remember when ether rocks were, like, the price is exploding, and I was like, this is truly
[26:39] amazing.
[26:40] Yeah.
[26:41] But, yeah, I think, like,
[26:43] the models have to change.
[26:45] And, you know, just as, like, if you think what the Internet's done as far as, like,
[26:49] shopping.
[26:50] Right?
[26:51] It's like you can price compare easily on your phone in any storage.
[26:55] Right?
[26:56] There's no kinda, like, price arbitrage.
[26:59] You're, like, you're gonna look up the price of something.
[27:02] You can scan something, figure, and you're, like, ask chat GBT.
[27:06] What is, you know, what is this?
[27:08] How much should it cost?
[27:10] And so I think, like,
[27:11] the art world has really it has been a, like, an insider's game of who knows who and, like, what's the real price, like, the marketed price versus, like, what was actually paid.
[27:20] And I think that's gonna like, it's gonna slowly be like, unwinding,
[27:23] and we'll see we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent.
[27:28] You can see things on chain.
[27:30] And,
[27:31] I mean, I think that's, you know, like, that's kinda, like, part of the opportunity is,
[27:35] you know, as the market becomes more efficient,
[27:37] we'll have the best tools to to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[27:40] So it sounds like even the big guys want more liquidity,
[27:43] but they're not willing to, like, let go of their proprietary information advantage, I guess.
[27:48] Yeah.
[27:49] Is that fair to say?
[27:50] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[27:51] And I but it's and I like, that's a kind of also the paradox.
[27:55] It's like, you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information, but, like,
[27:59] you know, it's the classic
[28:01] what's
[28:02] the The what?
[28:03] In what?
[28:04] The Innovator's dilemma?
[28:06] The Innovator's dilemma.
[28:08] Exactly.
[28:09] I was like, yeah.
[28:10] Tip my tongue.
[28:11] Yeah.
[28:12] Classic Innovator's dilemma.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:14] Well, I I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer, right, to to their places.
[28:21] Yeah.
[28:22] They have,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:23] I mean, I you know, like, they're all Christie's and some of the like, a lot of the big or most of the auction houses are private.
[28:29] So I don't know how big their businesses are, but
[28:32] they
[28:33] do have,
[28:34] yep.
[28:35] There's, like you know, people will, like, inherit art, and it's like they don't really care necessarily,
[28:40] and their adviser was like, don't sell that.
[28:43] You should just take out a loan.
[28:45] And so they do have them.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:47] But that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point.
[28:50] Right?
[28:51] Like,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:52] oh, we'll tell you how much it's worth, and we'll loan you based on that.
[28:56] Yeah.
[28:57] It's very one-sided, and you can't really shop it around.
[29:00] It's like ultra specialized information.
[29:02] Jim, did you wanna ask a question?
[29:04] You look like you you came off mute.
[29:07] Well, it's a little bit of a different topic, but I I I'll throw it in right now anyway.
[29:12] What
[29:13] has been the effect for good or bad of of AI on in art on what you're doing?
[29:18] Yeah.
[29:19] It
[29:20] I mean, as far as the the startup goes, it's been great.
[29:23] We're like, you know, you can we got a little robot on our Slack you can talk to that does things for you.
[29:28] As far as the art market goes,
[29:30] I think it's all I mean, it's also been kinda great.
[29:33] Like, in my mind, this is just like a
[29:35] you know, it's a new tool that unlocks
[29:37] create you know, like, you can kind of, like, do different creative things.
[29:41] It You're
[29:42] in close to encouraging it then.
[29:44] Yeah.
[29:45] Oh, yeah.
[29:46] We have, like, tons of artists use AI.
[29:49] I mean, you know, there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and, you know, think it's the the end of all creativity.
[29:56] But I think just, like, you know, if you look
[29:58] history I think you like, what it really enables is, like, somebody to do more complex things.
[30:03] You know, it's like where you can, like, all the grunt work you don't have to do.
[30:07] So now maybe it's instead of making one still image,
[30:10] you're gonna do insane world building where it's like you can go in, you can you know, like, the art's just more interactive.
[30:16] And, actually, the first art we ever sold on Super Air was kinda, like, generated via, like,
[30:21] GAN.
[30:22] It's, like, adversarial networks, like, voting on outcomes.
[30:26] So I think, you know, it's inevitable.
[30:28] It's gonna happen.
[30:30] It's kinda like, you know, digital cameras with the end of photography, and they obviously were not

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:35] But do do you think, like you know, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority that
[30:40] proving some part was based
[30:42] you know, done by a human will be valued into

**SPEAKER_01:**
[30:45] our kind of or or any kind of creation going forward.
[30:48] Yeah.
[30:49] I mean, I think yeah.
[30:50] Just, if you you know, it's like it's super amazing to see, like, the rate at which content's being created and, like, you know,
[30:56] people it's like you can watch a video of, like, that person didn't actually say that, but, looks like they did.
[31:02] I think that's where
[31:03] you know, like,
[31:04] nobody ever answers a random phone number.
[31:07] If someone's calling you and it it's not in your phone, you're like, I I literally never answered this.
[31:12] Like, I don't know who does that.
[31:14] You have to be, like, pretty insane.
[31:17] And so it's sorta like, you've kinda certified the, like, the numbers you know, and I think it'll end up being the same with, like, content and, like, art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't,
[31:25] you know, signed
[31:26] somehow cryptographically,
[31:28] you'll probably just assume it's fake.
[31:30] Yeah.
[31:31] Because there's there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[31:34] Have you seen much interest
[31:36] on
[31:37] the Bitcoin side
[31:38] in terms of ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and runes?
[31:42] Like, how how Yeah.
[31:44] Is that looking?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[31:46] Yeah.
[31:47] We've done a couple projects on runes
[31:49] with artists.
[31:50] And, yeah, it's super interesting.
[31:52] You know, we're
[31:53] yeah.
[31:54] I think there's gonna be art on many blockchains.
[31:57] Obviously, you know, Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure probably have the highest likelihood of, you know, it lasting.
[32:04] But, yeah, it's
[32:05] actually, people really like ordinals.
[32:07] It's funny.
[32:08] One of the sort of paradoxes that or, like, the funny things we ran into is, like, early on, we would talk to, like, investors, and they're like, you need to get rid of the wallet.
[32:15] It's too complicated.
[32:17] But, actually, it kinda ends up being this, like, you gotta know all the right terms.
[32:21] It's almost like you get the secret incantation.
[32:23] You get inducted into the club, and you know how it works.
[32:27] And so, like,
[32:28] I think people really like that ordinals are a little more complex and, like, harder to understand than NFTs
[32:34] on Ethereum,
[32:35] which is just yeah.
[32:36] It's sort of that's a funny anecdote.
[32:38] But, yeah, they're quite popular.
[32:40] I, you know, I think they'll be around for a while.
[32:43] And

**SPEAKER_02:**
[32:45] And, I mean, another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.
[32:52] Yep.
[32:53] Yeah.
[32:54] Totally.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[32:56] I I'm curious about the decision to you know, you mentioned starting the gallery.
[33:01] And, like, everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real world stuff into the blockchain,
[33:06] but you're kind of doing the opposite.
[33:08] Like, what was the decision to start a physical gallery?
[33:11] And, you know, why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[33:16] Yeah.
[33:17] I mean, just
[33:18] you know, it's part it's kinda part of, like, how, you know, like, the the market works.
[33:23] So, like, in you know, people like getting together.
[33:27] And, like, a lot of the art, you know, it's like you
[33:30] can look at it on your phone, but if you see it, you know, on the huge projector, there's, like, you know, a a 10 by 10
[33:36] CRT,
[33:37] like, TV wall.
[33:38] It really looks different.
[33:40] So I think, you know, part of it is, like, it's community building.
[33:44] It's a space people can show up, and then part of it's, you know, like, the art really does just look different.
[33:50] So I think, you know, as far as, like,
[33:52] NFT is still you know, people are like, okay.
[33:55] These are just
[33:56] nonsense
[33:57] JPEGs.
[33:58] They're you know, it's, you know, it's ether rocks two point o or what I like.
[34:02] And so, like, it's kind of, like, telling the story to everyone else.
[34:06] Because at the end of the day, it's still, like you know, it's it's a demand constrained market, and we're, you know, we're trying to grow the collector base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[34:12] Be beyond art, what do you see as, like, the next area?
[34:16] Like, you know, what's the next areas that are kind of gonna need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority?
[34:22] I mean, I can think of a million, but I'm just curious.
[34:25] From your point of view, where do you see where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[34:30] Yeah.
[34:31] I
[34:32] I mean, I think in general, it's like, you know, like, luxury assets where, like, NFTs are still more expensive
[34:38] to create than, like, not having one.
[34:40] You know, like, you just print one out, and then the ID lives in your database.
[34:45] Yeah.
[34:46] And it you know, it's and I think but it's gonna be, like, the customers are gonna have to demand it.
[34:51] You know, like, a lot of, like, the brokers and folks, like, they do, their kinda, like, information
[34:56] advantage,
[34:57] and so they don't really want this to exist.
[35:00] But I think
[35:01] it just makes so much sense.
[35:03] It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen.
[35:06] So and we're see like, you know, there's people taking wine very seriously,
[35:10] issuing NFTs,
[35:11] and, like, you know, building secondary markets.
[35:14] So I think part of it's, like,
[35:15] an asset that's kinda fun to speculate on, but also you do you know, like, there's, you know, a high likelihood you might, you know, have somebody send you the NFT.
[35:23] So, like, kinda like wine,
[35:24] watches.

[36:14] I mean, it's like
[36:15] it's obviously like we you know, like, we've all been working on this for, like, a super long time, but I do think, like, if

[36:25] like, moving on chain, like
[36:27] like, everything

[36:40] We're like, holy fuck.
