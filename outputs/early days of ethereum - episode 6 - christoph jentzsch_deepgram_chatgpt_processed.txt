**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay.
[00:01] Recording is in progress, it says.
[00:03] So hello, everybody.
[00:05] Today, delighted to have Christophe with us.
[00:09] We did attempt to record this, Christophe and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button.
[00:15] So we spoke for an hour or so, and then it was not recorded.
[00:20] So this is round two.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:23] So hello, Christophe.
[00:25] How are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:27] Hi, Bob. Nice to meet you again.
[00:30] I'm doing good. I hope you too.
[00:33] Thanks for the invitation.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:35] Fantastic. Yeah.
[00:38] So Christophe and I, you know, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015,
[00:44] when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch.
[00:48] This was around the time that Christophe was still at the Ethereum Foundation.
[00:51] And then I think I crossed paths a number of times since.
[00:55] Indeed. So Christophe, what were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:03] So the journey actually started in 2013.
[01:06] I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics, actually about self-organizing systems — like biological systems, mathematical biology, and other things.
[01:14] So I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior.

[01:19] I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency.
[01:24] The reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs, like graphics cards,
[01:27] and the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs.

[01:34] That's how I got into Bitcoin mining.
[01:36] I bought my first Bitcoin, got into this bubble, read everything I could about it, and then I came across the white paper from Ethereum.
[01:44] Early 2014, maybe January or February, in some Bitcoin forum somewhere.

[01:49] I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decentralized currency and all the characteristics and features of it.
[01:55] And this white paper of Vitalik — I mean, if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy.

[01:59] Except for NFTs, everything’s in there — DAOs, ENS, names as domain names as terms, and all of that.

[02:05] For me, it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin,
[02:09] but not just a currency — everything else.

[02:12] So then I started reading everything about it.
[02:15] Still in 2014, in summer — the crowdsale was in 07/14, right?
[02:19] Right, yeah — the crowdsale.

[02:21] So around the time the crowdsale happened, I watched a video from Gavin Wood.
[02:25] He was somewhere in Scandinavia — some conference in the Nordics — and he talked about Ethereum.
[02:30] I loved it. He said he wanted to open up an office in Berlin and was looking for C++ developers.

[02:36] I was a C++ developer. In theoretical physics, it's 90% software development. So I said, “Well, I want to do this.”

[02:41] So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation and paused my PhD for like three or six months.
[02:47] I thought it was just a short project — they had raised money. Maybe six months, twelve, eighteen months, or so — then it’s over.

[02:53] When I started, I expected three to six months, then I’d go back to my PhD.
[02:57] So I worked there with Ethereum — with Gavin Wood. It was a great time.
[03:01] And then I just decided to stay. It was so exciting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:04] So you never got to be a doctor?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:06] No, I'm not a doctor.
[03:07] I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left — which was kind of a pity.
[03:11] I worked for like three years on that.

[03:13] But I also had, at the time, I think four or five kids and needed some money.
[03:18] I didn’t earn much as a PhD student, so I did some software development as a side hustle basically.

[03:22] So when I got this project, I said, “Well, let’s do this for two or three months on parental leave, and then I can return.”
[03:27] And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD.
[03:30] I thought I’d return one year later because I assumed the foundation would eventually run out of money — they weren’t making any profits.

[03:36] They just raised donations, then spend them — then it's over.
[03:39] That was the original plan. But things came out differently.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:42] I mean, I guess it's never too late, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:45] I actually sometimes think about it — if I should return.
[03:47] It's just so much to learn again.
[03:49] Right now, I'm doing Tokenize It — I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies.

[03:54] It works very well.
[03:55] So currently, I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:59] No, because, I mean, famously, you had Doctor Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian, as well.
[04:03] And I think — yeah, I think there were a couple of other PhDs too.
[04:06] There definitely were.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:07] I also dropped out of mine.
[04:09] I was actually in mathematical physics too — interesting, similar background.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:12] Yeah, actually the same.
[04:13] Theoretical physics — it's the mathematical part of physics.
[04:16] I focused on thermodynamics and statistics — mostly software development.
[04:20] It was really fun.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:22] By the way, Jim is trying to join. I don't know if anything needs to happen — maybe he's having some browser issue.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:27] Yeah, yeah.
[04:29] Well, he'll pop up and we can add him — or if not, then never mind.

[04:33] So Christophe, in terms of getting hired into EF dev — and I’m sorry if I missed it — how did that happen?
[04:39] Did you meet Gavin at a meetup, did you say?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:43] Yes.
[04:44] Actually, no — I only listened to his talk. It was just an online thing.
[04:48] I just wrote him an email and said, “Look, I would love to join you. I love what you're doing.”

[04:53] And he invited me to meet him in Kreuzberg, Berlin — which again is about two hours’ drive from here.
[04:57] So I went up there, met him.
[04:59] I remember the first conversation — he was talking about all the stuff they were going to build.
[05:03] He said, “Well, what can you do?”

[05:04] I just asked him, “What's the most complicated stuff you have right now? Give me a complicated task — I’ll figure it out somehow.”

[05:09] So he talked about the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which needed some testing.
[05:12] So I picked working on testing the Ethereum Virtual Machine — writing tests for it.

[05:16] Back at the time, I actually had no real idea what he was talking about.
[05:20] Meaning, of course, I understood it on the white paper level — what Ethereum was about.
[05:24] But Gavin had this skill of writing the yellow paper, which is still an incredible work.

[05:29] It’s a great specification — unlike Bitcoin, which never really had one.
[05:33] Gavin defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine in a formal way.

[05:36] I think I read the yellow paper six or seven times.
[05:38] I felt like I was one out of 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood it.
[05:43] I submitted corrections to it — I have some pull requests in the yellow paper GitHub repo, adding missing definitions and stuff like that.

[05:49] What I mostly did was writing tests according to the specification,
[05:52] which then were run using the C++ client because that was the team I worked in.

[05:56] So I was also working on the C++ codebase.
[05:59] Then there was Geth (Go Ethereum), Py-EVM, JavaScript EVM implementations, Haskell client, and others.

[06:04] They were basically using my tests to verify that their machines —
[06:07] also the state transitions and block creation — were implemented correctly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:11] Yeah.
[06:12] Just to give some timeline for the viewers — Vitalik wrote the white paper in November 2013.
[06:17] Various other people joined the effort in December, including Gavin and Jeff, who started the C++ and Go clients, respectively.

[06:23] At the very end — oh my goodness — the very end of December, like a Christmas project from both of them.
[06:27] January 2014, you had the public announcements...
