Okay, so I need to process this raw transcript into a clean, readable format while preserving all the content. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. The main goal is to create a transcript that's easy to read but keeps every part of the conversation.

First, I need to check the technical terms and proper names against the provided lists. The user mentioned known people and technical terms, so I should make sure all names like Vitalik, Gavin Wood, etc., are correctly spelled. Also, terms like Ethereum, Bitcoin, DAOs, etc., need to be capitalized properly.

Next, the timestamps. The user wants one timestamp per speaker paragraph at the beginning. I need to figure out the approximate timing based on the original transcript. Since there are no timestamps provided, I'll have to estimate them. Maybe start at 00:00 and increment based on the length of each speaker's turn. But the user mentioned that the timestamps should be in MM:SS format, rounded to the nearest second. I'll need to make sure each paragraph has a unique timestamp.

Then, merging consecutive speech into paragraphs. Each time a speaker changes, a new paragraph starts with a new timestamp. I'll have to look at the raw transcript and group the lines by speaker. For example, SPEAKER_00 and SPEAKER_01 alternate, so each of their turns becomes a paragraph.

I also need to correct any obvious typos or formatting issues. For instance, "Etherium" should be "Ethereum," and "NFTs" should be capitalized. Also, fixing any incorrect capitalization in proper nouns like "Bitcoin" and "Ethereum."

The user emphasized not to summarize or condense the content. So even if there are long sentences or repeated phrases, they should stay as they are. I'll have to make sure not to remove any anecdotes or technical explanations, even if they seem redundant.

Another thing to watch out for is the structure. Each speaker's paragraph should start with the bolded timestamp and speaker label, followed by the paragraph. No markdown, just plain text with the specified format. Also, ensuring that there's a blank line between each paragraph.

I need to check the word count to ensure the output is approximately the same length as the input. If the input is around 15,000 words, the output should be between 13,500 to 16,500 words. I'll have to count the words after processing to verify this.

Let me start by going through the raw transcript line by line. I'll identify each speaker's turn, correct any technical terms, fix proper names, and add the appropriate timestamps. Since there are no original timestamps, I'll have to estimate them based on the length of each speaker's contribution. For example, a short line might take about 5 seconds, while a longer paragraph could take 15-20 seconds. I'll increment the timestamps accordingly.

I'll also need to handle the technical terms. For instance, "dapp" should be "dapp," "DAO" as "DAO," and ensure that all acronyms are correctly capitalized. Proper names like "Vitalik" should be checked against the provided list to ensure accuracy.

After processing each line, I'll format it with the speaker label, timestamp, and the paragraph. I'll make sure there's a blank line between each paragraph. Once done, I'll review the transcript to ensure all content is preserved, the formatting is correct, and the word count meets the requirement.

Finally, I'll do a final check to ensure that all technical terms and proper names are correctly spelled, the timestamps are in the right format, and the structure adheres to the user's specifications. This should result in a clean, readable transcript that meets all the given criteria.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So welcome to early days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Samuel here at Dark Prague with my good friend, exiled server Michael Parenti. Hello.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** Hey, good to see you again, Bob.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_00:** Good to see you too.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:** It's the first place, first city we ever met.

**[00:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** DEFCON 4, man.

**[00:17] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. 2018.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_01:** First hug that I got from you.

**[00:21] SPEAKER_00:** There we are.

**[00:23] SPEAKER_01:** You were competing with Grif for being the best hug.

**[00:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right, well, there we go. There we go. Yeah. So I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since, but today, you know, really wanted to talk to you in terms of. Of the early days of Ethereum project and you know, looking back to. To beginning. So I mean, what, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?

**[00:45] SPEAKER_01:** Before Ethereum involvement, I was at the Bitcoin foundation, basically. Yeah. So that was my place in the craziness of this space going through. I joined the Bitcoin foundation just months before Mount Gox collapsed.

**[00:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, that was a fun time.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_01:** Right. And you know, Mark Capellis was one of the founders, co founders of the Bitcoin Foundation.

**[01:05] SPEAKER_00:** Magical tux.

**[01:07] SPEAKER_01:** That was really funny.

**[01:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[01:11] SPEAKER_01:** And then Charlie Schremm getting arrested. Right.

**[01:14] SPEAKER_00:** Two of your directors getting arrested in short order is not really fantastic.

**[01:17] SPEAKER_01:** So that was an interesting time. And so, I mean, in terms of Ethereum, so Vitalik was on the scene very early as a bitcoiner. Right. And very active in the forum.

**[01:25] SPEAKER_00:** So young at the start, eh, 17 I think, when it started.

**[01:28] SPEAKER_01:** And then Bitcoin magazine started. Right. Together. Him and Mihaly started that up. And so Vitalik was on my radar just because he was present in the community. You know, there's so few of us at the time. It's like stunning how few people there were at the beginning, you know, and how present a lot of those people still are.

**[01:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[01:47] SPEAKER_01:** And, and so I was following, you know, we had blogs before social media.

**[01:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right. Long form writing, who thought writing.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_01:** And so I still had my RSS feeds and Vitalik had a blog, so he was in my RSS feeds and one day he posted something about Ethereum and so I like, okay, cool, you.

**[02:02] SPEAKER_00:** Know, was that first thing, was it the white paper or did you.

**[02:05] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no.

**[02:07] SPEAKER_00:** He was just some posts.

**[02:09] SPEAKER_01:** He was talking about the future of digital autonomous corporations and daos. Right, right. And I forget what the exact title of the, of the blog post was that announced Ethereum.

**[02:15] SPEAKER_00:** I remember there was something that was like Ultimate Scripting. Does that sound familiar? Because I know prior to getting to that sort of baked Ethereum vision, because he had been doing work within Mastercoin colored coin, that there was some of these pre phases of, well, how could you do. How could you do different kind of scripting? And then an uncertainty of where that might land.

**[02:35] SPEAKER_01:** So that term doesn't really ring a bell with me or whatever. But so anyway, so he posted about Ethereum for the first time on his blog. And I tweeted that out. And so apparently I'm the first person that ever tweeted about Ethereum is my claim to fame.

**[02:48] SPEAKER_00:** Well, that's fantastic. We're gonna have to dig out that tweet, aren't we? And then find the exact date on that. And then maybe the Internet Archive can find the blog post.

**[02:58] SPEAKER_01:** It's on the original. It's on. It's. It's on Twitter. I've.

**[03:02] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, I mean in terms of the actual link to the blog itself, I think the.

**[03:05] SPEAKER_01:** I think the, the link might still work is still valid.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[03:09] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[03:11] SPEAKER_00:** On.

**[03:12] SPEAKER_01:** On Vitalik's blog. And funnily, I. When the NFT craze happened, there was this, a project called Sent, and they, you know, you could turn a tweet into an nft.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_00:** And that's C E N T, right?

**[03:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, C E N T. And I get this message, I get. I get a DM from somebody, hey, you know, if you mint this as a tweet, I'll, you know, I'll buy it, you know, And I was like, how much you want to buy it for? He's like, you know, I'll give you 200 bucks. And I was like, for the first tweet of Ethereum? Nah. But I guess I'll mint it, right? You know, and so, so I minted the tweet and ended up. So it's actually the second most expensive tweet behind Jack Dorsey's tweet.

**[03:45] SPEAKER_00:** I was gonna say that I remembered because Jack did his first, didn't he? Like the. His very first tweet.

**[03:50] SPEAKER_01:** So those two, those two tweets are the. Are the highest, you know, paid for a tweet.

**[03:53] SPEAKER_00:** There you go.

**[03:55] SPEAKER_01:** And so I, I minted it. And some crackhead like NFT trader in Dubai, you know, bought it off me for $21,000. Right.

**[04:03] SPEAKER_00:** That's fantastic.

**[04:05] SPEAKER_01:** And so I, the guy that originally messaged me, I gave him 10% of that.

**[04:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, nice.

**[04:09] SPEAKER_01:** And he was in Argentina, and he was a schoolteacher.

**[04:12] SPEAKER_00:** Wow.

**[04:13] SPEAKER_01:** And he took that 2100 and he turned it into, like, an educational program for Ethereum in Argentina and turned it into a career. And like a year later, he wrote me back and he was like, wow, man, that was so cool that you did that. And it meant it's totally changed my life. And now I'm teaching about Ethereum and I have school, class of children, and I have all of these things, and I'm living from being an Ethereum educator. Right, right.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_00:** Awesome. Awesome.

**[04:37] SPEAKER_01:** So that was. That was the earliest time about Ethereum.

**[04:39] SPEAKER_00:** And So it's probably November 2013, I'd have thought.

**[04:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. November 2013. I think that's exactly when it was. And yeah. So, you know, Vitalik, I saw at various meetups when he, you know, I think there was a yellow paper first. Right? First there was a. Yeah, so the.

**[04:55] SPEAKER_00:** Well, so, yeah, so the white paper that. That was November, like you say. I guess there's some prior blogs before. Right. Here's a fully formed white paper, which then he sent out to some random group of people and they passed it on to further people. And that was sort of like how the beginning of that, people getting together to start doing that happened.

**[05:10] SPEAKER_01:** So I have, like, another sort of, like, interconnection that the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought Whiskey for Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party.

**[05:20] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[05:21] SPEAKER_01:** And Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys.

**[05:24] SPEAKER_00:** Right, okay.

**[05:25] SPEAKER_01:** And they. They were sitting in York Platzer's Bar in. In Berlin, room 77, which is where the earliest bitcoin meetups were happening.

**[05:30] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, okay.

**[05:31] SPEAKER_01:** And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol and with crypto.

**[05:34] SPEAKER_00:** Right. With bitcoin.

**[05:36] SPEAKER_01:** And so Smari had tweeted that he was going to Jorg's Bar. And I was like, okay, cool, I've definitely got to buy you a whiskey. So we did this over Twitter, and I published the transaction, you know, on Twitter.

**[05:45] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[05:46] SPEAKER_01:** To see that it was confirmed. And I, you know, bought them whiskey in Yorkplatz Bar. And so York Platzer is one of the original members here of Parallel Nipolis. Right?

**[05:55] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah, right. Okay.

**[05:57] SPEAKER_01:** The role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives, like, a vibe of, you know, where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jorg used to do here. And so, yeah, there's, like, an interesting connection. And so room 77 is actually where it is that Vitalik Gavin decided to literally to actually do Ethereum.

**[06:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_01:** Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir Tahmi, who's also here in the house. And so like, this house is really like interconnected for me with all of these people, this social nexus. Yeah, yeah, Because Mike Goulski, who was my partner in Bitcoiners Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the. The module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin foundation, was an original member of this house and he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taki.

**[06:35] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[06:36] SPEAKER_01:** And also the one who introduced me to Lynn Ulbricht.

**[06:38] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[06:39] SPEAKER_01:** And he's the guy that started freeross.org right, right. So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but it's kind of. To talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin.

**[06:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[06:51] SPEAKER_01:** Because, you know, it was. It was an ICO on. It was an ICO on Bitcoin. Right.

**[06:55] SPEAKER_00:** And you were not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primarily aware these people were.

**[07:00] SPEAKER_01:** Coming through Vienna as well? So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have metalab, which is the second earliest hacker space after ccc. Right, right. In Europe. So there was Noise Bridge in San Francisco and CCC and metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at Riot Ria T T from Matthias Tarsiewicz and Ralph, and they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally was at. Was. Was that Riot?

**[07:25] SPEAKER_00:** Right, there you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper, so that the timeline on that is both Gav and Jeff Wilker started their Ethereum stuff within days of each other, just after Christmas. So, you know, like. Or just before, actually. So Gav's first commit was December 23, 2013. And I think Jeff's. Was it like a couple of days later. Well, so it was basically like a thing to do over the Christmas holidays, I think for both of them.

**[07:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. If you look at the email. Right. Or the about me.

**[07:48] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[07:49] SPEAKER_01:** Message that you have.

**[07:50] SPEAKER_00:** You know. That's right, yeah. So Gav said, you know, hey, Johnny gave me the heads up about Ethereum. So that was. I mean. Oh, goodness, I forget his name now. James Harrison. Anyway, he was one of the guys in London, so with. With Amir. So, you know, Gav had met Johnny through Amir and Johnny had told him about Ethereum and then he contacted Vitalik. But then, yeah, they got going there.

**[08:10] SPEAKER_01:** Then there was Cody Wilson was. It was there as well.

**[08:12] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right, yep, Cody. Cody in there.

**[08:14] SPEAKER_01:** And I saw the shot of video.

**[08:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, video of Cody in Canada. So Jack. Yeah. So January of 2014, you had the Bitcoin Miami where Ethereum first got announced. And then they had the house that Anthony Diorio had rented where they all sort of met physically for the first time. Well, not everyone, but many, many people.

**[08:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So these were things that were all tangentially on my online presence.

**[08:33] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right, right.

**[08:34] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, you know, you talk about crypto, Twitter and it's truly really the place where, you know, all these, these social groups intersected. You knew what people were doing because people were posting about what's going on. So then you asked me about.

**[08:45] SPEAKER_00:** But then, Sorry, so. So yeah, it was by April they had this bitcoin expo in Toronto, but that was also when the yellow paper had been done. Yeah. So Gavin spent those four months basically building the first working client and doing the yellow paper spec.

**[08:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah.

**[08:56] SPEAKER_00:** But Berlin you were saying.

**[08:58] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so. And you know, so Berlin here in Europe was, you know, the. Basically the city. You know, so there's Prague for the crypto anarchist. Right. But Berlin is really was the city for Ethereum. Right. And so I was involved with the Department of Centralization. Right. So also doing what it is I do here as an emcee on stage at East Port Berlin with, with the DoD. And then also we did the launch of Girly. Net.

**[09:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah, yeah.

**[09:16] SPEAKER_01:** So they're also in, In Berlin was a DOD production.

**[09:18] SPEAKER_00:** Do you know where the funding for that came from?

**[09:20] SPEAKER_01:** It was just.

**[09:21] SPEAKER_00:** There was no funding for Girly.

**[09:23] SPEAKER_01:** There was no funding for Girly. They just, they just did it Afri and Mr. Leagy, you know, and yeah, it was like two or three people that, you know, that deployed Girlynet.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_00:** So I can tell you the answer is actually from the Etc Cooperative.

**[09:33] SPEAKER_01:** Funding for Girlynet came from the Etc Cooperative.

**[09:35] SPEAKER_00:** So it was supposedly a collaboration between the Etc Cooperative and the Ethereum Foundation. But then the foundation didn't come through with the money. I think they did later. But yes, that's how that happened.

**[09:45] SPEAKER_01:** So I was there as. So we hosted the conference there. Girlycon. There's in my, in my YouTube playlist, there's the Girlycon, you know, hosting video. And then also when we deployed, we deployed it, you know, like pressing the button, watching the screen. Yeah, it's all live because there were.

**[09:55] SPEAKER_00:** Actually two that were launched that day.

**[09:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[09:58] SPEAKER_00:** Which was Goarly and Coti.

**[10:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[10:01] SPEAKER_00:** So Coti was the ETC version.

**[10:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's right.

**[10:04] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, that was funded by the. It's a cooperative.

**[10:06] SPEAKER_01:** That's fucking hilarious. Right? Yeah. So. So Berlin is a major place in Europe because, you know, I can't travel off the continent. Right, Right. So. So I was never able to go to London and you know, be in London or go to Ethan or anything like that. Yeah. So. So I got active in Ethereum. The reason I got active in Ethereum was after the block size wars.

**[10:25] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[10:26] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean Bitcoin was just so toxic.

**[10:28] SPEAKER_00:** Right. And just thinking nothing's ever gonna happen here.

**[10:30] SPEAKER_01:** This is like traumatized, whatever. And then there was just all of this bright eyed, bushy tailed, idealistic, you know, unicorns and glitter, you know.

**[10:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[10:36] SPEAKER_01:** And I'm an old hippie. Right. And it just was like a natural. It was like a, you know, moth to a flame, you know, to be involved with it there quite a different vibe. And so, so Eth. Berlin was a very, very cool thing at that time. And. And at that time I was working with Status.

**[10:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right, right.

**[10:51] SPEAKER_01:** I was the resident cypherpunk at Status.

**[10:53] SPEAKER_00:** Were many of those in. In Europe.

**[10:55] SPEAKER_01:** What do you mean?

**[10:56] SPEAKER_00:** So like on Status, where were people working on Status Base generally or all over the place?

**[10:59] SPEAKER_01:** There was obviously a Berlin entity, you know, so Carl, one of the co founders. So obviously they were doing the jurisdictional arbitrage between a foundation for management of their token and then where it is. But Berlin was the entity where a lot of people were paid out of and then they have a Singapore entity, I believe and stuff. But we were distributed. We were distributed 24. 7 status and so that was really cool. So that's. So with. With. With E Status and. And Department of Centralization was my. Was my primary involvement.

**[11:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[11:21] SPEAKER_01:** And so by being in Berlin, you know, you're involved with Gnosis. Right. And. And what was the. The video streaming portal anyway? They were another huge 2017 ICO that was based in Berlin.

**[11:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[11:31] SPEAKER_01:** Because we had full node there. Right? Yeah, yeah.

**[11:33] SPEAKER_00:** So did you ever spend time like visiting or within the FDEV or Parity offices?

**[11:36] SPEAKER_01:** So I never were in either, either of the offices, but you know, I know numerous people. So Kai Gertler, who's the system administrator for Giveth. Right, right. And a lot of other things was like in Eth. Cat Herders and.

**[11:45] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**[11:46] SPEAKER_01:** And stuff like that. Why did I. Why did I. Why did I want to mention Kai? All right. So he and I put together when. When. When Covid hit.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[11:51] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. Edcon was supposed to be in Vienna, right? And so that was all that was in 2019, and that was the year that I decided to open a parallel Nipolis in Vienna.

**[11:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right?

**[11:56] SPEAKER_01:** And I thought, okay, I'll do the launch during Ed Con.

**[11:58] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[11:59] SPEAKER_01:** And I've got all the Ethereum people, you know, here, and then I'll do a side event to announce the launch of Parallel Nipolis. Right, right. And then it was like, no, Chinese people can't come to Vienna.

**[12:05] SPEAKER_00:** Right? That's.

**[12:06] SPEAKER_01:** So they're like, okay, but we're still going to do Ed Con. Right? And then the full shutdown came. Yeah, but everybody had their tickets booked to edcon in Vienna, right? And so I was like, well, fuck it, I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do. This is before the total shutdown, like, okay, I'm gonna do Non Con.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:21] SPEAKER_01:** And so I booked a venue, and then came the full shutdown. And so I did a virtual conference. It was three days with four tracks with, I think 80 speakers. And Kai and I wrote a program called Inner Space. And Innerspace was an integrated online convention portal which had integrated Google Calendar and Jitsi video conferencing and integration with Discord and Telegram. Right. So that you had all of the. All of that in one portal. And we launched that with Non Con. Okay. And so that's all online. Non Con, under the parallel Nepalis Vienna.

**[12:40] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[12:41] SPEAKER_01:** Site. Yeah. So that was, you know, it just sort of, like, was obvious for me. Like, I. I'm interested in people who are. Who are building. Right. You know, I'm a true cypherpunk in that sense. You know, deploy the code, show me, do what is you're doing. And I've just been on the convention side, and that was. So my. This is where my involvement has been in Ethereum, that and. And community building. Right, right, right. And so through that, I got to meet pretty much, you know, like, everybody, you know, but Gavin Wood was the last one that I actually met personally.

**[13:00] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, right.

**[13:01] SPEAKER_01:** For the first time here in May. Came to Pizza Day. And so he's speaking here today.

**[13:05] SPEAKER_00:** He is speaking in 40 minutes.

**[13:07] SPEAKER_01:** In 40 minutes. Right. So, yeah. So. So tangentially, you know, get to meet a lot of the people. I also worked at. At Brainbot for the Trust Line Foundation.

**[13:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah, yeah. With.

**[13:17] SPEAKER_01:** With Heiko. Yeah, he's. And, you know, another early person. And that's. Yeah, Jacob was there and left us. Right.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[13:21] SPEAKER_01:** You know, so. But These, these core people. It's, it's. Yeah, yeah, it's so interesting. This whole thing for me is really wild because I never really came. Although there's an ideological underpinning and a natural, you know, do it yourself ethic that comes out of the punk or the hippie, you know, roots it is that I have out of California, where it is that we built the Internet, whatever. And I've always just been around, interested in the people and the, you know, the sympathetic people and the doers.

**[13:40] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yep.

**[13:41] SPEAKER_01:** And they're not necessarily the public faces that you see and everybody knows or that are loud in the space, you know, because that's a different part. I've just been like, around the devs, you know, the silent, you know, the silent underpinning, the silent foundation of what actually happens in the space. Right.

**[13:55] SPEAKER_00:** Has Ethereum become what you thought it might be? How much of the vision of what could happen there do you think has actually happened?

**[14:00] SPEAKER_01:** So I had two viewpoints, I think, that are common to early bitcoiners. Anything that can be built on another chain can eventually be deployed on Bitcoin, Right?

**[14:05] SPEAKER_00:** Yep. And very common early belief.

**[14:07] SPEAKER_01:** And, and so there is this also this sort of like move fast, break things, you know, sort of culture of Ethereum, which I really liked. And I was always a. And I always thought, yeah, cool. I'm really happy that all this stuff is happening on Ethereum. Like a sandbox, right?

**[14:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yep, Yep.

**[14:21] SPEAKER_01:** And not happening on Bitcoin.

**[14:23] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yep, yep.

**[14:24] SPEAKER_01:** So. So I mean, look at the, look at the ecosystem, you know, I think that one of the coolest things that Ethereum enabled was. Was crowdfunding, right? Yeah, just this completely alternative economy that created stocks, shareholders, you know what I mean? And it's in a completely new form that just was so direct.

**[14:40] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, right. Yep.

**[14:41] SPEAKER_01:** It's like amazing. The whole world should literally work like that. And I, so I love that aspect of Ethereum is that they. Is that they just did it.

**[14:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[14:46] SPEAKER_01:** That literally we issued. Created companies, created. Oh, there's no jurisdiction where we can register and do our stuff. It. We're going to build daos.

**[14:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yep.

**[14:51] SPEAKER_01:** You know what I mean? And. And so. So all of this fabulous permissionless stuff has happened on Ethereum that could not culturally happen on Bitcoin and may not ever actually happen on Bitcoin with the way that it's becoming part of the traditional finance.

**[15:05] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_01:** So another thing that I think is really interesting is seeing, seeing what's going on now with actually enterprise Ethereum and.

**[15:10] SPEAKER_00:** You were at the EA at the.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_01:** Beginning, which was super logical for me.

**[15:14] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Yep.

**[15:15] SPEAKER_01:** But it was too early because there wasn't really any clients. You were just doing educational work.

**[15:18] SPEAKER_00:** Pilots.

**[15:19] SPEAKER_01:** Pilots and whatever. But now we're actually there. So, I mean, you know, the promise of Ethereum, I think, is well, well, well exceeded its initial. Yeah, sort of, you know.

**[15:30] SPEAKER_00:** No, I mean, it is kind of mind blowing to see, you know, these huge, you know, financial companies, you know, saying, yep, you know, we're, we're building an L2 or we're building a, you know, an EVM one. Yep. So, you know, so literally the way.

**[15:45] SPEAKER_01:** That I got my first paid job at the Bitcoin Foundation.

**[15:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[15:48] SPEAKER_01:** Was John Matthews, who was the director of the Bitcoin foundation, went to. Came to Vienna to talk to bankers and diplomats.

**[15:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_01:** He's like, oh, Michael, so. And I just knew him from Twitter.

**[15:53] SPEAKER_00:** Yep.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_01:** And he's like, oh, I'm going to be in town. Right. Let's have a coffee. Right. And at that coffee, he said, hey, we listen, we need new branding and a new website for the Bitcoin Foundation. Do you think you can do that? Because there's a vote coming up and it's going to change and we thought these people are going to be do, and I agreed to do that. Right. But when he left Vienna, he went to Swift.

**[16:10] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[16:11] SPEAKER_01:** This is 2013.

**[16:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right, right.

**[16:14] SPEAKER_01:** So is Swift doing anything on bitcoin? No. Why is he not doing anything on Bitcoin? Because bitcoiners were too dumb to just go ahead and do it back then when add the scripting and composability and everything onto Bitcoin. And the way it is that all the L2s are now doing, all the L2s are a form of Ethereum. Right. So, you know, it's, it's quite wild, quite wild to see. And it's a, you know, huge circle for me just to see that announcement from Swift that they're doing an L2.

**[16:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. So Swift. Then you've got Stripe, you know, with Tempo, Stripe and Friends. Kind of looks like a bit of a Libra again, but, you know, same same kind of tech base. And then NASDAQ announced Robin Hood, you had as well.

**[16:45] SPEAKER_01:** So, I mean, I always, I always figure that it doesn't really matter where the chains are, who owns them and who controls them, whether they're, you know, degree of centralized or decentralized and whatever, because there's always going to be a bridge and if there's not a bridge, there's going to be a tokenized representation of it to trade on it. So this sort of idea of a borderless economy, the cat's out of the bag and everybody is catching up. And it's going to be interesting to see where it is that we're at in 10 years. I think that bitcoiners and Ethereums are going to be incredibly disappointed. But that's what happens when you percolate the tech into the world. You don't know what's actually going to be the end game, but the fact of the matter is that the tech revolution has happened.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

**[17:12] SPEAKER_01:** Most certainly.

**[17:14] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well, thanks so much. Great chatting to you. Great catching up with you as always. And all the very best.

**[17:20] SPEAKER_01:** I'll get you some archives for your site.

**[17:22] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. Yeah. Do pictures find goodies? You know, we love digital artifacts. You know, photos, links, you know, find that first tweet, memories, you know, I want to record everything I can.

**[17:35] SPEAKER_01:** And thank you so much, man, for being present in my life professionally and personally and in this amazing space, man. You're one of the top people in the space for me, man.

**[17:45] SPEAKER_00:** Well, thanks so much. All the very best. Bye.
