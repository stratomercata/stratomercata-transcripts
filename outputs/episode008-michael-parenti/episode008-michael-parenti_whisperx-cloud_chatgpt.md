**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So, welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Samuel here at Dark Prague with my good friend, exiled server, Michael Peranti.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Hello.

**[00:07] SPEAKER_01:** Hey, good to see you again, Bob.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_00:** Good to see you too. It's the first city we ever met.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right. DevCon 4, man.

**[00:12] SPEAKER_00:** Ah, yes, 2018. First hug that I got from you.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** There we are. You were competing with Griff for being the best hugger.

**[00:18] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Well, there we go. There we go. Yeah. So, I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since. But today, you know, really wanted to talk to you in terms of the early days of the Ethereum project and, you know, looking back to beginnings. So, I mean, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?

**[00:36] SPEAKER_00:** Before Ethereum evolved, I was at the Bitcoin Foundation, basically. So that was my place in the craziness of this space. I joined the Bitcoin Foundation just months before Mt. Gox collapsed. Yeah, that was a fun time. Right. And, you know, Mark Karpelès was one of the co-founders of the Bitcoin Foundation. MagicalTux. That was really funny. Yeah. And then Charlie Shrem getting arrested. Two of your directors getting arrested in short order is not really fantastic. So that was an interesting time. And so, I mean, in terms of Ethereum, Vitalik was on the scene very early as a Bitcoiner, right? And very active in the forums.

**[01:10] SPEAKER_01:** So young at the start, eh?

**[01:11] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Seventeen, I think, when it started. And then Bitcoin Magazine started, right? Together with him and Mihai Alisie started that up. And so Vitalik was on my radar just because he was present in the community. You know, there were so few of us at the time. It's stunning how few people there were at the beginning, and how present a lot of those people still are. And so I was following—we had blogs before social media.

**[01:36] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[01:37] SPEAKER_00:** Long-form writing. Who'd have thought? And so I still had my RSS feeds, and Vitalik had a blog. So he was in my RSS feeds, and one day he posted something about Ethereum. And so I was like, okay, cool.

**[01:50] SPEAKER_01:** Was it the white paper or did he do some posts? He was talking about the future of digital autonomous corporations and DAOs, right? And I forget what the exact title of the blog post was that announced Ethereum. I remember there was something that was like "ultimate scripting." Does that sound familiar? Because I know prior to getting to that sort of baked Ethereum vision, he had been doing work within Mastercoin, Colored Coins, and there were some of these pre-phases of how could you do different kinds of scripting and then an uncertainty of where that might land.

**[02:18] SPEAKER_00:** So that term doesn't really ring a bell with me. But anyway, he posted about Ethereum for the first time on his blog, and I tweeted that out. And so apparently I'm the first person that ever—

**[02:30] SPEAKER_01:** Tweeted about Ethereum as my claim to fame in the early Ethereum space.

**[02:33] SPEAKER_00:** Well, that's fantastic. We're going to have to dig out that tweet, aren't we, and then find the exact date on that, and then maybe the Internet Archive can find the blog post.

**[02:41] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, it's there. It's on Twitter.

**[02:43] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, I mean in terms of the actual link to the blog itself.

**[02:46] SPEAKER_01:** I think the link in the tweet is still valid.

**[02:48] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. Yeah, on Vitalik's blog. And funnily, when the NFT craze happened, there was this project called Cent, and you could turn a tweet into an NFT.

**[02:57] SPEAKER_01:** And that's C-E-N-T, right?

**[02:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, C-E-N-T. And I get this message, I get a DM from somebody, "Hey, if you mint this as a tweet, I'll buy it." And I was like, "How much do you want to buy it for?" And he's like, "I'll give you $200." And I was like, "For the first tweet of Ethereum? Yeah. No, but I guess I'll mint it, right?" And so I minted the tweet and ended up—so it's actually the second most expensive tweet behind Jack Dorsey's tweet.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_01:** I was going to say that. I remembered because Jack did his first, didn't he?

**[03:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Like his very first tweet. So those two tweets are the highest paid for a tweet. There you go. I minted it and some crackhead NFT trader in Dubai bought it off me for $21,000.

**[03:37] SPEAKER_01:** That's fantastic.

**[03:38] SPEAKER_00:** And so the guy that originally messaged me, I gave him 10% of that.

**[03:42] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, nice.

**[03:43] SPEAKER_00:** And he was in Argentina, and he was a schoolteacher. And he took that $2,100 and he turned it into an educational program for Ethereum in Argentina and turned it into a career. And like a year later, he wrote me back and he was like, "Wow, man, that was so cool that you did that. It totally changed my life. Now I'm teaching about Ethereum and I have a school class of children and I have all of these things and I'm living from being an Ethereum educator."

**[04:08] SPEAKER_01:** Right. Awesome. Awesome.

**[04:10] SPEAKER_00:** So that was the earliest time about Ethereum.

**[04:13] SPEAKER_01:** So it was probably November 2013, I'd have thought.

**[04:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. November 2013. I think that's exactly when it was.

**[04:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so Vitalik, I saw at various meetups. I think there was a yellow paper first, right? So the white paper, that was November, like you say. I guess there's some prior blogs before, right? Here's a fully formed white paper, which then he sent out to some random group of people.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_00:** And they passed it on to further people, and that was sort of how the beginning of the people getting together to start doing that happened. So I have another sort of interconnection. The first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smári McCarthy and Ásta Helgadóttir, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party.

**[04:58] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah.

**[04:59] SPEAKER_00:** And Smári McCarthy was one of the early WikiLeaks guys. And they were sitting in Jörg's bar in Berlin, Room 77, which is where the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening.

**[05:11] SPEAKER_01:** Okay.

**[05:12] SPEAKER_00:** And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol with crypto—with Bitcoin. And so Smári had tweeted that he was going to Jörg's bar, and I was like, okay, cool, I definitely got to buy you a whiskey. So we did this over Twitter, and I published the transaction on Twitter to see that it was confirmed. And I bought them whiskey in Jörg's bar. And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Paralelní Polis, right?

**[05:37] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah.

**[05:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right, okay. So the role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives a vibe of where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jörg used to do here. And so, yeah, there's an interesting connection. And so Room 77 is actually where Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally do Ethereum.

**[06:00] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_00:** Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir Taaki, who's also here in the house. And so this house is really interconnected for me with all of these people, this social nexus. Because Mike Gogulski, who was my partner in Bitcoin is Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin Foundation, was an original member of this house. And he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taaki. And also the one who introduced me to Lyn Ulbricht.

**[06:30] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah.

**[06:31] SPEAKER_00:** And he's the guy that started FreeRoss.org.

**[06:33] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[06:34] SPEAKER_00:** So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but to talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin.

**[06:40] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[06:41] SPEAKER_00:** Because it was an ICO on Bitcoin.

**[06:43] SPEAKER_01:** Right. And you were not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primary?

**[06:50] SPEAKER_00:** These people were coming through Vienna as well. So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have Metalab, which is the second earliest hackerspace after CCC in Europe. So there was Noisebridge in San Francisco and CCC and Metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at RIAT, R-I-A-T.at, from Matthias Tarasiewicz and Ralph. And they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally. Was at RIAT.

**[07:20] SPEAKER_01:** Right. There you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So the timeline on that is...
