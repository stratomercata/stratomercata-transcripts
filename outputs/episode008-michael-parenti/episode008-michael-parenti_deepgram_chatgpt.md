**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Samuel here at Dark Prague with my good friend, exiled server, Michael Parenti.

**[00:07] SPEAKER_01:** Hello. Hey. Good to see you again, Bob.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_00:** Good to see you too. It's the first place, first city we ever met.

**[00:12] SPEAKER_01:** Right. Right. DevCon 4, man.

**[00:14] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. 2018.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** First hug that I got from you. There we are. You were competing with Griff for being the best hug.

**[00:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Well, there we go.

**[00:21] SPEAKER_01:** There we go. Yeah. So, I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since. But today, you know, really wanted to talk to you in terms of the early days of the Ethereum project and, you know, looking back to the beginnings. So, I mean, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?

**[00:39] SPEAKER_01:** Before Ethereum involvement, I was at the Bitcoin Foundation. Basically. Yeah. So that was my place in the craziness of this space. I joined the Bitcoin Foundation just months before Mt. Gox collapsed.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. That was a fun time.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_01:** Right. And, you know, Mark Karpelès was one of the co-founders of the Bitcoin Foundation. MagicalTux. That was really funny. Yeah. And then Charlie Shrem getting arrested.

**[01:01] SPEAKER_00:** Two of your directors getting, you know, arrested in short order is not really fantastic.

**[01:05] SPEAKER_01:** So that was an interesting time. And so, I mean, in terms of Ethereum, Vitalik was on the scene, you know, very early as a Bitcoiner.

**[01:12] SPEAKER_00:** So active, young at the start.

**[01:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Seventeen, I think. And then Bitcoin Magazine started, right? Together with him and Mihai started that up. And so Vitalik was on my radar just because he was present in the community. You know, there were so few of us at the time. Right? It's like stunning how few people there were at the beginning, you know, and how present a lot of those people still are. Yeah. And so I was following, you know, we had blogs before social media, right?

**[01:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Long-form writing. Who'd have thought?

**[01:40] SPEAKER_01:** Long-form writing. And so I still had my RSS feeds and Vitalik had a blog. So he was in my RSS feeds and one day he posted something about Ethereum. And so I was like, okay, cool. You know?

**[01:51] SPEAKER_00:** Was that first thing—was it the white paper or did he—

**[01:53] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no. It was just some post. He was talking about the future of digital autonomous corporations and DAOs, right? And I forget what the exact title of the blog post was that announced—

**[02:03] SPEAKER_00:** I remember there was something that was like "Ultimate Scripting." Does that sound familiar? Because I know prior to getting to that sort of baked Ethereum vision, he had been doing work within Mastercoin, Colored Coins—

**[02:13] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[02:14] SPEAKER_00:** That there was, you know, some of these pre-phases of, well, how could you do different kinds of scripting, and then an uncertainty of where that might land. So that term doesn't really ring a—

**[02:23] SPEAKER_01:** Bell with me or whatever. But so anyway, he posted about Ethereum for the first time on his blog and I tweeted that out. And so apparently, I'm the first person that ever tweeted about Ethereum. That's my claim to fame in the early Ethereum space.

**[02:36] SPEAKER_00:** So we're gonna have to dig out that tweet, aren't we? And then find the exact date on that and then maybe—

**[02:41] SPEAKER_01:** The Internet Archive can find the blog. No, it's there. It's on—it's—

**[02:44] SPEAKER_00:** The original?

**[02:45] SPEAKER_01:** No, no. Still, it's on Twitter.

**[02:47] SPEAKER_00:** No, no. I mean the actual link to the blog.

**[02:49] SPEAKER_01:** I think the link in the tweet is still valid.

**[02:51] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[02:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. On Vitalik's blog. And finally, when the NFT craze happened, there was this project called Cent, and they—you know, you could turn a tweet into an NFT.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_00:** And that's C-E-N-T, right?

**[03:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. C-E-N-T. I get this message. I get a DM from somebody, "Hey, you know, if you mint this as a tweet, I'll buy it." You know? And I was like, "How much do you want to buy it for?" And he's like, "I'll give you $200." And I was like, "For the first tweet of Ethereum? Nah, but I guess I'll mint it." Right? You know? And so I minted the tweet and ended up—so it's actually the second most expensive tweet behind Jack Dorsey's tweet.

**[03:27] SPEAKER_00:** I was gonna say that. I remembered because Jack did his first, didn't he?

**[03:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Like his very first tweet. Yeah. So those two tweets are the highest, you know, paid for—for a tweet. There you go. And so I minted it and some crackhead NFT trader in Dubai bought it off me for $21,000.

**[03:45] SPEAKER_00:** That's fantastic.

**[03:46] SPEAKER_01:** And so the guy that originally messaged me, I gave him 10% of that.

**[03:50] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, nice.

**[03:51] SPEAKER_01:** And he was in Argentina and he was a school teacher.

**[03:54] SPEAKER_00:** Wow.

**[03:55] SPEAKER_01:** And he took that $2,100 and he turned it into an educational program for Ethereum in Argentina. Like turned it into a career. Like a year later, he brought me back and he was like, "Wow, man, that was so cool that you did that and it totally changed my life. Now I'm teaching about Ethereum and I have school classes with children, I have all of these things, and I'm living from being an Ethereum educator."

**[04:17] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Awesome. Awesome.

**[04:19] SPEAKER_01:** So that was the earliest time about Ethereum.

**[04:22] SPEAKER_00:** So it's probably November 2013, I'd have thought.

**[04:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. November 2013. Yeah. Around that. I think that's exactly when it was. And yeah, so, you know, Vitalik I saw at various meetups when he—you know, I think there was a yellow paper first, right?

**[04:36] SPEAKER_00:** Well, so yeah. So the white paper—that was November, like you say. I guess there's some prior blogs before. Right, here's a fully formed white paper, which then he sent out to some random group of people, and they passed it on to further people, and that was sort of like how the beginning of that—the people getting together to start doing that—happened.

**[04:54] SPEAKER_01:** So I have like another sort of interconnection. The first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smári McCarthy and Ásta Helgadóttir, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party.

**[05:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[05:09] SPEAKER_01:** And Smári McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys.

**[05:12] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Okay.

**[05:13] SPEAKER_01:** And they were sitting in Jörg Platzer's bar in Berlin, Room 77, which is where the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening.

**[05:20] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. Okay.

**[05:21] SPEAKER_01:** And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol with crypto.

**[05:24] SPEAKER_00:** Right. With Bitcoin.

**[05:25] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. And so Smári had tweeted that he was going to Jörg's bar and I was like, okay, cool. I've definitely gotta buy you a whiskey. So we did this over Twitter and I published the transaction on Twitter to see that it was confirmed and I bought them whiskey in Jörg's. And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Paralelní Polis.

**[05:44] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah. Right. Okay.

**[05:46] SPEAKER_01:** The role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives like a vibe of where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what he used to do here. And so, yeah, there's like an interesting connection. And so Room 77 is actually where it is that Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally actually do Ethereum.

**[06:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_01:** Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir, who's also here in the house. So like this house is really interconnected for me with all of these people, this social nexus.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[06:17] SPEAKER_01:** Because Michael Gualtieri, who was my partner in Bitcoin is Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin Foundation, was an original member of this house. And he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taaki and also the one who introduced me to Lyn Ulbricht.

**[06:35] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**[06:36] SPEAKER_01:** Right. He's the guy that started freeross.org.

**[06:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right.
