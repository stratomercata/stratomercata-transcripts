**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today.
We are talking about the future of art and NFTs.
And we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain.
Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Hey, Victor.
Hey, everyone.
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, sure.
So yeah, my crypto journey started around 2015, going to the Consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call.
Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
I worked in advertising.
I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
And so yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art, so I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
Obviously we met there, but like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, well, I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
I had actually met, I think, John Lilic, which I forgot, but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center.
I don't know if you guys remember that.
Yeah, so I was hanging around and actually I was super into Counterparty.
So I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated.
You know, Vitalik's full of shit, it's not going to work.
And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong.
Like, this is actually super cool.
I have no problem changing.
I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing.
And I was just Googling Ethereum, blockchain, hackathon.
I was trying to get deeper involved.
I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
And so then I think I just Googled it and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
And I applied with Charles and then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
And to be clear, to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project and we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Exactly.
I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, well, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys—

**SPEAKER_02:**
There was like a couple week consulting transition period while, you know—

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, I think that's true.
Maybe it was like we started hourly, like getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time.

**SPEAKER_03:**
So with Counterparty, you could have been on Chris DeRose Tech.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So what inspired SuperRare?
Like, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there—and watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens.
I found it super interesting that this very small bit of standard—super simple protocol, very simple code—but the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
It was incredible to see that happen.
And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
It could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
I didn't know exactly what the business model was going to look like, but the total addressable market's probably pretty large.
So that got me into NFTs.
And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene—going to the art fairs.
I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
And it just seemed obvious.
I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets.
And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion?
Because I know for a long time you were building and it was like, how's it going?
And no one was really paying attention.
And all of a sudden, next day everyone's talking about it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It was absolutely crazy.
It was hard. It was just completely surreal the whole time.
It felt like a dream.
We started in 2018.
We tried to raise money. It never really worked.
By the time we raised, we were already cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So that's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
So yeah, it was a grind.
It was super volatile.
Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
But then it just really started.
I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while.
October 2020 was our first million-dollar month in volume.
And I was just like, this is wild.
Twelve months ago, the volume was like $5,000 and we made a couple hundred bucks.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?
I think we were trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience.
There were maybe a couple other minting tools, but we were the first to combine both.
There weren't great minting tools then, so we started with the minting tool and then we were like, alright, I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll build the marketplace too.
It was partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.
