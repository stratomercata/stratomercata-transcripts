SPEAKER_00: We are live. Are we live? We are live. Yes, so StreamYard says.

SPEAKER_01: My browser window doesn't say live.

SPEAKER_02: You guys have an intro you like to do?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, first, here we go. Here we go. Yeah, there we are. Go ahead, Bob.

SPEAKER_01: So hello, everybody. I guess we're ready to go. So today, we have a special guest with us. It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here as an ex-Blockappser.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, remember crypto. You are never an ex-Blockappser. You're always part of team Blockapps, the alumni network. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which it feels like ages ago. And I mean, it is ages ago, a lifetime. Yeah, so thank you guys for that. Happy to be on here. It's always great seeing you guys around and talking about one of my favorite topics.

SPEAKER_01: Welcome. So yeah, so welcome back. Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure, about that. So Brian Smokovich, bsmokes.eth on Twitter. We're building PistachioFi. It's a mobile first neobank built entirely on crypto rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security and the whole concept of better UX. Right? I will get to the question in the moment of is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think self custody is really important to me and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. Right? And so I just wanted to be the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it and build my own. You know, basically, taught myself UI design in order to begin this in the beginning and then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence and many, many, many, many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more people on chain.

SPEAKER_01: I see that you, the number you said was 18 versions in five months.

SPEAKER_02: Oh, we've pushed out several beyond since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So yeah, we ship a lot. We ship and it's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong. I'll stand, I'll be at a conference and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and watch every little tap. Right, oh, the focus is wrong, the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this certain instance or the search is showing the wrong things. And so every little, but that's the thing about UX is you design something and then you build it. Right? And then it's of course, it's gonna be bugged. Everything is always bugged. Right? And we go through rigorous testing to do it. But then when it goes on to somebody's very specific use case because they touch certain things in a certain way and that's what triggered this one bug or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone, it behaves in a certain way. And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there. Right? They're gonna press it. They're gonna press it, and then they don't press it. And you're like, why? Why did they not press the very clear call to action that I made? And so it's just the only real way, you can track things through things like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer to see the UX flows, but you're gonna miss all the little details of every single user interaction. And so just being able to watch and categorize that and implement that is a big portion of what I think makes our app more successful.

SPEAKER_03: Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So if you think about fintech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improved the UX on the legacy financial system. It looks way better. It works. It's not nearly as much of a mess as the Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the best example. But, you know, I think so maybe that's the baseline expectation. But is it the totality of UX? Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And, you know, so what is your take? My understanding, I think you guys are multichain, but inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too. You know? So what, how do you think about that?

SPEAKER_02: There's a lot to fix. I think you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of fintech generational UX UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI, and that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. The UI of Venmo is sort of even almost antiquated in a way, but the UX has done beautifully. And that reason is because they approach it from, instead of a feature, it's just a user problem. What is the user problem? It's sending money. Right? You open the app. It's got this big send button, and it's just so simple than just a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is. Right? And so with web three UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with traditional finance and fintech. And that's, so when it comes to web three, for example, and especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay, we have gas we have to worry about. We have token approvals we have to worry about. We have multichain which we have to worry about. We have bundled transactions if there's multiple transactions. Right? And so, luckily, all of these things are now, there are solutions for these. Right? Between EIP-4337 and EIP-7702, there are ways to implement paymasters. There are ways to bundle transactions together. There's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. We do all of this. Right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that we don't do, for example, is within web three gaming, there's this concept of session keys. And it's like, oh, okay. If I'm gonna have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that gets written to the blockchain? It's like, no. You just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in. Basically, as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your gaming session. Right? And so that basically absolves away or abstracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that it takes for a web three company again to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to solve it all. It's just a matter of does the app creator understand all of these things? Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things? Right? Some of the major apps or wallets even, I love, I'm a big Rabby user. They still don't have 7702 implemented. Right? And so there's a lot of these big players that still don't have these available UX implementations, live and integrated into their apps.

SPEAKER_00: I'm curious, Brian, because, you know, just to review some of the background. Right? When you were working for us, you were a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX and product design? I'm glad, you know, you've joined the dark side. But it's like, what got you there and what made you feel like, okay. This is something I can take on?

SPEAKER_02: Well, I've always honestly really loved the product side. I think I had a natural ability to be a salesperson. I love to just chat and create rapport, and I think that's very important for sales and marketing. But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for, I think it was more of just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's the natural calling. Right? When you find something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly, I'm spending twelve to fifteen hour days working a website or whatever it is. Right? Just because I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it. So when I was learning UX UI, it was some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing, and I'm sure Kieran can, or I mean, I think all of you guys can relate to this is that once it's yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just working for someone. When you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay. I get equity options and this and a paycheck, and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having being aligned of, okay, if I kill this, I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it and it's my baby. Right? So I think that sort of shines a lot in being a founder and growing your own application. And then it's just, I have an obsession with it, to be honest. I have an obsession of talking to users and understanding what makes it better and just the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over. Right? And so I think all of that has just aggregated to and led me to where I am today.

SPEAKER_00: And yeah. I mean, we, one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten a chance to work with some great people, and we could always see that you have that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out in this. I think one, though, challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong, or I don't understand this. That seems to be a big hurdle that, you know, a lot of truly technical people just can't get over sometimes.

SPEAKER_02: And it comes down to which I think maybe makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as well, is that I say UX is just empathy just brought to life. Because at the end of the day, it's you very, very much need to just be able to put yourself in your user's shoes and to empathize with, oh, okay. This isn't good enough because they're being frustrated, which should frustrate you. Right? If it's gonna piss them off, it should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because if you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that ability to also be frustrated, then you're not gonna care enough to fix it. Right? It's like, you should be pissed. If a user is gonna be pissed, you should be pissed.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I agree 100%.

SPEAKER_03: Who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean, you know, there's full on normies. There's crypto natives. But the, you know, I have some interest in age ranges and all that sort of thing because I think maybe both of us, but, you know, it's hard to define exactly the bucket. They probably are crypto friendly, but maybe, you know? Anyway.

SPEAKER_02: We will be, we are normie friendly. If you want to invite your siblings and family, I want it to be friendly enough that you can invite these people without fear of throwing them to the wolves of volatility, of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls, all these things. And so it's designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user, my ideal customer is probably between the ages of 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on chain, that want to be able to not need to offboard crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high quality self custodial, high security, but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values security, but that also values privacy and that has the ability then to not let their funds, if they're going to risk off into stables, for example, be able to easily earn safe, curated, high quality yield that is at least double of what is US treasuries without being exposed to equities and then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of through just talking to a lot of people seems to be the very bread and butter of people that I think would work very well of customer user base of people who can at least put five figures into my app, preferably at least $50,000 into the six figures that would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our users to trust that as well. But also if you wanna invite your friends, your family to make it easy just on chain, this is the easiest way. Right?

SPEAKER_00: So why do you think the UX has been so bad in web three for so long?

SPEAKER_02: I think it's a large disconnect of people building and people talking to users, especially a lot of, I talk to a lot of founders. I love to talk to founders. I meet so many, one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just sort of in that natural BD aspect is just I meet so many people and about what they're building. And very frequently, I'm asked to basically audit people's UX, UIs, just give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people wanna build an MVP. They wanna build fast. They wanna build something. It's a hard chicken and the egg problem of how do I talk to users if I don't have anything for them to use? Right? If I don't have an MVP, if I don't have these, and so people then build in this direction of, okay, well, I'm just gonna build a product, and then I'm gonna get users. Right? And so, realistically, what they wanna do is they should be building the product, but as you're building it, you wanna talk to potential users. You wanna talk to people who you think this problem is solving. Right? Because you shouldn't just be building an app or a feature set. Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so when you're building to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like or people, I mean, first of your friends because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like, do any of you have this problem. Find friends who may have this problem. If you don't, it's not necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people who have this problem, eventually, you're not solving a problem. Right? You're creating a solution in search of a problem instead of actually finding people who would be willing to test out what you're doing and then show them the earliest iterations. Right? And so figuring out that of, is this confusing? Is this good? Is this bad? Is this really actually solving the core problem that we set out to solve at the end of the day? Luckily, I think a lot of builders these days set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their earlier careers or usages, right, of that, let's say you work in a B2B company or you're creating a, maybe you're a founder for a company. You're like, dude, this is such a pain in my butt. Right? That you're this one particular thing, they go on to create a company that goes to solve that problem. Right? They're dog fooding their own pain. Same thing with B2C and kind of, I love to use crypto and be on chain and love all of these different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me to where I am with creating what I would like. Right? Because I would dog food all of these apps essentially and just be like, okay, well, this isn't good enough. This isn't good enough. And so I think that that's sort of the main reason that creators or app builders, I think they maybe try to create something for maybe to be cool or to add a vanity even or potentially to chase the trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money is going. Right? People are chasing perps right now. How many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to go and go out and get money. Also, because people for better or for worse, you know, they try to chase that trend because they see where the VC money is flowing to. And they say, oh, if I can get on that VC train, then I can get the money to build this. Right? And chase that trend, then maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. And so there's all these, they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the core of what problem do I wanna solve.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, my kind of theory in one of the challenges web three has had is that, you know, in the first phase of web three, really, we're just trying to solve technical problems. Right? Make it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to an extent. And then but those people that can solve those super hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can think from a user perspective, really. Right? They're thinking more about, okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has kind of happened. And, you know, I think you've caught it at the right time. I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way towards design, more hybrid engineers who have that back end, front, I mean, just full stack. Right? Who then are now also intrigued in design and this because maybe they built their own thing from scratch, and they were forced to, right, as opposed to just a straight up back end engineer who's doing these things.

SPEAKER_03: One thing I'll say, I now code again occasionally because the AI has gotten so good. And if it has a template, it's not so good at UX from scratch. But if it has something to work from, I'm like, no, just generate a component like this and do this. It usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be in the past. And I found with my web two startups and my mobile startups that, you know, I was CTO of the first startups. And then I switched to product because I realized that, like, hey, by turning step three into step one, I could 10x the usage overnight. Right? So it's like that but it's a totally different mode of thinking than, oh, how am I gonna get the code out the door and get all of those things?

SPEAKER_02: Also, the infrastructure really didn't exist for a while. I remember vividly one time we were at the Blockapps office, and Vic, you said in the office, mobile web three sucks. I just remember I don't even remember the day. I just remember you going on about it, and it was true for such a long period of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring web three to mobile didn't exist for the longest time. And this last bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure. It's still not good enough, but that's fine. It's always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't exist back then or even just libraries, right, of people being, of having SDKs that are compatible with React Native or just native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate because we need that. We can't build everything from scratch, dude. As much as I would love to have everything in house, especially being a mostly bootstrapped company, is we need people to have proper, they need to have good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.

SPEAKER_00: I yeah. I kind of remember that conversation. I think one of my frustrations at the time was talking to some of the devs, and they were like, yeah. We have a mobile solution. We're gonna run a node on your phone. And I was like, do you know, battery life is important to me. I never know, lasted the day.

SPEAKER_01: That's where I started. Remember? Yes. You tried to run it on a watch, man. When I got the smartwatch, that was my first project. Was seeing if I could get cpp-ethereum running on a smartwatch. And I didn't get that, but Geth worked. Geth worked on a smartwatch, and it was because it was so early, right, that the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about workable. And now the thought at the time, well, you know, yeah, we're gonna have a light client thing. There isn't yet, but, you know, we'll get that going. And same with on the desktop. Right? We missed, missed having embedded. Yeah, it was just a thought that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit slow, but, you know, we'll optimize it. It will get 10x. It'll get a 100x.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. None of those people have ever built a mobile app before. Obviously. You're gonna have this stuff, it will just run inside every router. It will just be an OS level sort of service.

SPEAKER_02: Dude, building a mobile app sucks. It's hard. Oh, man. It's really hard, especially by Apple. That's a nightmare. That I think that was the easy part, dude. That was, I'm not gonna, it's like that's hard, but that was the easy part. It's like building a web three app that's multichain on multiple operating systems is just the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare. That's been the hardest part. Our last, we launched in June or May, June. And then literally all summer was us just hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over the edge cases.

SPEAKER_01: And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.

SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Publicly, at least. You know, we've been, I'm a big soft launch guy. If you can, we're always probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah, so Android took a while, months longer than Apple because it's much easier to develop on Apple. Right? It's like everything's standardized. Everything just works across every single device. On Android, it's like, okay, you have to worry about basically, you have to worry about optimizations going back far enough to Android 12 to cover 90% of use cases. 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd. And then if you're doing that, you also have to worry about hardware optimizations, right, to make sure that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on very base level Android devices, right, because they cost very low. And most of the world has a lot of these really cheap devices. Okay. So you can't load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the amount of different screen types and getting the edge to edge display to work via React Native Expo was also not working very well. And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use React Native Expo. Maybe they have native to each device. And so there's not even good libraries that help on Expo for this. Expo just launched edge to edge display two months ago. These things still aren't very public, and so my CTO even wants to launch a library, a publicly available repo just to help with all of these hardships that we had to go through firsthand, essentially.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I remember, you know, in my last company, it was a mobile company. To make sure things ran on iOS, we ran it on two devices in the simulator. We had a table of Android devices and just to kind of test all the configurations.

SPEAKER_01: But the fact there's probably, I don't know, 10,000, more than 10,000 different devices. Yeah, sure.

SPEAKER_00: I got a couple over here too. But, you know, TVs and tablets and whatever. Right? They're all different in their own way. I'm really curious. You know, when you made that evolution to a founder as you were talking about before, what was the biggest challenge that you faced, do you think?

SPEAKER_02: The biggest challenge, it evolves over time. Right? As I level up as a founder, the challenges get bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision. It's like I have this vision in my head, and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so that's why I learned UX UI design was so I can literally just put it into a Figma and show someone and be like, this is what I want. Right? This is how I foresee it. And so that was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO on board because he's like, I love this idea. Let's do it. So then we did that. And then the next challenge was the architecture. Right? And so then the architectural solution of vendor selection, which I was talking to someone early today about this, vendor selection's a nightmare. I luckily already knew what chain I wanted to work on and how I wanted to be multichain, so that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be a robust multichain application, this is pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use account abstraction and smart accounts. Very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era. And so the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited. And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about key storage and how do we do recovery and how do we keep people safe. And these are all the different vendors. For every different, there's a different decision for a different vendor at each part of the stack and being able to basically understand web three deep enough to understand the trade offs of each different vendor and what they bring and okay, well, what's the price? Because we're unfunded. Right? So I have to make sure it works within my realm of my budget while also being able to make sure it's scalable in the long term if we do go into this thing. And then how do we do, do we do things to be modular? Do we do things to go purely vertical stack? Does that lock us in as a vendor? Do we wanna be more modular? And then we've had opportunity, we've had moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performing enough. They're not elite enough. You know? And so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us back in delivery time. Right? So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as literally a two person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full time engineer last month, but it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time. And thank god that I understand blockchain architecture as deeply as I do or my CTO would have, it would have been all of this would have been on him, and it made it much easier being able to share that experience.

SPEAKER_00: That's awesome. But, yeah, it's as you say, every step, there's a new challenge. But, you know, I think it's also just keeping excited. You work really, really hard as we can see. So I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project and just in general.

SPEAKER_02: Thank you.

SPEAKER_00: So yeah. So yeah. I'm just looking at the time, Brian. So let me just ask you one last question perhaps.

SPEAKER_01: When are we ready for the normies?

SPEAKER_02: We're already ready for the normies. At least Pistachio is. Right? We made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You don't have to worry about seed phrases. You don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen. Right? We can recover everything in programmatic ways and secure ways as well that's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so but at least the next wave of updates that we're gonna be doing is gonna be really cool too. I think the alpha is the ability to send bank transfers from an on chain account to specific accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. So stuff like that is gonna be really cool because that solves real pain. Right? It's this idea of going back to before, literally what I've been talking about. Crypto and even to tie it all in for the is better web three UX the key to mainstream adoption? And I don't think it is. Right? It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption. Right? It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big, but there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if my ability to send an on chain transaction and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a SPEI transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, that's significant pain being solved because most common applications right now that do it are, let's say, like Dollar App or Felix, and they do it for a $3 flat fee, which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone, if you only wanna send it in small amounts. Right? It's like $100. That's a 3% fee that's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with no limits, no caps. You can send $50,000 for a dollar if you wanna do it with banking rails or if you wanna just keep it on chain and keep it in Pistachio. Right? It's free, unlimited as we all know how you can send money in crypto land. Right? You can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents. And on Pistachio, all the peer to peer transactions are free. So I think we're ready for normies right now, but it's just about increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains, painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it.

SPEAKER_03: Good note. Okay. Well, thank you very much.

SPEAKER_02: Thank you guys for having me. Yeah, good to see you, Kieran. I know you gotta run.

SPEAKER_00: Hope to, at least some of us will be at some of the international events. Maybe we can catch up there.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, perfect. Please. If you guys are gonna be at Ethereum LATAM in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them.

SPEAKER_00: Cool. We would definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person, man. And I wanna see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, absolutely. Will do.

SPEAKER_00: Take care. Thanks so much.

SPEAKER_02: Thanks. It's great to meet you, Bob.

SPEAKER_01: You too. Cheers. Bye bye.
