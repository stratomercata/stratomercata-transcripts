**SPEAKER_01:**
[35.5s] Welcome, guys.
[36.3s] Welcome, welcome.
[37.8s] Just waiting for Fabian to get on here.
[43.1s] Let me know if you guys have any questions or want to come up and be a part of the panel.
[65.9s] Trying to play some music, but it ain't playing.
[97.8s] Oh, there he is.
[100.6s] Okay.
[114.5s] Hi Fabian, how are you?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[119.8s] Hello.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[123.3s] How you doing?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[125.9s] Good.
[127.3s] I mean, good under the circumstances.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[132.9s] Yeah, there's always interesting stuff going on in this space.
[137.2s] It's good to finally meet you.
[139.3s] I tried to actually come to the booth in East Denver, and I just missed you.
[145.3s] I actually met a brew, I think a brew.
[150.6s] Very nice lady.
[151.6s] And, uh, I kept calling you Fabian, Fabian, Fabian.
[156.5s] She's like, that's not how you say his name.
[160.9s] It's Fabian.
[161.8s] It's Fabian.
[162.6s] I was like, uh, I'm just an American.
[164.5s] Sorry.
[166.1s] But, um, yeah, it's great.
[167.7s] It's great.
[168.4s] Um, to finally link up and talk a bit about just you and the past and in a little bit of the future, I got a bunch of, uh,
[177.9s] questions about, you know, you in general and then, uh, you know, the early days of Ethereum.
[184.5s] And then we'll probably wrap up with a nice chunk of, you know, what you're doing now with, with Luxo and, and you, the universal profiles, if that, if that's all cool with you.
[196.2s] Sure.
[196.4s] Yeah.
[198.1s] So really, I just wanted to just kind of get an idea of like, when did you actually start developing and when, and like how and why you got into blockchain?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[209.9s] Yeah.
[211.2s] Um, I mean, I started developing when I was quite young.
[215.6s] So I started with like with seven at my first computer, we got my father's old computer was, I think it was a two 86, uh, PC.
[229.3s] And, um, I mean, I was basically always more interested in making the games work, you know, in the past you had to configure the conflict system, the out exit, but to get games running,
[238.7s] And that was always interesting.
[240.2s] And then once I had it running, I played it for five minutes, and I was bored.
[243.6s] And then I went on to get the next game running.
[249.0s] Yeah, and then.
[250.8s] I mean, I've basically been, you know, web designing since pretty much 14.
[256.3s] I mean, I started with the first websites that I created for, you know, some people in my village, they had the company and in the 90s, they all wanted to, you know, I mean, they realized they have to have a website now, blah, blah, blah.
[269.1s] And then they heard that I could make websites.
[271.7s] And then that's how I started.
[274.6s] over my early kind of web developer career, I just made a lot of websites.
[280.1s] And I built a content management system, which is my username, in fact.
[285.1s] So if you go to findura.org, you actually still find my content management system that I built in the 2000, I think 2005 to 2008.
[295.1s] That's kind of how I got like all into coding.
[301.2s] There was always like my private
[303.2s] life and my hobby.
[304.3s] And I studied media design, funny enough, that was not coding.
[311.5s] That was basically everything else from, you know, movie making to audio to graphic design and whatnot.
[321.5s] Yeah.
[321.9s] So this is how I got into, you know, decoding itself.
[325.1s] And in 2013, I heard about Bitcoin through one of these, you know, random posts that you see on a website where it says, you know, every, every time these like mixy media posts you see on websites where you think this is total scam, it said something about a Canadian wants to sell house in Bitcoin.
[344.8s] And then I thought, okay, what is Bitcoin?
[346.2s] If somebody wants to sell his house in something I've never heard, let me click on that.
[351.5s] So that was March 2013, and that was the beginning of the rabbit hole of blockchain for me.
[357.5s] So basically, I literally realized, okay, that's kind of like a crazy idea, like a cryptographic money.
[365.2s] It's decentralized, and all of this was completely novel concepts at the time.
[369.2s] And I just kind of instantly got a feeling that this was a very big deal.
[374.6s] And then over the year 2013,
[378.7s] I kind of like really tried to conceptually understand how Bitcoin works.
[384.7s] And, you know, that concept was quite novel in terms of decentralized infrastructure.
[390.4s] I mean, I already built websites and I knew how servers run and how everything else works on the computer.
[395.3s] But you always had to have a central place where, you know, logic is processed.
[401.4s] And it's either it's a computer or it's a server or something needs to decide how this stuff
[406.9s] has to work.
[408.3s] And here the idea was that you have this like distributed computer network and somehow they agree to what the system does.
[416.2s] And it took me quite a while actually to, I mean, within the year 2013, I really thought every month that I kind of understood it now.
[425.3s] And I had always these revelation moments where I thought, ah, this is, ah, that's, that's how it works.
[429.9s] But I had this like probably 12 times in this year.
[432.8s] And every time again, I felt like, and now I get it.
[438.1s] But yeah, I mean, I already felt like this was a big deal.
[441.9s] So I kind of took my little extra 200 euros a month that I had and put them in Bitcoin, you know, just because I knew this would be big.
[454.3s] I mean, this was, you know, 2013.
[456.3s] And when I joined, it was March.
[458.4s] Um, literally the month later, it went from $10 to $260 only to go back to 60 over the next three months, then only to go back to 1,200.
[469.2s] So it was kind of like a, a compressed version of the bubbles of today.
[473.0s] It was the exact same kind of flow, except that it was highly compressed.
[478.8s] Um,
[480.0s] because everything happened in pretty much just a year, you know, from up down to down up.
[487.7s] Yeah, this was kind of like in the pre-Ethereum world, you know, and there was pretty much, you know, when I joined, it was March and in July, I think two months later, came the first kind of Bitcoin clones because people realized, oh, wow, you know, I can also make Bitcoin.
[509.3s] fork that, give it a different name, maybe change a little bit of things.
[513.2s] And that was Litecoin.
[515.6s] And then people started to, you know, clone Bitcoin.
[518.8s] And some were actually a bit more creative, there was a project called NXP.
[523.5s] That was, you know, a little bit like a mini version of Ethereum, it had like a lot of different kind of functionality, you could create a colored coin, you know, assets, or how they called it, like the tokens of today, you could even trade them all on the same blockchain.
[538.5s] And they did all of this through a different kind of transactions type that they introduced into their Proof-of-Stake network.
[546.6s] And they also had a quite sophisticated interface.
[548.6s] So this was kind of interesting to see.
[550.5s] And all of this pretty much happened within months, by the way, at the time.
[555.6s] And then in, I think it was 2014,
[564.0s] Was it 2014?
[565.4s] No, 2013.
[565.9s] Yeah, I think it was in 2013 already that Mastercoin came up with the idea of instead of creating a new blockchain, they could just encode, you know, new types of kind of protocol inside the Bitcoin blockchain.
[580.5s] And then you could create colored coins on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.
[585.8s] And I think that's also the idea, like this is also what inspired Vitalik then to create Ethereum.
[591.7s] And I found Mastercoin quite interesting from a concept point of view.
[597.3s] And then end of 2013, Metallic proposed the Ethereum white paper.
[603.6s] And I mean, I heard of it.
[606.8s] I kind of felt it was really a novel idea.
[610.9s] It sounded kind of like a bit complicated to make a whole virtual machine running on a blockchain.
[619.1s] but it sounded like a big idea.
[623.2s] So yeah, I followed that.
[625.4s] And basically in 2014, shortly before they made their ICO, I met the guys from Ethereum here in Berlin at like a coworking space opening.
[640.0s] And I kind of realized that what they wanted to do was a really cool idea, but they had no one who could build
[649.4s] the applications, the idea was kind of like we make the network and we build the, you know, we build the network and then the rest of the people come by themselves.
[660.8s] And I wrote a book about Meteor.js, which is a JavaScript framework that allowed you to build single page applications.
[670.1s] And I just really felt that was the perfect fit here because you could build a JavaScript application that purely runs on your front end.
[677.2s] and then it could basically talk to this blockchain as the backend.
[681.1s] So, through some funny hoops, I actually joined Ethereum in 2015, in January.
[690.7s] Actually, Alex was the one who hired me.
[694.0s] Alex saw a message in the Skype channel because I reached out to Aaron from the foundation.
[702.2s] Alex wanted to build this Mist Browser concept.
[705.5s] He was the UX designer and he came up with this whole Mist Browser idea and he made this video that you can still find on YouTube where he explained the whole idea of like a purposeful browser with applications where you could have your savings account and your friends and the DAO and funding and whatever not in there.
[727.9s] But he was not really
[729.3s] able to fully pull it off by himself.
[731.0s] And then he saw, hey, there's this guy who can build full stack applications, and he's interested.
[736.3s] And then he kind of like vouched to Jeffrey that they should hire me.
[743.0s] And Jeffrey Wilke, he was the lead for the Go Ethereum client.
[748.5s] And now it's Peter.
[749.4s] Back in the day, it was Jeffrey.
[751.1s] He's the one who basically built the Go Ethereum client.
[755.8s] He basically thought, okay, yeah, let's try him out.
[760.1s] So they threw me this crazy complex task.
[763.4s] They said, like, build a chat application based on the Whisper protocol.
[768.4s] So I don't know if you guys know, but one of the early protocols next to Ethereum that kind of like they were working on was Whisper.
[775.9s] And Whisper was a messaging protocol.
[779.1s] The idea was it was a messaging protocol for whistleblowers.
[782.7s] So you could basically send a message into the network,
[785.8s] And nobody could know where it came from.
[789.3s] So you could obviously sign your messages, which was anonymous, but you couldn't trace it back to an AP or so.
[795.1s] And the idea was, hey, build a front end for that, build like a front end for a chat app.
[799.1s] And that's what I did.
[801.0s] So I built basically within a month and a half, like a full working chat app that kind of used the Whisper protocol.
[808.3s] And that kind of like impressed Jeffrey, I think.
[811.3s] And
[812.6s] Yeah, that even had topics, by the way, which even within the channel, you could like filter message based on topics, which is something like we use like today in Discord with threads.
[824.8s] I had this idea to make it a bit more orderly if people chat and people want to talk about some subtopic in the same channel.
[833.1s] Yeah, I mean, it was working, you know, and then kind of like we, this was my kind of into Ethereum in a short

**SPEAKER_01:**
[842.4s] Yeah, no, that was you definitely answered a bunch of my questions that I had but um that yeah that that is uh, that is really interesting how How you got involved?
[856.8s] so Was it like did you actually think a theorem was gonna be as big as it was or were you just kind of getting?
[864.6s] into it because you were interested in especially with something like
[869.5s] solidity, like how was, how was it coding with solidity when there was such little infrastructure to help?
[878.1s] It was so new and different at the time.
[880.1s] You guys basically paved the way.
[882.6s] Like, was there a lot of issues and, you know, could you elaborate on some of those issues?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[889.7s] I mean, uh, I mean, there was totally nothing really.
[894.0s] I mean, the language was literally, I mean, the EVM was pretty much just like built in its early form.
[901.8s] The network was not live yet because, you know, in January, I mean, the network started in July.
[906.5s] There was pretty much no documentation, really.
[910.2s] So when I came in, there was the RPC endpoints.
[914.2s] This is kind of like, you know, your node provides these RPC endpoints, which is the API that
[920.0s] then an app can call.
[922.2s] And a few of them are very important, for example, sendTransaction, obviously, to send a transaction.
[928.0s] And the thing was a bit a mess.
[930.9s] I mean, there were some things were encoded in hex and others were not, and the naming was completely unclear.
[936.0s] um there was for example a function called count at you know which never anybody could guess what it means and i figured out oh this is how you count the transaction at a certain address to get the nonce so basically my first kind of little battle was with gavin to convince him to that we can change the api um and so i came in like kind of cleaned up the api and there was a bit of a
[959.1s] back and forth.
[959.8s] And I had this very funny constellation that I was actually hired by GoEthereum by Jeffrey Wilkes team, which was sitting like legally in Amsterdam.
[971.0s] But I was sitting in the Berlin office, which was the C++ team of Gavin Wood, you know, who later created Parity and Polkadot.
[980.3s] And so, but this gave me this specific opportunity to kind of that I could kind of speak up to Gavin, because he couldn't fire me.
[989.5s] because it wasn't the other team.
[991.1s] So I kind of did that.
[993.7s] So I think he didn't like it that much.
[997.3s] But basically, it was, I mean, when I joined, and I really, you know, the idea was, hey, let's build a, you know, web three browser that where applications can run, and they can then talk to smart contracts and stuff.
[1013.8s] That felt like a completely impossible task.
[1016.9s] Because I didn't understand any of that shit.
[1020.7s] That was completely novel.
[1022.0s] I mean, they literally invented a virtual machine from scratch, right?
[1025.3s] And then you have ABI and all of this low-level stuff.
[1028.7s] And Solidity was in its early days.
[1031.7s] Gavin already hired Christian Reitwiesener, who is the Solidity developer.
[1038.5s] So, basically, me trying to figure stuff out was asking Christian or, you know, trying to, I don't know, asking some people to figure out how stuff works.
[1048.8s] There was no proper documentation or anything.
[1051.2s] And within three months, we had the first working version of the Myth Browser, which is actually, in hindsight, a completely impossible task.
[1061.8s] that was achieved here.
[1064.8s] Because the tooling was so, I mean, non-existent, basically.
[1068.9s] So there was pretty much solidity.
[1070.5s] There was Web3.js in its very early version.
[1073.3s] It was started by, I think, Jeffrey and then Gavin continued it, and then Marek came in, who was supposed to be developing this library.
[1081.8s] For the people who don't know what Web3.js is, it's basically kind of like this little library that you use in the middle.
[1088.0s] So if you're a JavaScript developer, you know JavaScript, right?
[1090.4s] You don't know Solidity and you don't know how to speak to the EVM.
[1093.8s] And Web3.js is doing exactly that kind of translation.
[1097.0s] So that in your code, you can just call functions, like on an object, like you would do in JavaScript, but it translated to EVM bytecode so that the smart connect on the end can understand it.
[1108.8s] And that was in its very early days and also very confusingly written.
[1112.6s] I mean, the API was quite confusing too.
[1115.8s] And that was kind of like the main tool.
[1118.2s] And then we put that into that browser.
[1121.1s] And yeah, I mean, we basically, you know, there was no...
[1128.3s] standard way of how a D app would interact with a smart contract.
[1132.4s] There was nothing yet there.
[1134.2s] It was all just us making it up, basically.
[1138.0s] And Web3JS kind of was the middleman.
[1141.2s] So we injected that object into a D app.
[1145.3s] When you load an app in this browser, we injected this Web3 object in.
[1148.8s] And the idea was, OK, now D apps can use this Web3 object to talk to smart contracts, like it's a JavaScript object.
[1157.0s] That's kind of like that what later became this injected object kind of later became the Ethereum provider.
[1164.5s] That's how MetaMask, you know, and other extensions, for example, and apps talk to the app.
[1173.0s] But yeah, you had to basically figure everything out with Mist.
[1176.2s] I didn't listen to the space with Alex, but he probably already explained all of that too, I guess.
[1182.0s] So probably a lot of overlap here.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1184.7s] Yeah, yeah, there is.
[1186.3s] I just wanted to get a bit of different perspectives, because I know Alex was a bit on the different side of things, whereas he didn't really code as much, but he put together the team and some of the thought process behind things, whereas you were more like the coder and developer of things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1207.3s] Yeah.
[1208.0s] I mean, he was the visionary, you know, he had the idea with the Mist browser and, and, you know, he, he was a great UX designer.
[1215.2s] So he basically built all the front ends and the interfaces and put them all into something existing.
[1221.3s] Um,
[1222.5s] And yeah, I mean, then basically the first T app that we built was a wallet.
[1228.0s] It was the Ethereum wallet.
[1230.8s] And because people wanted to have that wallet before we had the browser fully ready, we even packaged a version that kind of like just loaded the wallet without the browser part.
[1239.1s] But it's on the end was exact same code base.
[1241.5s] And that's why there's like this notion of a missed browser and missed wallet.
[1245.9s] And it was all confusing for people because they were pretty much similar, but kind of different.
[1252.4s] So, there was the version that you could download the Mist browser, where the wallet was one app, or you could have the prepackaged, you know, just wallet.
[1260.7s] And it was one of the better looking, you know, wallets out there.
[1266.6s] I mean, at the time, you know, I mean, definitely, everything was pretty ugly looking at the time.
[1271.9s] And, I mean, and you could interact with smart contracts.
[1275.5s] And then Alex came up with the idea to make a generic kind of a page where you could just load any smart contract.
[1282.0s] And based on the ABI, it would completely display you like input fields for the functions.
[1287.3s] So you can just interact with the smart kind of right from an interface.
[1292.1s] And yeah, I mean, the Mist browser was pretty much in use from the beginning of the network.
[1300.0s] up until like, I mean, pretty busy in use for a year after that, or one and a half years after that.
[1307.7s] The problem what happened is because we wanted to try the full on decentralized way, that means
[1313.9s] the app was actually running a full node under the hood.
[1316.8s] So when you're running it, it actually spin up a guest node under the hood, which then synchronizes the blockchain.
[1323.3s] And when it synchronized the blockchain, we popped up the interface, you know, and then it could do stuff.
[1329.5s] So the longer the chain got, the slower the synchronization process was.
[1333.6s] And obviously, if you were not using the misbrowser for a few weeks, then you know, the synchronization was
[1340.5s] a little slower.
[1343.4s] Hence, the user experience was not great.
[1346.5s] And that kind of like inspired, you know, Koumaris from MetaMask to create MetaMask.
[1352.8s] You know, he wanted to make the less decentralized version as a browser extension, which just used an RPC endpoint, an external one, so you don't have to synchronize the whole node.
[1364.3s] And yeah, in a way, you know, MetaMask was an answer to the missed browser in a way to make it a bit more user friendly.
[1370.7s] while we try to do it the full-on decentralized way, you know, and see how well this can work.
[1378.6s] One interesting thing is that in 2016 the DAO happened, the first autonomous organization or the first DAO ever, I mean bigger one, and the main interface for the DAO was literally the Mist browser because you could load in the DAO contract and you had got this interface where you could interact with
[1399.6s] at the DAO.
[1400.4s] So they used that, our Mistbrowser as kind of like the front end for it.
[1406.8s] Yeah, and that then blew up.
[1409.0s] So split the network in two, in a way.
[1412.1s] Yeah, it was, I mean, the Mistbrowser was like an essential part of the Ethereum history.
[1419.6s] It was kind of the first one and a half years of discovering smart contracts.
[1425.1s] And I think what it did is, I mean, not only was it the wallet for everybody,
[1429.5s] at the time, but also inspired all the developers and D apps that came after that because they kind of literally, um, they wanted to be at a similar, you know, UX level on par with the miss browser.
[1443.9s] So I think we kind of leveled the game a little bit, or we lifted up the level of, you know, what people build.
[1449.7s] Um, it was not so nerdy looking like an old school windows three 11, you know, window or whatever, but it was a bit cooler looking.
[1458.7s] Yeah, and it was kind of we paved the way for how do you build DApps.
[1466.4s] I built some example DApps and example modules and tools you could use in DApps and I made videos explaining how you build DApps.
[1477.2s] I was kind of figuring it all out and then explaining it to others of how you do all of this stuff, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1486.5s] Yeah, that's so interesting.
[1487.7s] It was just, it was more, you know, laying the tracks as you were going, like as the, as the, the, the air, the airplane was in the sky, you were making adjustments, which is, which is difficult.
[1499.7s] And I know Vitalik has kind of, you know, talked about that a bit when it comes to building Ethereum, like the planes in the sky already, you know, it's,
[1510.3s] it's kind of hard to adjust at times why this thing is already moving.
[1517.0s] So yeah, that's really great.
[1520.6s] And I know you alluded to the Dow, but did you know that Alex actually tried to start a little Dow with mist like a year before the Dow?
[1533.5s] And there's a GitHub page for it too and everything.
[1536.1s] And I even talked to Alex about it.
[1537.8s] I was like, hey, remember, you tried to start a DAO with Mistcoin?
[1541.1s] And he's like, I don't even remember that.
[1543.3s] It was pretty.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1544.2s] I mean, yeah, I mean, I was there, obviously.
[1547.4s] I mean, what he did is basically he built some example contracts.
[1551.7s] as kind of like little example code snippets and put them on the Ethereum website.
[1557.5s] He just wanted to show people what can be done with smart contracts and one example was like a voting contract, like a DAO basically.
[1566.5s] That was one of the examples on the Ethereum website.
[1570.7s] Yeah, I mean with the Mistbrowser you could have an interface for it and I mean this definitely inspired the DAO.
[1576.7s] Yeah, I mean that example contract certainly inspired Christoph Jentsch who then later built the DAO.
[1584.1s] Yeah, I mean, it was just not used.
[1585.9s] There was no, there was no DAO that was kind of like, you know, published and voted on.
[1589.9s] It was just basically the first kind of code of it.
[1593.4s] No, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1593.9s] I mean, it just adds further to the history and the lore of what was, you know, trying to be kind of implemented or played around with by, you know, you guys with, you know, MissCoin and just, you know, the, the beginning iterations of all these, these new ideas.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1611.0s] I mean everything was already like you know this is the thing and like when people talk about NFTs or tokens or DAOs I mean these ideas they were around since pretty much the beginning and we did the early experiments and play around and explanation videos and all of this stuff and you know code examples just to
[1633.5s] Yeah, show what's possible.
[1635.8s] But it was obviously, it took a long time for people to really kind of finally build all the more sophisticated versions out that on the end were used by thousands of people.
[1647.5s] Like the DAO, for example, that was kind of a bit unexpectedly fast growing.
[1653.7s] Let's call it like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1655.9s] Yeah.
[1657.1s] All right.
[1658.3s] Now for the juicy question, what, you know, when was the
[1663.4s] inspiration or thought process, or what was the inspiration or thought process into creating the ERC20 standard?
[1673.2s] Did you reference any like pieces of prior development or use any pieces of research to do so?
[1680.7s] Or was it more of just like bouncing ideas and conversations back and forth with like you and FlightAlaic or some other developer?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1688.0s] Yeah, I mean, so basically what happened here is
[1694.0s] that Vitalik, I mean, people wanted to make tokens on Ethereum.
[1698.4s] There were like demands for that.
[1700.1s] And then Vitalik, we had this kind of wiki pages in Ethereum.
[1704.7s] And Vitalik wrote like a wiki page called, I think he called it standard ABI contracts or whatever, you know, he gave it some weird name.
[1713.8s] And he wrote three kind of standard or basic ideas of a standard.
[1718.2s] One was the token standard.
[1720.3s] The other one was some kind of registry thing.
[1724.6s] I forgot what the third one was.
[1726.3s] So we had this discussion internally, you know, like some people from the community and basically people from within Ethereum and we discussed about this.
[1736.4s] And at the time, Martin BC actually created a repository in Ethereum GitHub
[1743.2s] And they called it EIP.
[1745.1s] And his idea was to make Ethereum improvement proposals, right?
[1748.3s] So that we can evolve the chain.
[1749.8s] And Martin was really just focused on, you know, the consensus development.
[1754.4s] And, you know, he wanted to introduce Wasm instead of the EVM.
[1757.9s] And so his idea was to have like this place where improvements proposals can be proposed.
[1763.2s] That happened pretty much exactly the same time.
[1766.6s] uh, when, you know, when is it is 20 happened.
[1769.0s] And so I thought, okay, that's actually a great place to kind of like put this out there.
[1775.4s] what Vitalik here initially drafted and have a proper discussion.
[1780.8s] I took this example and I created a document in the ERP space and I called it ERC, Ethereum Request for Comment.
[1790.5s] This is based on this RFC process called Request for Comment in the Web Standards.
[1797.3s] And I just changed a few little things, even changed a bit the order on some function names and put it in the proper specification.
[1804.0s] So kind of my work was to put it in a proper format, let's say.
[1809.7s] And then the discussion really started to shift over there and pretty much 60
[1817.9s] some people started discussing and basically on the end, we didn't change much, but we just had a bunch of back and forth, over 300 comments.
[1826.3s] And then people started really implementing it this way.
[1828.7s] And because for example, I was not fully in agreement with all the functions.
[1832.3s] For example, I was not a fan of this transfer from and disapprove functions.
[1836.4s] I thought we should actually notify the smart contract and not just allow an external contract to then pull in money.
[1845.5s] That's why when I created the Mistcoin, which was basically just the idea of, OK, let me just make an example token so we can test it out in the Mist browser because we needed a token to test it in our interfaces.
[1859.0s] And I just thought, OK, let me just create one on the mainnet.
[1862.3s] And I specifically created it without those functions that I didn't like.
[1867.5s] Hence why the original Mistcoin doesn't have the approve and transfer from function.
[1872.8s] which then makes it nowadays incompatible with Uniswap and hence why it needed to be wrapped.
[1879.2s] It needed to be wrapped so it gets these transfer form functions.
[1882.9s] I created this while we were discussing and in this wiki page with Vitalik, I created this example token just to test around and play around with it.
[1895.1s] Then two weeks later, I actually created the ERC draft, like the specification issue.
[1900.9s] And it was just the issue number 20.
[1902.6s] So I just created an issue.
[1904.1s] It happened to be number 20.
[1905.9s] And I called it Ethereum request for comment.
[1908.9s] And yeah, that kind of became later the standard name.
[1912.3s] There was never the intention of it at all.
[1915.7s] And my, you know, little test token there then was just sitting around on my wallet, like as a little historical aspect.
[1927.8s] Um, and already in the early days, there were some people, we send it to some people just for fun, just to also test the, the miss browser interface and the wallet and show people that, you know, you can see these tokens and how it works.
[1940.4s] Um, so Alex gave some out for free.
[1943.2s] Uh, you know, we just like spread it.
[1945.8s] Um, and then over the years, other people came to me and ask, Hey, can you have some, I would really collect.
[1950.9s] And I really didn't care much, honestly, um, because it was just a test token really.
[1956.9s] Um, but that was also the whole, the whole year C20 explosion kind of started, um, pretty much.
[1966.5s] So in November, 2017, I kind of put that proposal up there and.
[1973.0s] what it really made possible for people is there was the days of the ICO.
[1978.3s] So people wanted to make ICOs.
[1980.1s] And suddenly, there was, you know, the possibility that you could create a token Ethereum, which with very little effort, and you could technically fundraise with this, it was the idea of many people, without that you have to create your own blockchain and everything.
[1995.7s] Which also had the caveat that you needed to figure out what your token does, which is probably the downside of many of the ICOs later, that they didn't really have the proper purpose, I guess.
[2011.9s] But it exploded, really.
[2013.4s] Basically, four or five months after that,
[2018.0s] after ASC20's proposal, it really started to kind of like, you know, go bananas.
[2024.0s] And hence why in 2016 and 17 and 18, we had all of this crazy ICO boom cycles with eventually billions of dollars, I guess, hundreds of billions of dollars being raised in
[2041.7s] Yeah, ICOs, pretty much.
[2045.3s] And actually, funny enough, you know, like, I didn't really actually really correlate all of this ICO stuff and all of this to me at all, until like Florian Klotz from Common Ground told me, hey, Fabian, actually, we sat in the car once and he told me, actually, do you realize that you created ESC20 and with that, all of this became like,
[2067.1s] possible.
[2068.1s] And that was like in 2016, some more or later, actually.
[2071.1s] And that's the first time that I kind of even realized this, because I didn't really think about it that much, honestly, that this was somehow correlated.
[2084.3s] Yeah, this is the early day story.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2087.7s] Yeah, so when it came to the ERC-20 standard, you were saying that it was like a group of, there was actually like a wiki page and a group of like 60 people that were talking back and forth and kind of like collaborating on, you know, figuring out the standard?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2104.8s] I mean, the initial proposal was actually from Vitalik and then we just, I just changed a few things.
[2111.3s] So the proposal was pretty much Vitalik's idea in its initial form.
[2115.6s] And, uh, we then just discussed, I mean, I made a little bit of changes and I brought it into a format that, you know, uh, allowed actually people to understand how it works and everything else, because it just threw together things quickly in a, in a wiki page.
[2129.9s] And then after that, the conversations happened, you know, where there was back and forth on certain aspects of it, but ultimately when we kind of, um, kind of agreed to, you know, more or less.
[2143.1s] solid version, it didn't change that much from, I mean, there was a few things added, but it didn't, that didn't change massively from the initial idea.
[2152.6s] Um, the fun fact is that it wasn't draft until 2017.
[2157.5s] So I only really moved it from draft to final in, I think, September, 2017.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2163.8s] Wow.
[2164.4s] Okay.
[2164.9s] Yeah, that way.
[2165.7s] Yeah.
[2165.9s] I didn't know that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2166.9s] It was way, way, way off that or as he massively adopted that this even moved into the final state.
[2172.7s] Why?
[2173.0s] Because I thought that was a point where it's definitely not going to change anymore.
[2176.9s] I mean, it was so widely used that the chances that it's going to change zero.
[2182.1s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2182.6s] Yeah.
[2183.2s] Did you believe like that standard?
[2186.6s] Maybe?
[2187.2s] I don't know if it was like, let's say 2015 when you were writing it.
[2190.9s] Did you believe that the ERC-20, that standard, would achieve the relevance that it did and be as big as it is here?
[2198.5s] You didn't think that?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2200.2s] No, not at all.
[2201.2s] I mean, in fact, I didn't even care at all.
[2203.2s] I mean, there was not the I mean, I mean, I knew people want to make tokens, I didn't expect that this specific standard will make make it and even there was no standardization process, there was not even the idea of that, you know, we need to now talk about smart contract standards.
[2217.0s] I mean, it was just that people want to make tokens.
[2220.0s] So we came up with some, you know, way of how you can make tokens.
[2223.0s] And you know, that that's what it was, only in hindsight later,
[2228.2s] it was clear that this was, you know, the first smart connect standard on top of this, the most successful one.
[2234.7s] And on top of this, that's the process of how you have to do this, you know, you now come together, you create your own standards, and then people, if they're using it, it becomes an actual standard.
[2244.5s] And then, you know, this is what's needed for an EVM chain, there was no, there was this was not really clear at all.
[2250.1s] I mean, we had no idea.
[2251.9s] There was no process or anything.
[2254.3s] It just was made up as we went.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2259.7s] So basically you said it wasn't really finalized until September 2017 and then a few months later that's when the ERC 721 was finalized as a standard, correct?
[2273.3s] Or did 721 also take...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2278.2s] So the thing, yeah, 721 was actually created in, I think, October 2017.
[2284.1s] So that was even after that.
[2286.0s] So the thing is, when basically the ICO wave kind of flattened down a little bit, or crashed, then people kind of moved on and think, hey, what can you else do with tokens than just like, you know, numbers.
[2297.3s] So I mean, there was already the ideas of NFTs was nothing new, so that you could, you know, authenticate things on a blockchain and that you can
[2305.4s] You make unique things that was already around, but there was just, it was, people were so busy creating ICOs and investing in ICOs, I guess that really, um, there was all the focus.
[2316.1s] So there was some like, and then, yeah, and pretty much in 2017, when this came, you know, when this kind of hype slowed down a little bit, that's when these other ideas became a bit more, you know, in the focus.
[2330.5s] And then there was this people who think, okay, let's create,
[2333.7s] you know, an NFT standard.
[2335.1s] And even before 721, which on the end, 721 is a fairly simple modification of ESC20, because it only really changed the token amount that you transfer to a token ID.
[2350.2s] And they did some other modifications to introduce, for example, exactly what I want to introduce this, that you notify another smart contract.
[2357.5s] They introduced it as well, but also this came actually out of earlier improvements.
[2364.4s] So basically after he was created and right after it already started to become popular, there were people who were thinking, Hey, we need to improve this token standard because it was not perfect.
[2374.8s] The whole idea that you needed to use a proof-and-transfer form was a total hack.
[2379.1s] I mean, I never liked it because it was a hack, but the agreement back in the day when we wrote it was, okay, we don't know what people can build on a smart coin blockchain, and we don't know what's the best practice in such a system.
[2392.5s] And before we make a mistake and people lose money, let's do the most safe way we can do, which just means we just approve a contract and then
[2399.2s] this contract can move it.
[2400.8s] If we would notify another contract after a transaction happened, that could lead to all crazy other potential vulnerabilities that we just were not fully understanding at the time, hence why we didn't go with that.
[2413.5s] Even though that was the right approach to take, hence why all of these improvement proposals after, there was a standard called 223.
[2422.9s] I mean, guess what, it's 200 senders later.
[2424.5s] Or 200 at least, you know, issues.
[2429.5s] By the way, also what needs to be understood, the IP repository, the way GitHub works is every time you create an issue, or you make a pull request, it counts up a number.
[2438.8s] So if we have 7,000, you know,
[2442.0s] ERCs, that doesn't mean this is 7,000, or 7,000, there's a number 7,000, that doesn't mean there's 7,000 standard proposals.
[2450.2s] People just took this issue number as a counter.
[2452.6s] And yeah, there's many issues, just discussions sometimes in the middle, and that counted up the number.
[2460.5s] So 223 was the first one who kind of tried to solve this problem of notifying the other contracts.
[2466.8s] That didn't really get traction.
[2468.7s] Then Jordi Bailino had this idea of 777.
[2473.7s] that was a bit later to unify this as well.
[2477.2s] And basically the 721 standard kind of really took from this 223 idea, kind of incorporated this.
[2486.3s] That's why the NFT center has a safe transfer function or a safe transfer from or whatever it's called.
[2492.8s] And that's the kind of like the idea of like, you know, notifying the other contract as well.
[2497.8s] So they kind of kept them both like,
[2500.0s] the original transfer function and plus the safe transfer function which then on the end makes the whole standard even more quirky looking and very inconsistent and and hence why this is all pretty much like you know a hack something that tries to be backwards compatible but also tries to introduce new features and then you have all of these different function namings that are very confusing hence why we're in the mess and what you said initially with you know ethereum is like a plane that is flying and you're trying to fix it as it flies
[2527.2s] The thing is, the more it flies, the bigger it gets.
[2531.0s] And the more it gets, it's more like a ship, actually.
[2533.5s] It's like the bigger the ship gets, the slower you can move it around, right?
[2537.7s] Like a big ship needs a very big radius.
[2539.5s] A small ship needs a small radius.
[2542.3s] Hence, why any of these things, once there's a network effect, like, you know, ESC20 or the token standards, it gets very difficult to...
[2554.8s] it gets very difficult to make changes and convince people of novel ideas and introducing new standards.
[2562.3s] Hence why it took so long, even for such a small addition like an NFT versus a token, which is pretty much the same.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2572.6s] No, yeah, I was actually looking into the ERC-223 recently, and it kind of made me think a bit about, you know, just the ERC-20 and if it was created in, you know, if it could have been, really my question for you is like, looking back now and what you know today, is there anything that you would have added to the ERC-20 standard to make it better?
[2601.4s] Or do you think it was a good first iteration that really is going to continue to thrive for these, you know, coming years?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2609.9s] I mean, I mean, we all know the quirkiness of ESC 20, you know, and this whole thing with like approving
[2617.6s] you know, contracts, you know, that's what led to so many losses, right?
[2622.1s] Because people go to a website, then the interface of MetaMask says, oh, this website tries to request, you know, access to your funds, and then it sounds, looks also harmless, and then people click OK, and suddenly all the money's gone.
[2634.7s] Because this approve process, as nice as it is, it's hyper dangerous.
[2638.8s] You're literally approving a third party to move your money.
[2642.5s] So it's almost the same as giving them the key to your car or to your house.
[2646.8s] And so the thing is, what I did over the last few years is exactly what you just said, you know, I mean, fixing all of these standards.
[2655.6s] This is what I have done with Luxor.
[2657.4s] I mean, on the end, they were not, I mean, they were good first iterations, that's for sure.
[2662.1s] And they were the first, you know, experiments, but they were by no means thought out.
[2667.3s] Neither did we even have the knowledge or understanding, you know, how the space works and how, you know, people, what kind of smart context people will build and how they will interact with each other and what makes sense, what doesn't make sense.
[2679.9s] There was just no experience at the time.
[2682.3s] So hence it was the best there was at the time, but it's by no means the best we could do today.
[2688.8s] And, uh, I mean, that's what I did in Luxo, you know, I literally standardized, um, I improved all these standards, you know, actually we introduced a new year as a 20, that's called LSP seven or Luxo standards proposal number seven.
[2702.7s] And we introduced a new NFT is called LSP eight.
[2706.6s] And we introduced a smart connect account.
[2709.2s] Um, that is a very multifunctional super generic smart account.
[2716.0s] that everybody would probably need right now if they would understand the tech.
[2722.5s] But yeah, it's exactly that.
[2724.3s] So I spent the last five years redoing this stuff because it was just simply not, it was just like, you know, it grew based on a need, but it didn't came out of sophisticated research.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2739.0s] Yeah, for sure.
[2739.8s] I have plenty of questions about Luxco, which
[2743.8s] I want to finish up on so that we can get everybody nice and fresh about the Luxo environment.
[2751.2s] One interesting question that I had that's been asked to me by a few people.
[2756.7s] What was the whole idea behind the whole Doge and ETH bridge and why send 5% of Mistcoin supply to the Doge ETH bridge multi-sig?
[2768.2s] Like, I don't know if you're familiar with that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2770.9s] Yeah.
[2771.8s] Yeah.
[2772.9s] Um, I mean, this, this was like something that like, uh, Vitalik, I mean, I think there was this whole thing then.
[2779.0s] So basically, you know, the first copy of, of Bitcoin was, you know, Litecoin.
[2784.8s] And then, you know, at some point somebody just misspelled the word dog and then someone else thought it was super funny to create another
[2794.2s] clone of Bitcoin and calling it Dogecoin, just for the lulz, basically.
[2800.5s] And you know, that thing completely took off.
[2802.2s] It was literally the first meme coin.
[2804.2s] And because it took so much off, and at the time, there was, I think it got quite some attention.
[2809.9s] And this was, I'm not sure what the status of Ethereum was at the time, how big it was, or how popular we were at the time.
[2817.7s] But it was basically the idea to, I think it was the idea to kind of like, you know,
[2824.4s] let's say marry or like kind of like, you know, kind of, yeah, maybe like, you know, cross the bridge back again to the Ethereum, to the Bitcoin world.
[2835.6s] So because what happened is when Ethereum came onto the scene, you know, there was a lot of people were very hyped about it.
[2843.1s] They thought like, this is the next big thing, you know, I mean, same as I, I came, obviously we were all Bitcoiners, you know, because that's what it was, you know, that was the biggest thing we all,
[2852.0s] thought, okay, Bitcoin, maybe the big master chain, and all the others are super cool and interesting experiments.
[2859.3s] But we were all hyped about Ethereum as well.
[2861.8s] But there were some people who were not.
[2865.8s] They were like, feel very threatened, because they thought, okay, if now people go to Ethereum, then Bitcoin will lose in value.
[2872.4s] But we need to understand Bitcoin is the most decentralized and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2876.7s] So yet, this was the time when the Bitcoin maximalist was born.
[2880.8s] And
[2882.2s] Dogecoin, the Bitcoiners were kind of okay with Dogecoin because it used kind of the same protocol.
[2887.2s] And, and the idea of Dogecoin and befriending it in a way with with Ethereum, and I think this was Alex, you know, try, I guess, and this, it was really just more like an experiment, you know, an experiment of like, hey, can we build a bridge?
[2903.6s] And, you know, can we build a bridge between kind of Dogecoin and Ethereum, which is the same as building a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum and
[2910.7s] And he just found this with the Miscon funny, I guess.
[2915.1s] I mean, this was something he did.
[2917.7s] I found it interesting, but I didn't care much, actually, at the time about it, really.
[2925.3s] It was just a play, I would say.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2928.5s] Yeah.
[2929.0s] Who sent the 50,000 miss there?
[2931.9s] Do you know?
[2932.4s] I think it was him.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2935.0s] I mean, I'm not sure.
[2935.8s] I think it was him.
[2938.0s] It was definitely not me.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2940.8s] Yeah, it's something that we're very interested in over at the DAO, to hopefully maybe get some initiatives started with it.
[2946.8s] But there's a lot of famous people on that multi-sig there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2951.2s] So I don't know, maybe you have to explain to me, it's still there?
[2956.2s] It's still existing?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2958.0s] Yeah, I mean...
[2959.2s] Um, all the all the ethereum was taken out obviously because there was there was it was a bounty to to get the bridge made So all the ethereum was taken out, but there still sits five percent of the mist Uh supply, uh, it's just a funny interesting little Uh, yeah tidbit, but I got the signers on it are uh, alex um Vitalik, I don't know.
[2986.9s] Are you a signer on it?
[2988.4s] I'm not sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2989.1s] No, I was not.
[2990.1s] I didn't really care about that bridge too much.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2992.9s] Yeah, so I think there's eight signers or six signers or something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2997.7s] The question is, do they still have the keys?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2999.8s] Yeah, that's the question.
[3001.0s] But I mean, I'm sure Vitalik and all those people have a lot more going on at the moment.
[3006.7s] So maybe one day, maybe one day there'll be a nice little gift to the DAO to get some initiatives going.
[3014.1s] But just something I was thinking about.
[3017.8s] So what was your initial...
[3019.8s] reaction when you discovered the recent MissCoin revival and what was taking place in the community and how it began to build around such an interesting piece of history?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3031.3s] I mean, there were people over the years who asked me if I could send them, so I sent them a bit here and there, but it was also not that easy to even interact with the contract because it was kind of like, you could do sending and stuff like this, but
[3049.3s] You could import it into, you know, MetaMask obviously, but you couldn't interact with more complex contracts because of that missing function and everybody agreeing to this transfer from stuff.
[3062.9s] Yeah, I mean, I just sent a few around just for fun.
[3065.1s] I honestly didn't think about, I didn't, I mean, when I created it, I kind of thought, hmm, could this have value in the future?
[3072.9s] And then I thought shortly about it and thought, hmm, but for what people would use it, I don't know.
[3078.4s] So I don't think so.
[3080.4s] That was my thought back in the day.
[3082.9s] And, and then when people, you know, were interested, I thought, sure, cool, collect it.
[3088.9s] You know, I mean, there's a lot of people collect all kinds of stuff.
[3091.2s] So I thought maybe this can become a collectible.
[3094.2s] And then when, I don't know, the, the, the Miscon guy who made the Miscon Twitter account came and,
[3104.1s] you know, said that he decorated this wrapper and now it can be used and traded and they were all like super hyped about it.
[3109.9s] And I thought, okay, that's interesting.
[3112.4s] That's very unexpected.
[3114.0s] Um, but it kind of makes sense, you know, in, in the time where meme coins are the big deal and collectibles and NFTs and everything is about, and now also it is a piece of history, right?
[3123.9s] It is literally the ultimate of piece of this token history because it is the first of its kind.
[3130.6s] And it has been really around for a long time.
[3135.3s] And even with the Dogecoin bridge, that's kind of funny.
[3139.6s] So yeah, I mean, it's totally, you know, part of the Ethereum evolution since pretty much the beginning.
[3146.9s] And now it's kind of been resurrected in some funny way.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3151.8s] Yeah, that kind of leads to my next question.
[3156.4s] Do you have any suggestions or any cool initiatives or ideas you would like to see for the further development of Mistcoin?
[3166.5s] Or is it you think just a loan on the historical value that it would carry on to be a token that's at least collected and held in people's wallets?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3182.3s] I mean, I mean, it's in a way, you know, same with art, you know, why is art interesting?
[3187.0s] I mean, on the one hand, it's about the idea, the concept, but it's also really often about the history.
[3191.7s] And fun fact, you know, art when it becomes a lot more valuable when the artist dies, that doesn't mean I'm going to die, but.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3198.8s] Oh, yeah.
[3199.7s] Whoa.
[3199.9s] Relax, Fabi.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3201.3s] Yeah.
[3201.8s] No, I'm just saying that, you know, once thing, once time passed and once the history happened,
[3207.2s] You know, that's when this stuff becomes super interesting suddenly.
[3211.4s] And suddenly it's like, you know, the thing that people talk about.
[3216.5s] And yeah, because it really enshrines this time at the time.
[3220.5s] So the collectible aspect is definitely there.
[3223.8s] And that's going to grow just because, you know, time passes more on and the Ethereum history and the token history.
[3231.0s] I mean, this space has grown to what it is because of the token standard.
[3235.2s] And because of everything that happened after, literally almost every business, you go to any blockchain conference, 99% of those projects, they're about just tokens or NFTs nowadays as well.
[3247.2s] And yeah, so this is basically a huge piece of history.
[3252.7s] But honestly, you know, the cool thing about tokens is
[3255.5s] that it is the same like with Dogecoin or whatever.
[3259.1s] I mean, things can be used for whatever people want to use it for.
[3263.1s] They could create a community around it that serves other purposes and functionalities than just a collection.
[3270.9s] And then you can wrap it and you can even issue NFTs out of this.
[3276.5s] Maybe we'll bridge over to Luxor at some point.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3281.6s] Is that in Fabian's plans?
[3284.5s] Is that in your plans?
[3285.4s] Is that potentially a secret alpha here?
[3288.6s] Like, what's going on?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3291.9s] I mean, we are working on a bridge together with Hashi.
[3296.3s] And that will be a generic bridge that could also potentially bridge things like MistCon over.
[3302.2s] So yeah, I mean, once that bridge is working, you can pretty much
[3307.0s] I mean, we have to see how the minting process works, but technically you could bridge almost everything.
[3313.6s] So, I mean, every token, let's call it like that, at least in the early form.
[3318.3s] I mean, we have to see, I mean, probably in the beginning, we have to see if this is a manual thing, that there needs to be some whitelisted, or if it just works for everyone, we have to see.
[3327.7s] But technically, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3330.1s] I think we'd make the whitelist, Fabian.
[3332.4s] I think we would.
[3333.4s] But that's just...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3334.3s] I mean, I would definitely like to see it switching over to Luxor, that's for sure.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3339.0s] Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of questions about...
[3342.6s] Luxo as well.
[3344.2s] So, yeah, let's head over to a few of those questions.
[3352.2s] Well, first, how was your experience with Ethereum and the ERC standard kind of influenced the development approach in what you're working on with Luxo, which we touched up a bit on, but I mean, if you would like to elaborate again.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3368.5s] Yeah, I mean, it all started out as the idea of, okay, how can, how can we bring blockchain, you know, to ordinary, you know, users that are not so technical?
[3377.9s] How can we bring blockchain to the masses?
[3379.7s] And how can we bring it to, you know, the non technical people of the world?
[3383.9s] And I mean, the idea of, you know, a blockchain formed for around lifestyle and, you know, and
[3391.5s] and culture was just a really good fit, because at the time it was all about money and DeFi.
[3397.7s] And sure, you could build the money Legos and extend this to eternity, but blockchain can do just so much more.
[3406.3s] Blockchain can be relevant for governance, voting, network states, social media can help with truth and journalism, and it can help with funding across the globe.
[3419.9s] community efforts of all kinds, it can help with memberships, it can help with pretty much anything when humans need to coordinate.
[3429.6s] Blockchain can be a key factor and needs to be a key factor of it.
[3433.8s] And that was just something that
[3439.2s] was not really on the forefront at the time, but it was really clear to me that, you know, if we create such, I mean, this could be the perfect Broshan horse to bring decentralization into the masses.
[3448.9s] You know, if you do things that feel easy and fun, social and culture, you know, and lifestyle, then, uh, you get, you know, people who are usually not willing to, you know, invest their life savings to random coins, uh,
[3464.9s] you know, interested, right?
[3466.3s] And that was the idea of Luxor, really.
[3468.3s] But I also realized that the most important piece here is
[3472.2s] the wallet and the account that you're using, you know, that needs to be simple, that needs to be more than just a private key, that needs to be something that's actually functional.
[3482.5s] So that kind of like, you know, really, and there's a fun fact that, you know, ESC 725, which is the core piece of Luxor, if you will, that's a standard that I proposed in 2017.
[3495.3s] And guess what, it's the exact standard after 721.
[3499.1s] There is 7.2 and 7.2.3, they were just two other GitHub issues that were not really relevant.
[3507.7s] I mean, there were three GitHub issues in the middle, I think, that didn't have really that much importance.
[3517.0s] And so it's the exact standard after 7.1.
[3519.5s] So while those guys modified ESC20 and came up with the idea, hey, let's just, you know, make it a transferable ID rather than an amount, I came up with the SmartConnect account.
[3531.0s] which is kind of crazy actually if you think about it.
[3535.3s] So and this I created before I created Luxor or before we started Luxor the idea but I realized you know when we discussed Luxor that this standard is really essential because it must you know if we don't have a proper
[3552.9s] account, you know, then how do you get this to the masses?
[3555.8s] And also, if you want to introduce lifestyle things, you know, it's about brands and, and creators and people want to collect and they want to show what they are.
[3564.0s] The account, you know, needs to be a profile.
[3567.3s] It needs to be something that you humanly identify with.
[3570.7s] It needs to be something that's long lasting, right?
[3573.2s] It goes a little bit opposite to the Bitcoin idea where you want to be as hidden as possible.
[3577.4s] Hence never use the private key twice.
[3580.0s] you know, in the early days of Bitcoin.
[3583.0s] But here's the opposite, right?
[3584.5s] We want to have identifiability.
[3587.1s] So we need to make sure that this account has a face.
[3590.7s] This account can be long term managed.
[3593.0s] This account cannot just be one private key that you now need to keep safe forever.
[3596.5s] That needs to be a proper smart contract account.
[3599.5s] So I thought of the idea about this proper smart contract account in 2017.
[3604.6s] And over the course of the last many years, six years,
[3610.8s] I basically, you know, like I built out, you know, I first formed the idea of the standards for the early versions of it and we developed as a team this account standard to its
[3626.9s] more to its final state, which is now.
[3630.9s] But along the way, we also said, hey, okay, if we're already on evolving the standards, and we anyway, you know, have a new chain, because these standards could never be adopted on an existing chain.
[3641.9s] I mean, see how difficult it is even for
[3645.3s] Ethereum to convince people to move to smart contracts and how things like 4337 took forever, you know, which was a bundle of standards that I need to form into one to even get agreement on.
[3657.3s] So you see when you have the network effect is so difficult, hence why new chain was literally perfect to introduce a new foundation.
[3665.0s] So while we are at it, we thought, okay, we can also improve the token standards, you know, and we can also improve
[3671.7s] know the NFT standard and we can then also make sure that all of this works nicely in harmony together in a holistic way and that all all of this is really like you know tuned to each other uh so that and also build in such a way that it can be even more flexible that even more stuff can be developed on top of this even more things can be standardized on top of these things so it really like kicked off the whole
[3695.8s] idea of improving the existing standard landscape when it comes to the core building blocks.
[3702.7s] So those last six years was really about, you know, like looking at this stuff from like a perspective of what if we would start from scratch, what could we do better?
[3719.8s] And how could we do it that it's more possible, you know, down the road.
[3724.7s] And that's a thought that you usually can't have in Ethereum because you need to think first of how they make sure what I'm inventing here right now is still compatible with everything that's there, right?
[3736.8s] And then I can think, what can I add?
[3739.4s] But always keep in mind that it needs to be compatible.
[3742.1s] So when you go this route, then you're very limited in what you can do.
[3747.0s] Because you can only really just move the big ship so and so many degrees.
[3751.0s] But you can't make it a 30 degree turn.
[3753.3s] Otherwise, the ship wouldn't do it.
[3756.0s] The ship doesn't follow you.
[3757.4s] So we had this great opportunity to think it up from scratch.
[3761.5s] And we basically improved the token standards in the sense that, I mean, I first started out with making sure that the function names are all the same between tokens and NFTs, because it's pretty much 90% the same kind of thing, right?
[3777.6s] Once you transfer an amount.
[3779.0s] In the other, you transfer an ID.
[3781.3s] So why would the functions be all very different?
[3784.1s] So we can unify that.
[3786.5s] Then we introduced the ability that it notifies another smart contract, but instead of going with the idea of two to three, which had like a on token receive function, or seven to one had this idea of like an on seven to one receive function.
[3805.7s] Or even like 1820, which is the 777 standard, which by the way, LXE is a 777 standard, where there was a specific contract where you needed to read if that other contract can now receive it or not.
[3820.8s] You had this idea of like the registry thing.
[3823.6s] So basically, the problem with all of those is, if you want to have a generic smart contract account,
[3829.1s] And you now need to, for every protocol that comes up in the future, add a new function just so you're able to be notified by that, you know, whatever protocol somebody comes up with.
[3839.3s] Then the chip would never end.
[3840.7s] And you would end with hundreds of functions in your nice smart contract account, right?
[3846.6s] That's not a great idea.
[3848.6s] So the first thought then was, okay, we need a universal receiver.
[3852.5s] We need a universal function that any protocol can call, and it just calls it with a type ID and some data.
[3859.7s] And based on the type ID, then your profile could do certain things.
[3865.5s] And that became the fun fact that the first standard of Luxor, it's called LSP1, is the universal receiver.
[3872.3s] So I started out with that because the first thought I was, okay, if I make a generic smart contract account, how can I make sure that tokens
[3879.2s] can be generically informing these wallets, these smart connect accounts and wallets.
[3884.8s] So, hence why, you know, universal receiver was the most important one.
[3889.4s] So, and all of these thinking, you know, this kind of thinking, you can only do when you make things from scratch in a clean way with a clean slate where you're not bound to, you know, backwards compatibility on any of this stuff.
[3902.9s] So, I think that also puts Luxor in a very unique position because it's the first chain
[3908.5s] where the foundational buildings blocks, or the first EVM chain definitely, where the foundational buildings blocks have been thought out from scratch, new, without considering to be backwards compatible to old stuff, which makes it a lot nicer, a lot cleaner.
[3928.2s] and a lot more flexible of what it can do.
[3931.9s] And it works really holistically with a generic smart account system, which is what everybody wants to get to right now, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3939.6s] Yeah.
[3940.6s] So I see Luxo touts like this innovative approach with universal profiles.
[3948.4s] How do you see universal profiles kind of changing Web3 and how it is approached by the masses?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3956.3s] I mean, it's a smart contract account.
[3957.9s] It's basically, I mean, it sounds maybe a bit bold, but it's in my opinion, the most developed and most sophisticated smart contract account in existence right now.
[3968.0s] So if you have a smart contract account, you need a few properties.
[3973.4s] One thing you need is
[3975.6s] You need to have the ability to obviously hold money or like do anything on a blockchain.
[3980.9s] So you need to be able to generically execute, right?
[3983.1s] I mean, that's what Gnosis Safe has as well, right?
[3986.1s] That's, that's kind of clear.
[3987.3s] But what else you need is this universal receiver, right?
[3992.8s] You need to be able that the smart content can react on anything.
[3996.3s] And in universal providers, it's done in such a way that you can even delegate
[4000.2s] this reaction, this notification reaction onto an external contract, you can change over time.
[4005.5s] So you can even change the way your profile reacts on incoming stuff.
[4010.2s] But most importantly, and that's funny enough, I haven't seen anywhere in any of the current smart contract account ideas, you need to be able to attach information.
[4022.0s] Because if you don't attach information, then you're missing the most key feature of an account, which is the stuff I can understand, stuff I can read.
[4030.4s] I mean, it's not only about a profile picture, right?
[4032.9s] That's the most obvious thing you can do.
[4036.3s] But if you want to have an on-chain account, you want to be able to attach information so that a protocol that interacts with your account can read certain things.
[4045.5s] You could, for example, attach KYC data.
[4048.1s] You could attach, you know, serial knowledge proofs.
[4051.7s] You could attach obviously profile pictures.
[4055.2s] You could attach, you know, some kind of lists, like follower lists or whatever else that you need to be on the profile.
[4061.3s] So you could attach so many things that a, so it just opens up the possibilities of protocols you can develop because now the accounts that interact on chain with your smart contract
[4074.9s] have information that's readable by that smart content as well.
[4078.5s] And that just opens up the possibilities like by 1000x.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4082.9s] Yeah, this is actually very interesting Fabian because I'm actually building kind of like a social PHY
[4088.7s] product at the moment.
[4089.9s] I mean, it's a bit off topic and I'm just seeing how much this type of information and, and, and use cases could blend into what we're doing.
[4099.5s] Um, when it comes to express specifically on like the influencer side and, uh, you know, profiles for influencers and kind of making these profiles, uh, like a rep reputation based,
[4115.4s] like you know score almost where you can actually kind of get an idea of the people that you're following, maybe what their trading history looks like, a lot of different things here that could overall make the space safer.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4128.9s] Yeah.
[4129.5s] So welcome to Universal Profiles.
[4130.9s] That's exactly what it is.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4132.6s] We need to have a talk then about this.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4136.1s] So if you're building your system on Universal Profiles, you literally can probably save yourself a lot of time because 80% of it is already built out.
[4145.5s] I mean, you have the core account now that is generically manageable.
[4149.2s] and executable.
[4151.3s] Now, all you need to worry about is building your dashboard that reads this information and maybe some information that gets attached there.
[4159.5s] But you have now the account.
[4161.6s] We're the first ones who have merged the information of the account with the acting address.
[4168.9s] In every other systems that have been there so far, it's always like the wallet, and then there's maybe your ENS data.
[4176.6s] And your INS holds the information like your name and maybe some other information, and then the wallet is separate from that.
[4184.1s] So problem with that is, because it's not the same thing, your wallet can swap under the hood.
[4189.5s] while the data stays at the same place.
[4192.1s] Or even if you look at Forecaster, there's your ID, you know, that's again, the wallet can change.
[4197.8s] So whatever does something on-chain is never fully tied to that information.
[4202.9s] In Universal Profiles, it's the same address, it's the same contract.
[4206.0s] Your contract has the generic key value store,
[4208.6s] that you can just call get data, whatever key you want to read.
[4212.2s] And that's whatever data stored under.
[4215.1s] And that's the same address that's also doing the interaction for another smart contract.
[4219.6s] So your smart contract knows always about message sender, right?
[4222.8s] He knows who's calling him.
[4224.5s] He can always call back and check instead of going to a third place and checking a something here in DNS registry or something in this registry or that registry, it can just look literally at the place that called him, which is the profile.
[4237.7s] The first one we merged this together, that the information space is the same as the execution space.
[4243.1s] Fun fact, that's the essence of universal profiles, it's ER7 to 5x and y.
[4249.2s] In ES7-5, the standard is split in two.
[4252.2s] X is the execution and Y
[4255.1s] is the data store.
[4256.6s] That's why, why, you know, it's funny, you know, why you can ask a question.
[4259.9s] So, um, and fun fact, that's also the human chromosomes that I only figured out later, um, by accident that I figured out, okay, actually, yes, this is the human chromosome, but, uh, it's, it's basically your, your year 75, uh, account is basically between this information store and the general execution.
[4276.4s] Then it has a bunch of other feature like the universal receiver.
[4279.6s] And then there's a key manager in front so you can properly manage that thing with multiple keys from different devices and permissions and blah blah blah It has a lot of more features but In its essence, it's just literally a smart account like literally that's what it is It's an account that has a lot more information on it than just like, you know a dump public key So are those are they so bound or can you move them around?
[4305.3s] the 725 So that's the thing
[4310.2s] I don't know how to answer this.
[4312.7s] I mean, to say it in a nice way, it's not a token.
[4318.2s] It has nothing to do with the concept of an NFT or a token.
[4321.4s] It's an account.
[4322.8s] So it's soulbound because yes, it is the account itself.
[4325.7s] So the account is the wallet.
[4328.4s] and the wallet is the profile and it's the same thing at the same address there is no differentiation so it's not that you have a wallet so your wallet and your private key is irrelevant now because that's not the one who is acting on chain what's acting on chain is your smart contract account which is also the one who holds information whoever signs the transaction to control that is irrelevant because that's like that's in the front that's like handled by the browser extension that we have
[4354.5s] that basically signs everything that goes through your key manager.
[4357.3s] The key manager checks that the stuff is allowed and that your profile is allowed to, that this controller key can do something.
[4364.8s] Once he executes, he executes through your SmartConnect account.
[4368.7s] So the other contract that you're interacting with, only reads message.sender, which is your profile.
[4374.8s] So whatever happens before, even if you have 50 steps in before, before the thing goes from offline to your profile, all the checks before,
[4385.2s] are basically irrelevant, right?
[4389.0s] They're irrelevant because it's not seen by the other smart contract.
[4393.0s] So it's soulbound because it's the same thing.
[4395.4s] There's no such thing like a wallet tied to whatever an NFT is.
[4401.0s] You only care about the universal profile address.
[4403.8s] You don't care who controls it.
[4405.8s] And you don't care how it's being controlled.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4408.7s] So basically Luxo is basically like the account abstraction chain.
[4414.4s] Basically is what I'm Because we know that because account abstraction is gonna be huge.
[4421.2s] It's a huge narrative.
[4422.6s] It's something that constantly comes up and a lot of talks with Developers that I talked to I'm not a developer by any means but when I'm talking to them and especially when I'm building a social fi product constantly account abstraction account abstracts in this because we know the next wave of
[4440.8s] of consumers are going to want to use blockchain without really knowing they're using blockchain or to some degree something like that.
[4449.1s] Okay, now you're making me kind of bullish on Luxo.
[4451.4s] I might got to go grab a bag here.
[4454.6s] That is actually really, really, really amazing.
[4458.9s] And something, like I said, I've been talking about nonstop for the past eight months as I built this product.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4465.7s] It is the ultimate of account obstruction chain.
[4467.5s] It has the first full on standardized smart contract account.
[4470.6s] Yeah, I mean, I mean, a counterstructure chain sounds a bit cheesy.
[4474.9s] I mean, I would call it, you know, the foundation for decentralized social.
[4478.8s] And yes, and whatever influencer thing you want to do on blockchain, Luxor is the place you want to build it on because everything else would be just a fucking hack.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4488.1s] So I think we should.
[4489.7s] Yeah, I think I'm going to DM you.
[4491.1s] I know you're hard to get over, but just, you know, get back to me whenever.
[4493.8s] We'll talk a bit about potentially bringing my product over there because I've been working on it for a long time.
[4499.9s] to pivot to potentially something like this or even adding it, you know, your guys's chain into it.
[4505.7s] Cause I, how would it go with data from other chains though?
[4509.8s] So say I wanted to, you know, link an address
[4513.6s] to a profile on Luxo.
[4515.9s] Is that possible or no, or is that something further down the line?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4518.5s] I mean, you can write whatever the heck you want into a user's profile as long as the user agrees to that.
[4523.4s] So, I mean, you can write whatever address is, you know, public keys from other chains in there and say, hey, this is my public keys I use in other chains.
[4530.3s] I mean, it functions like even like a complete, you can even use it like an ENS because you can write whatever you want in there.
[4536.9s] The question is how this
[4538.3s] You know, obviously you don't write the private key into your public profile because everybody can read that.
[4542.6s] Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[4543.9s] You should write the public keys in case you want to link information, say this is my profile on Luxor and I also, by the way, use the other addresses on other places.
[4552.2s] We built even these profiles in such a way that you can deploy them cross-chain at the same address.
[4557.7s] That is only possible right now for the people who created the profile with us and still kept the original browser extension because we stored that data that allows you to cross-chain deploy it on exactly the same address again on another chain.
[4573.4s] technically can happen in multiple chains.
[4575.6s] But again, people need to keep in mind, this is multiple chains, multiple isolated environments, and it's multiple smart contracts.
[4581.9s] So obviously, even though it's the same address, and maybe the same logic on both chain, it's two different smart contracts.
[4588.7s] So you can update the public picture on one, it wouldn't magically update on the other, obviously, because these things are not universally linked yet without another protocol that someone really needs to invent.
[4599.1s] But you can attach.
[4601.1s] So the thing is, you want to use
[4603.1s] You ideally want to do most everything on Luxor, because that's where your universal profile lives, that's where you get your reputation, that's where you have your interactions, that's where stuff is happening.
[4615.1s] So you want to do it on the chain where your universal profile lives.
[4618.2s] If you now have multiple universal profiles, even if they're the same address on multiple chains,
[4622.5s] it becomes a headache for users.
[4624.4s] And people do mistakes.
[4626.5s] They don't understand this whole multi-chain, cross-chain thing.
[4629.4s] And as much as like DeFi wanted to simplify this by basically telling people, oh yeah, you can have this, you know, wallet everywhere.
[4637.0s] It works for private keys, right?
[4639.1s] Because a private key can be signing on multiple chains.
[4643.8s] But it doesn't work for a smart contract account.
[4646.1s] so easily.
[4647.5s] And with private keys, you know, you have all the troubles that you have with private keys, right?
[4652.3s] So you can't really, you know, have information attached to it, you can't really, you know, manage it properly long term, it's not something that you want to build a reputation on, because you could lose it at any point in time, you know, there's no recovery ability, no social recovery, no nothing you can add to it.
[4669.1s] So it's, it's just a private key on the end.
[4672.1s] So if you want to build anything socially, you want to pick a chain, like picking a country,
[4676.5s] And then with Luxo, it's basically pretty straightforward to build anything.
[4682.6s] So right now, there's only a browser extension.
[4685.4s] There's a mobile app that's in the works, but we're also looking into ways to bring in the browser extension to mobile.
[4692.2s] But yeah, if you build a D app and you want to run it on Luxo,
[4696.9s] It works out of the box pretty much if you want to you you connect the universe brother Nothing changes you just use the same you do it the same way you do it with metamask Nothing changes for you as a as a DM developer.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4708.0s] It's the exact same thing Except that you now have the possibility to add information and read a profile picture and you know do a lot more things I mean honestly with you know, the social vibe environment how hot of a topic that is I think it would be
[4727.0s] There would be great synergy there to not only help Luxo, or help us, but help Luxo as well.
[4734.7s] A Soulcify product is literally geared specifically for this.
[4740.3s] I think you have a great opportunity there when it comes to Soulcify products.
[4745.1s] Now somebody just needs to take the leap and build it out there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4751.2s] Yeah.
[4752.0s] I mean, it's, yeah, many, many things can now be built.
[4755.5s] It's, it's like you said, it's account abstraction chain.
[4759.1s] I think that's a bit too, too cheesy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4761.1s] Once, once, once that narrative takes off and people start to talk about account abstraction, you know, you don't necessarily have to call it that, but really that's what essentially it, you know, the fundamentalist of it is there to, you know, make sure that, or make, allow people to use blockchain without really
[4781.2s] knowing that they're using blockchain and we know that's going to onboard the normal people to use it because that they all think blockchain is all, you know, hard to use and confusing when it's really, it's really not.
[4793.7s] But, um, it is for the reason.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4797.4s] I mean, the thing is, the foundation is now there.
[4800.2s] We developed it.
[4801.1s] It took five years to get there.
[4803.3s] So it was a long, you know, a long journey to get this right.
[4806.4s] So building the foundation, the smart connect standard, and to get it right, that's the hardest task.
[4812.0s] Because that shit, you don't want to change, right?
[4814.3s] If once there's adoption around a certain thing, it needs to be done on the right thing.
[4818.0s] Otherwise, you have the same problem like Ethereum has now with ES20, where something that, you know,
[4823.0s] was not perfect, became the number one.
[4825.2s] So now everybody's stuck on that.
[4827.5s] So you want to get it right, especially you want to get it right for an account.
[4831.0s] Imagine you have an account that is very limited in what it can do.
[4834.4s] And then five years down the road, you realize, fuck, we can't go back.
[4837.1s] You can't change it.
[4838.1s] And everybody went this way.
[4839.7s] And now we're all stuck in this system that is limited.
[4844.5s] So you need to get it right.
[4845.9s] Hence why it took so long to get it right.
[4847.8s] So from now on, it's only about building the interfaces for it.
[4851.1s] It's only about building the tools to use it.
[4854.0s] It's only the websites to show it and to integrate it.
[4857.0s] And you can now build everything on top of this.
[4859.0s] You can add social recovery.
[4861.0s] You can even add passkey.
[4864.2s] So you could even control your profile through a passkey from multiple devices, except that right now passkey costs 200,000 gas to verify on chain, but maybe in the future there can be a precompile in Ethereum and then also in Luxor that allows you to have your passkey keys to control your profile.
[4881.4s] So you can build anything you can think of on top of universal profiles, anything.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4887.6s] Yeah, no, this is amazing.
[4889.3s] Um, okay.
[4890.4s] My final question is, uh, you know, given, you know, your involvement in the creation of the ERC 725 and, and, and, you know, the beginning days of Ethereum, um, could you maybe elaborate on how the ERC 725 standard benefits both Luxo and Ethereum ecosystems?
[4912.6s] you know, especially in terms of like, you know, identity management and on-chain interaction and how you see there could be synergy there so that both chains can grow and get better and the space can get better.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4923.4s] So Universal Profiles is a generic smart contract standard.
[4927.9s] That means it out of the box works on every EVM chain.
[4931.5s] Except if you want to have all the user experience and the bells and whistles, you need a few more things.
[4936.6s] You need obviously a browser extension that we built and you need
[4939.7s] a transaction relay service if you want to have, you know, gasless experiences or very smooth onboarding.
[4945.7s] And you need a few other things.
[4948.0s] But apart from that, the standard itself works.
[4951.0s] We are currently working on making universal profiles work also on Ethereum.
[4956.1s] So that means we open our browser extension for Ethereum and potentially other chains as well.
[4960.5s] And we basically allowing then your profile that you already have in Luxor that you can cross-chain deploy it on, you know, any of the other networks as well.
[4970.2s] On the end, ultimately, every chain will benefit from universal profiles or ES75 accounts, obviously, because they're a generic smart contract account, right?
[4979.9s] That is just useful to have anywhere.
[4983.5s] I personally, maybe the benefit you get being on Luxor is Luxor has not only invented this smart contract account, but we also made all the other standards work very smoothly and nicely together.
[4997.1s] Like, they're better to work with.
[4999.2s] they are more flexible in what they can do, and they are very harmoniously working with universal profiles that creates a more decentralized on-chain experience.
[5009.7s] That's why Luxo is the better place to build it on.
[5013.2s] It can be used in any other chain as well, but because you have the network effect on those chains, and because they're using ESC20 and all the other stuff, it doesn't flourish as much, let's say, as it does on Luxo.
[5028.4s] It's like if you have a modern car and you go on a shitty road, then it doesn't drive so well.
[5034.4s] So you want to be on a great road too.
[5037.3s] So you want to have the whole package, not the half package, let's say.
[5041.8s] But you can have the smart car account will totally benefit.
[5045.7s] any
[5060.9s] It's not a smart contract account in that sense.
[5063.9s] It's a multi-sig, right?
[5065.5s] You don't have a permission system on this.
[5067.3s] You cannot attach information to a Knossos safe.
[5070.1s] It's a multi-sig, right?
[5071.9s] And you can actually put a multi-sig, you could put a Knossos safe in front of a universal profile and now you can even use it as a company account or a company profile.
[5082.8s] Or you can put a voting contract in front of a universal profile and you have a DAO.
[5087.0s] And now you have the benefit of not only having a DAO where you can vote, but you have a DAO that has a profile picture, a website that can be community governed, the information that's attached to this DAO profile.
[5097.6s] And you can literally do, you know, manage that whole profile, you know, as a community, you know, in a decentralized fashion, uh, with even subgroups having separate permissions where they could steer a portion of the money separately from what the people are voting on.
[5110.9s] It's, it's not all possible because of the standard, you know, that is out now, but yeah, it needs some interest understanding and learning a little bit if you really want to do very sophisticated things, but if you just want to use it as a wallet.
[5124.9s] It needs no learning at all.
[5126.8s] It just works out of the box like any EOA.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5130.6s] Yeah, no, this is, this is honestly amazing.
[5134.2s] I think I'm a luxo maxi now.
[5136.3s] Um, uh, it's, it's really, obviously for the more public side of the things, there's always going to be, you know, um, the use cases for the privacy and whatnot.
[5147.8s] And that's, that's fine.
[5149.6s] But, um, you know, in this space with so many bad actors, I feel like these universal profiles are actually very important because
[5160.2s] It's just going to keep getting worse and worse unless there's something put in place to mitigate these bad actors.
[5167.3s] And I think that starts with something like Universal Profiles, where there's actually some data to go off of inside of these profiles.
[5178.0s] And that's honestly what I'm building and I'm seeing.
[5181.3s] you know, the synergy here and, you know, potentially, you know, me and your team could jump on a call or something and figure out how we could get this over to Luxo.
[5190.4s] But I'm super excited about it and going to dive a bit more into the tech with my developers.
[5197.4s] But, yeah, I truly appreciate you jumping on the call and telling us about the past, you know, what you're working on now.
[5205.0s] And I really appreciate it.
[5207.5s] I mean, if you want to take a couple more questions from anybody that wants to come up, I will, if you want to.
[5214.3s] Just going to warn everybody that we want to be respectful here as well.
[5218.9s] But if you're all set, I'm good.
[5222.0s] I really appreciate everything that you've, the knowledge that you've bestowed upon us here.
[5229.1s] I appreciate it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5232.2s] Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to talk about a bit of the history.
[5235.7s] I mean, obviously, this is what we are right now, the situation that we are facing on Luxor is every time we talk to people and every time we explain it, you know, everybody realize, oh my God, this is the big shit.
[5247.3s] What we have right now, the biggest problem with that we are not having enough attention.
[5252.2s] and not enough attention on like what it really is.
[5255.0s] People, you know, that have heard about Lux in the past, they kind of put it into a box of some fashion chain not relevant to them.
[5262.5s] We have literally built the most important, you know, foundation for blockchain going forward probably.
[5268.7s] I mean, there's nothing comparable existing and now it needs
[5272.5s] To spread, you know, the knowledge and the idea needs to spread.
[5275.6s] That's the most important aspect that needs to happen.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5278.1s] I mean, honestly, that's where I see a social 5 product coming in to onboard users.
[5285.7s] That is just, I mean, you could see what happened with Bass last year, where
[5290.7s] First off, BASE is Coinbase, so it's going to attract users, period.
[5296.1s] But everybody saw the huge uptick in BASE once Frentech was added to it.
[5302.8s] And from my understanding of the technology and everything that we talked about here,
[5307.9s] you're literally your your chain is literally geared perfectly for a social five product if you could get a social five product on luxo that um yeah i mean on on boards users has some sort of air drop campaign
[5323.5s] brother, you'll see the people flock over there easily because first off, everybody loves free money, you know, free, free money, which is, you know, good and stuff.
[5332.9s] But what, if you build a good product, they come for the free money, but then they stay, they stay because the product's good.
[5339.5s] You know, there's a lot of opportunities you people are seeing from luck so that you're, Oh, look at these universal profiles.
[5346.5s] I could actually follow them.
[5347.6s] I could see what this guy's doing.
[5349.3s] Oh,
[5349.5s] He's a good actor, he's a bad actor, oh he just shilled this but then dumped it 15 minutes later.
[5356.1s] These are problems in the space that specifically Luxo can help mitigate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5362.3s] I love it.
[5363.9s] I mean, there's maybe one thing I want to add to this is that it is a bit more, so we didn't just want to create one kind of app, you know, like a Forecaster or like a Frentech or whatever, where it just does one thing and it does this and then they need to kind of add a bit more features here and there.
[5380.5s] We created the foundation for any of those things.
[5383.4s] Any of those things, Forecaster, Frentech, anything, if they would switch to Universal Profiles, they can like throw away 30% of their app.
[5390.2s] systems and make it a lot easier for themselves and for everyone else because that stuff plugs perfectly into a profile.
[5397.9s] You don't even need, like everybody reinvented the account because they didn't have an account, right?
[5401.6s] And then they tried to figure out how to connect the wallet of a user to it.
[5404.9s] We have that built that you can now like literally have out of the box and you can just plug and care about what you actually want to build, which is your app, right?
[5411.9s] And not the account system.
[5413.3s] So the account system is not there.
[5416.2s] But it is built so much more on a ground level, hence why it allows everything, that now anybody can come and build like the follower system or whatever else on top of this.
[5426.4s] And then, yes, and then it becomes not only one new app, it becomes basically a foundation for a decentralized social.
[5434.5s] Decentralized social means that anybody can come and help build the pieces of the social network.
[5440.0s] It's not one social network.
[5441.6s] The network is the social network itself and everybody can build an aspect of it and there can be many windows into the same social network and then you get all of what you said, you know, the transparency and all of the stuff.
[5453.1s] And yeah, that's not possible because the accounting is
[5458.0s] That's solved and that was the most important thing to solve.
[5461.9s] But when it comes to questions, I'm happy to take a question.
[5465.6s] By the way, one thing also, Skima, who is here a listener in there,
[5471.0s] He can happily help.
[5473.2s] He's one of our smart corner devs.
[5474.5s] He can happily help with explaining to your team how stuff works if you have a question.
[5479.0s] But really important is go to the docs.lux.tech.
[5483.1s] They have pretty much every knowledge there.
[5486.1s] We are constantly working on improving them to make them even more digestible, even more readable and simpler because obviously it's a lot to take in if you want to try everything.
[5495.3s] But most people don't even need to understand
[5500.4s] 90% of it, you know, what's in there because your apps just work out of the box and you can go feature by feature, whatever you need, you can go figure out how would I do this in your profiles and you will find a way.
[5511.4s] So you don't need to learn all the standards and then go build.
[5514.3s] You can literally go step by step and you'd literally need to know nothing to just get started.
[5519.0s] Connecting your profile is connecting the same as like a wallet.
[5523.0s] Um, and you can grow from there and it's fairly simple.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5528.7s] Amazing, man.
[5529.5s] I really,
[5530.5s] I really learned a lot.
[5531.6s] I appreciate it.
[5532.7s] Um, I will be in contact if that's okay with you just to maybe bounce some ideas around.
[5538.6s] Um, but, uh, I, yeah, I really appreciate this.
[5541.3s] I would love to get another spaces where it's you and potentially Alex Andre, if you would, you know, be willing to do that maybe in, um, uh, you know, a couple of weeks down the line, a month or so, give a little break here.
[5553.5s] But, um, yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[5556.5s] Um, I don't see any hands up if anybody wanted to ask a question.
[5560.4s] But yeah, thank you very much.
[5562.7s] I had a great time talking to you.
[5564.9s] And we'll be in touch, man.
[5566.9s] I appreciate what you're doing for the space and what you've done for the space.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5571.0s] Yeah, thank you so much as well.
[5572.4s] I mean, happy to join in a call with Alexander Afsa.
[5577.6s] I haven't been in a public Twitter space, I guess, ever.
[5582.2s] So it will be definitely fun.
[5584.9s] If anybody has a question, then feel free.
[5587.6s] By the way, maybe one other thing.
[5588.8s] You talked about airdrops and stuff.
[5590.8s] We're working on an airdrop bar, so basically a tool that anybody can just come and scan all the newest profiles out there, give it certain metrics, what they want to see, hey, has it interacted with this token or has it interacted with this protocol, or was created from then to then, or has so and so many transactions made or gas used, and then basically get the list of the profiles out and drop them whatever you like.
[5616.9s] Basically, it's a generic tool for anybody to create
[5619.7s] you know, to airdrop stuff, um, which, um, welcome to the world of spamming, I guess.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5627.5s] I mean, it's, it's an attention economy, like you saying, and, uh, you gotta grab people's attention.
[5633.6s] And unfortunately, not unfortunately, but

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5636.1s] less a little unfortunately that money is you know money speaks all so yeah yeah i mean this is definitely uh i mean the airdrop tool would be fun um we also will probably use it ourselves i mean this is really we build it for ourselves but it's very generically usable for other people and we have already a lot of nft projects on luxo we have a lot of meme coins on luxo there's already quite a social community and the cool thing is if you go to universe profile.cloud
[5664.9s] You can see the profiles.
[5666.7s] You can see the activity.
[5667.9s] You can see what's happening on chain.
[5669.5s] You can see what people collect It's already a social space and a social chain By default because everybody is a profile Hence why it's the account obstruction Shane, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5681.5s] And you know, hey you could take that I'm not trademarking none, but yeah I
[5689.6s] Yeah, this was great.
[5691.3s] I appreciate you.
[5692.7s] And we'll be in touch.
[5694.4s] I got some ideas for Luxo.
[5696.4s] We'll bounce them back off each other.
[5698.8s] So if nobody has any questions, which it doesn't look like it, I'm going to close it up.
[5703.2s] Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[5704.5s] Thanks, Fabian.
[5706.8s] Have a good day, guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5708.5s] Thank you, guys.
[5709.1s] Thanks, everybody.
