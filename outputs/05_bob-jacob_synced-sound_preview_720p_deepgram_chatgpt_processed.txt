**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] So hello?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Hello, Bob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:02] So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:07] And I have here Jacob.
[00:09] Goodenough.
[00:10] Goodenough.
[00:12] Yes, there you go.

[00:14] So yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:17] I think we did meet in Bogota for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:23] I was not aware of your background and role, but yeah, specifically, you were an intern at the dev office in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:33] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:37] Oh yeah. Thank you for the intro, and good question.
[00:40] Yeah, it was in Bogotá. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then, but yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian—Florian Glatz maybe—and talking about the old days.
[00:51] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.

[00:57] And, yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client, back starting September—or August—2015.
[01:05] I think it was maybe August to December?
[01:07] Yeah. It was August to December.
[01:09] I think it was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched.
[01:12] And the first week I was there was when there was the first big fork, where the Go client forked from the—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:17] —C++ and Python client.
[01:19] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:20] Yes. And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:24] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.
[01:27] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:33] And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, “No. We can't do this,” because there were so many people who were just looking, and some started leaving.
[01:42] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum—one that I had given a couple of weeks before, back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:50] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:52] Yeah. I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I had started a Copenhagen Ethereum Meetup group.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:57] Oh goodness. So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:00] I know exactly when it started. It started on 07/14/2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:04] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:05] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying Computer Science.
[02:09] I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:13] So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:16] No. It was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:23] Oh, I see.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:25] So I had graduated? Yeah, but just a bachelor.
[02:28] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:33] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:34] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:37] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:42] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:43] So yeah, I’ve known of Ethereum since 2014.
[02:47] But anyway, we wrote this bachelor thesis—me and two of my friends—and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.
[02:56] I was the only one—like, I was tired of studying already, even after a bachelor—and the other two guys wanted to continue.
[03:01] So I was like, “Okay, I’m going to do this.”

[03:03] A couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.
[03:08] That was a very interesting time. Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn’t write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
[03:17] But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[03:20] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:22] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?
[03:28] But also Felix Lange—I know—was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:31] Yeah, there were some different people out there.
[03:33] He was doing Go stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:35] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
[03:37] I think they were under the C++ team at the time.
[03:39] But they were there. And Remix as well—well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:43] And I also remember Mist, I guess.
[03:45] At least Fabian was also around. So there was a good amount of different people around.
[03:49] And also, quite often, people would come and visit from other places.

[03:53] I remember a couple of times Christophe Jentzsch came to visit.
[03:56] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight, or something like that, and there was no one else at the office.
[04:02] And I was doing my internship.
[04:04] I think he wrote in the late afternoon on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:09] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:10] So I was just like, “Oh, it's fine.”
[04:12] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:15] I had the smallest room—just a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.
[04:18] Yeah. So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office.

[04:22] I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.
[04:27] So yeah, I had one night where I let him into the office at midnight, and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:33] I got to know him. He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:37] Right. It was quite interesting.
[04:39] And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn’t it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:41] Right. If I remember correctly, he was building a lot of, like, just JSON data that they fed to the client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:46] And that was from the C++ client. I know that C++ Ethereum was leading—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:50] And the tests were generated from that, but then run against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:54] That sounds about right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:56] But yeah, there are a lot of small stories.
[04:58] You told me we don’t have too much time. I’ll try to keep it short.

[05:01] But if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was being lucky enough to participate in Devcon 1 and also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time.
[05:12] Because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:14] Yep, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:15] —and the C++ team was kind of cut off.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:17] And you also had, you know, Ming Chan. Her first official date was August 1, 2015.
[05:22] So, yeah, you basically had those cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend.
[05:27] It had been going for a year.
[05:28] It was the July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale.
[05:32] But nearly all of the money was gone in that year.
[05:34] And I think that was also maybe not the most responsible...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:38] ...usage of money. But also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.
[05:42] The Ether price itself—I think it dipped below the presale price at some point in...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:46] That’s right. September, year-end. And you had no accumulation.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:49] Yep. But yeah, I didn’t have any interactions with Ming back then.
