**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Okay, welcome everyone.
[00:03] We have a very special topic today.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:15] You can find me usually on Twitter for the Ethereum people, c h r. Of course, I have a complicated name, not many vocals in there, but you find it.
[00:36] Or, of course, on LinkedIn. Actually, for my company, I'm more active on LinkedIn, which I was never before.
[01:02] That's what's where we get our clients as tokenize it.

[03:40] Thanks so much.
[03:42] Have a great day.
[03:44] Thank you.
[03:46] Too.
[03:48] It was great talking to you.
[03:50] Bye bye.
[03:52] Bye.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:57] Me too.
[03:59] I'm looking forward to it.
[04:01] And as of now, I don't intend any change.
[04:05] Stick to Ethereum.
[04:08] I love the community.
[04:12] Continue building and try to get a lot of people using it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:23] Have you been to every DevCon?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:27] Yes.
[04:29] I've been to every DevCon. The last one was actually the first one that I didn't give a talk, and I also went to every ECC except of one that was COVID. There was some reason I couldn't come.
[05:13] But yes, I'm actually intending to continue coming through every dev con. It's like you meet the people like, of course, and many others. It's just a sweet spirit there, nice community. Love seeing how it all grows. Listen to those exciting talks.
[06:25] I mean, it's for tokenizers, it's not as relevant. It's not like our customers or it's tech, of course. We're just doing an ERC 20 token on Ethereum. It's super easy.
[07:18] So deep tech. Sometimes I miss doing deep tech, but well, I just enjoy being there, seeing what it all what all happened.
[08:35] And remembering those magic days, and just like only once in a lifetime or two times in a lifetime, you have this moment where everything comes together at the right time, the right place, the right people. This certainly was one of those moments for me.
[10:27] Those one and a half years I worked for Ethereum are definitely the prime of my career in terms of who I worked with, what we accomplished, the impact we had on the world, and the sweet cyberpunk spirit there and what we did there. It was really great.
[13:45] I always sometimes get emotional thinking about this and meeting those people again at DEFCON.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[14:17] Fantastic.
[14:19] Well, thank you for all your contributions to that success.
[14:26] Likewise. All the best.
