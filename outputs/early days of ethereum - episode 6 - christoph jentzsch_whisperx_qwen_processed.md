**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Okay, welcome everyone.
[00:03] We have a very special topic today.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:05] Welcome to the session with Chris.
[00:08] Let's get started.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] So, Chris, can you start by telling us a bit about your background and how you got involved in Ethereum?

**CHRIS:**
[00:15] Sure.
[00:17] I first heard about Bitcoin around 2013 or so, but it was Ethereum that really caught my attention when Vitalik Buterin introduced the concept of a Turing-complete blockchain.
[00:26] In late 2014, I joined the Ethereum Foundation as a developer and worked on various projects like Swarm and Sharding.
[00:35] Then in early 2016, I started working with Slock.it, which was one of the first companies to build real-world applications using Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:42] That's an impressive start. Can you tell us about some of your key projects and milestones during this time?

**CHRIS:**
[01:00] Absolutely.
[01:03] One of the early highlights was when I helped organize DevCon 1 in London, which was a pivotal moment for Ethereum's community growth.
[01:12] Another significant project was Gnosis Safe, an advanced multi-signature wallet that we built to enhance security and usability on Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:24] That sounds like quite the journey. What were some of the challenges you faced along the way?

**CHRIS:**
[01:35] There were definitely a lot of technical hurdles, especially in the early days.
[01:40] One major challenge was scaling Ethereum to handle more transactions without compromising decentralization or security.
[01:49] Another issue was ensuring that developers had easy-to-use tools and frameworks to build on top of Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:58] It's amazing how much has changed since then. Can you talk about some recent developments in your career?

**CHRIS:**
[02:06] Sure.
[02:09] After leaving Slock.it, I worked for a short time at Blockchain LLC under Jeff Burns before starting my own venture studio called Corpus Ventures.
[02:18] We've been working on several projects including EM3, a decentralized messaging protocol, and GasHawk, which helps users save transaction costs on Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:29] That's quite an array of projects. Can you tell us more about Tokenize It?

**CHRIS:**
[02:35] Definitely.
[02:38] Tokenize It is essentially a Web3-based Angel List for Europe, where startups can tokenize their shares and raise funds both privately and publicly using stable coins on Ethereum.
[02:49] Our platform is completely non-custodial, meaning users control their own tokens in Gnosis Safe wallets.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:00] That sounds like a significant achievement. What are your goals for the future?

**CHRIS:**
[03:06] My goal is to continue building and expanding Tokenize It across Europe, making Web3 technology more accessible to startups and investors outside of our bubble.
[03:17] I'm also looking forward to attending DEF CON 8 and continuing my involvement with the Ethereum community.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:24] Fantastic. We're excited to see what you have in store for us.
[03:29] Where can people find out more about your work?

**CHRIS:**
[03:35] You can usually find me on Twitter at C-H-R-Y-E-N-G or on LinkedIn, where I'm more active these days as we focus on getting clients and expanding Tokenize It.
[03:48] Thanks for having me today.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:51] Thank you so much, Chris. Have a great day.

**CHRIS:**
[03:56] You too. It was great talking to you.
[03:59] Bye.
