**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] So, hello.
[00:02] Hello, Bob.
[00:03] So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:08] And I have here Jakub Ciepluch.
[00:10] Good enough.
[00:11] Good enough.
[00:12] Ciepluch.
[00:13] Yes, there you go.
[00:14] So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:17] I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:21] I was not aware of your background and role, but...
[00:24] But yeah, specifically, you were an intern at DEV in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:28] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:32] Oh, yeah.
[00:33] Thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:35] It was in Bogotá.
[00:36] I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
[00:40] But yeah, I think…
[00:41] You were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz maybe, and talking about the old days.
[00:45] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.
[00:51] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client,
[00:54] back starting September or August 2015.
[00:57] I think it was like—
[00:58] Maybe August to December?
[00:59] Yeah, it was August to December.
[01:01] It was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched, and the first week I was there was when there was like the first
[01:06] big fork, where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:10] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:12] Yes.
[01:13] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:15] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:18] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:19] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:24] And eventually I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people just looking.
[01:29] Some started leaving.
[01:30] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:36] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:38] Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:42] Oh, goodness.
[01:43] So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:45] I know exactly when it started.
[01:46] It started on the 14th of July 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:48] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:49] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:52] Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:53] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:57] So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:59] No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:04] I see.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:05] Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:07] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:08] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:10] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:11] I—
[02:12] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:15] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that.
[02:19] I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014, but anyway.
[02:22] We wrote the bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the foundation, and then we got offered internships.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:29] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:30] And I was the only one.
[02:32] I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue, so I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[02:37] And a couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:42] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:43] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[02:46] Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
[02:52] But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[02:56] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

[02:58] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:03] But also Felix Lange I know was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:05] Yeah, there were some different people.
[03:07] I remember Gustav Simonsson, I think he was doing Go stuff.
[03:09] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
[03:11] I think they were under the C++ team back then, but they were there.
[03:14] And Remix as well—well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:17] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:18] And I also remember The Mist, I guess.
[03:20] At least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around.
[03:22] So there was a good amount of different people around.
[03:24] And also, quite often people would come and visit from other places.
[03:27] I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.
[03:30] There was one time where—
[03:32] I think he arrived at midnight or something like that.
[03:34] And there was no one else at the office.
[03:36] I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon.
[03:39] He wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.

[03:44] So I was just like, oh, it's fine. I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[03:47] I had the smallest room, just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.
[03:51] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office and I actually had like—
[03:54] I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:58] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:59] Yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:03] I got to know him.
[04:04] He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.
[04:07] It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:08] And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:10] Yeah, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:14] And that was from the C++ client, I know, that cpp-ethereum was leading.
[04:18] And the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:22] Yeah, that sounds about right.
[04:23] There are a lot more stories. You told me we don’t have too much time. I’ll try to keep it short.
[04:27] I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like—
[04:30] Of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:33] Right, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:34] And also experiencing the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time, because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:38] Yeah, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:39] And the C++ team was kind of cut off.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:41] And you also had, you know, Ming Chan — her first official day was 1st of August of 2015.

[04:46] So yeah, you basically had those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend where—
[04:50] It had been going for a year.
[04:52] It was July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale, but nearly all of the money was gone in that year.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:58] Yeah, and I think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage of money.
[05:03] But also, the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:05] Yeah, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:06] And the Ether price itself was also—
[05:08] I think it dipped below the pre-sale price at some point in September 2015.
[05:11] A year in, and you had no accumulation.
[05:13] But yeah, I didn’t have any interactions with Ming back then.
[05:15] Actually, one thing I just remembered now—
[05:17] I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London, but a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can’t do it anymore because we don’t have the money.
