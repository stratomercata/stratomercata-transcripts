**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay. We are live, and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane. Welcome, John Crane.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:15] Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Hey. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:20] John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:32] Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, I let's see. My crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met, at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there. Yeah. I was, you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.

[01:02] And, yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were, a little bit past, you know, finance and trading. And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So, yeah, it doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:28] Yeah. Remember—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:30] How you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but, like, what was that—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:38] Yeah. Well?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:40] Your, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:42] So I was, I was kinda hanging— okay. I was wrong. Like, this is actually super cool. Like, you know, I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing. And I was just, like, googling Ethereum blockchain hackathon. I was, like, trying to find, like, get deeper involved. You know, I was trying like, quit my day job and go full time crypto. And so then I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh, shit. There's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied, with Charles. And then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:18] Yeah. And to be clear, you, to let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project, and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in web three. Right? We gave you the—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:32] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Exactly. Yeah. I think the, like, the Monday after— I don't know. Like, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on BlockApps. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:45] Well, I we, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:50] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:52] I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:55] Transition period while—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:58] You know? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was, like, we started, like, hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full time. So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:08] So with Counterparty, you could have been on.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:12] Yeah. Exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:15] So what inspired SuperRare? Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But, you know, what triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is what for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:38] Yeah. I, well, I mean, it was super interesting. Right? You know, like, we were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office or, like, know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there. And, like, watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I met— me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC-20 tokens, and, like, I found it was, like, super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard— like, you know, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code.

[04:12] But, like, the adoption created this— like, yeah, there's massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for, you know, humans and the economy. Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen.

[04:30] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all, you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata. So, like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, like— I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the, you know, the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs.

[05:05] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, like, know, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were, you know, looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the, you know, the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets, and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art. So it's kinda like the marriage of, you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:40] And, like, what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion? Because you guys— like, I know for a long time you were building, and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going? And, you know, the— like, no one is really paying attention. And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:02] It was absolutely crazy. It was hard to be like— it's just, like, completely surreal the whole time. Like, it felt like a dream. Like, we, you know, we started in 2018. We were— we tried to raise money. It never really worked. Like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and, like, making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:25] So that's the best situation to possibly be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:28] Yeah. It was, like, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea. So it was, yeah, it was like, you know, it was a grind. It was super volatile many times. I was just like, what am I doing with my life?

[06:45] But, yeah, then it just really started, like— I remember the numbers were, like, doubling every month for a while. Like, remember it was October 2020. It was our first million dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild. You know? Because but, you know, twelve months ago, we were like, alright. So the volume was, like, $5,000, and we made a couple hundred dollars. Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:12] Yeah. And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform? I think, like, we were trying to talk about that, actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:20] Yeah. We— yeah. We were the first to come— like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but, like, we were the first to combine, like, the minting and the marketplace experience. So it was like, there weren't, like, great minting tools then. So we're like, we started with the minting tool, and then we're like, alright. I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll, like, we'll build the marketplace too. And, you know, it's partially just out of necessity because, like, the tooling sucked at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:50] Yeah. It's funny because I remember, if you recall, the— what later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties. They were based in Vancouver, and I was, like— talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time.

[08:08] But and, I mean, you've done so much. One of the amazing things that it's the launch of the RARE token, and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality? Like, how— you know, what led to that, and how did that go? Like, how— you know, what did you figure out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[08:32] Yeah. I mean, you know, early on, I was, like, part of, like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where, you know, the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network. You know, like, there's the, you know, like, the fat protocol article that was, you know, super popular, like, 2016. So just, like, thinking about, like, okay. What does monetization look like?

[09:00] And, you know, can you build platforms that are, you know, like— they're more, like, collaborative than extractive, where it's like, you know, if you're Meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and, you know, sell ads, you know, which is a great business. But, partially, for me, it was almost like a, you know, a thought experiment of, like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be, like— maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kinda it's, like, collective ownership via the token.

[09:35] So, yeah, I was, you know, drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:40] Did you trust that? I still am. Yeah. I guess to be—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:45] Yeah. Yeah. But—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[09:47] Did you do it, like, classic ICO style? Was there, like, fixed price auction? How did it— how did the RARE get in there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:55] Yeah. We actually just did a huge airdrop. Probably one of our mistakes, yeah, is, like, so, like, we should've probably, you know, sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away. And yeah. I mean, yeah, there's plenty of challenges to, like— you know, DAOs are hard to manage and run.

[10:15] But, yeah, it's cool to see the current administration kinda, like, change tack and actually seem like they're interested in, like, building and pushing forward. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[10:25] What do you think the biggest challenge was in— what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO? Because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto Kool-Aid, you know, running things completely decentralized. What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[10:48] Yeah. I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory. Regulatory. Like, you have— you know, like, you're kinda, like, trying to read the tea leaves, and then rather than just making, like, the bet you're like, okay. Well, this is the simplest, best decision. You're like, okay. Well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this. And, like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment?

[11:15] And it's obviously— you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules. You know, it's like— the— Do you think— like, the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:28] The dark— the dark ages. You know? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:32] Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he? You know? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[11:38] Man. Do you think of it more like the advice? Do you think of it more like it should be, like, a representative democracy? Like, should be, like, passing bills in there? I think they're, like, the proposals and there's, like, delegation usually is the model for it. Yeah. Could also be, like, just, like, you got a couple leaders, but the stake could call, you know, confidence vote or something or, like, people like too. I haven't tried it yet, but, looks like, like, MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[12:08] I think and I think it kinda depends on, like, specifically what you're doing. You know, if it's something like, you know— I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just, you know, where it's, like, if small changes can have potentially, like, catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing. If, you know, it's— you know, like, SuperRare, it's, like, if there's a— there's a low level protocol and there's application and, like, you know, other than, like, the escrow contracts for auctions and things, like, the stakes are, like, fairly low.

[12:42] I do kinda like the idea of, like, you'd sorta like— if you can empower, like, a team or a few individuals to kinda just keep going, and then the token holders can say, like, tell people to stop versus, like, having to approve everything. Like, that's a very silly arduous process. And I feel like it should be more like, okay. If you're— it's, like, veering off in the wrong direction, you can— like, there's a way to kinda, like, raise your voice and have influence. But, like, you know, having a vote on, like, what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:18] I'm curious, like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance, like, being a curated kind of platform and being open? You know? Like, how do you think about those two? Because I think one of the advantages of SuperRare with the curation side and art, you keep the quality very, very high. And— yeah. Unlike, you know, more marketplace type NFT platforms, which just frankly puts a ton of crap, like, out there. So— yeah. How do you balance those two? I— keep decentralized, do you think?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:52] Yeah. No. It— yeah. I mean, it's kinda challenging, and it's almost, almost a paradox. But I think, you know, we've kind of always taken the, like, minimal decentralization. So it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then, you know, like, one example is, like, we were, like, talking about, like, token models early on. I was like, maybe we'll have token holders vote on artists. And I was just like, that sounds like the most dramatic, terrible thing I could ever imagine. You know? It's like people voting, like, your art's terrible. Like, you know, like, oh my word.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[14:25] I mean, in the pumped up fun streamer heyday, I think that it could have really worked during that period of time. Exact— yeah. You know, maybe we have people stream.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:35] Yeah. It's, like, live going. Like, is the art good or bad? Watch this artist—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:40] Threaten to commit suicide. I did do a stalk on a dating project once where you basically had to be voted in based on your looks, which does seem horrible. I can see. Very, very evil. You know? Like— But there's right now, ten pages. Remember those? Yes. Yes. Or Hot or Not or all of those— Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's— Yeah. Yeah. Just brutal. But I— and, yeah, especially in places— you know, the art industry can be quite vicious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:12] Yeah. It's challenging and, you know, art— like, good art is subjective. So that, you know, it's like— I feel like, you know, like, the on-chain auctions, escrow on-chain, that makes a lot of sense. Like, on-chain voting for, like, which artists are good. You know, that's kinda, like, let people who are, like, making decisions, like, do their thing. And then if it starts to be, you know, like, if things get out of hand, maybe, like, the token holders can, like, you know, raise awareness. But— yeah. Yeah.

[15:45] That was, like, the— and, like, part of it too— I mean, actually, early on, we were, like— thought we would be more of an open platform. And then as things progressed, there were more tools. Like, you know, we were just trying— it was like, we were building things, trying to add value, and there's a ton of open tooling. So, like, early on, we kinda thought we might have, like, SuperRare as, like, the ultra curated view into the market, and then maybe you have, like, you know, another kinda, like, open platform that's anyone could use. But—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:18] I'm curious. Like, what was the— like, what— like, you know, it's a two-sided market with artists and art buyers. Like, what do you think— like, did you have to get the artist first to convince them, and how did you do that, or did you have to get the art first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:35] Yeah. We— you know, you kinda had to get both first. So, I mean, we started, like, just, you know, out of, like— it really started as just me kinda, like, experimenting and building. And so we were, like— you know, started with the minting tools. I was going around, like, demoing, talking to people.

[16:55] And I guess we— it first kinda piqued interest of the artist. Like, I was— you know, like, we were, like, talking about how it would work. And then when we first launched, though, we kinda had— so there's Jason Bailey, who was kinda like an early, you know, digital art advocate. He— you know, big writer. He ran a company or runs a company called Club NFT that does, like, NFT art backups. Yeah.

[17:22] And he hit us up and was like, hey, guys. Like, you know, we've been talking to him, and he was like, I know you're gonna close with your products. Like, I wanna buy this art on Monday. Can we— can I do it on SuperRare? And I, like, looked at Charlie, and I was like, dude, Jason wants to, you know, buy something on mainnet on Monday. Like, what can we do? Like, that was— That was— in, like, we had, like, thirty-six hours that Charlie was like, yeah. Probably.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:52] And so then we basically stayed up for thirty-six hours, fixing bugs. And I'm getting— I'm getting flashbacks to when Microsoft said we wanna launch blockchain as a service with you at DEVCON one, and we were like—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:05] Exactly. There are many parallels. Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[18:10] Oh my god. Like, that's like— Nothing like a good deadline to get, you know— Exactly. Like— Especially with a big, you know, major—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:18] Partner that, you know, can make or break you. Right? So— Yeah. Just don't have live demos on the end of all of that as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:26] Well, yeah. Exactly. That's when it gets real risky. We actually— so when we did it, there was a— there was a funny bug with the, like, the React stuff. So we're, like, live, like, helping— we were, like, live streaming or not live streaming, but, like, screen sharing the transaction with this artist, Robbie Barrat, and Jason. And we're, like, literally pushing fixes. It was like, oh, we didn't— didn't expect that to happen. Like, okay. One second. Like, alright. It's deployed. Just reload the page.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[18:55] Lots of cache clearing in— Exactly. I don't remember about that. I— you know, like, I'm curious what you see as the future of just generally, like, art and NFTs, like, you know—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[19:08] Can I jump in on this? Yeah. Please. Give— take a take on it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:12] So in DeFi, we're starting to see— like, as the administration has cleared the way to some extent—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[19:20] It seems like, you know, there was a pent up demand for something like a TradFi, DeFi merger. It's not all the way there yet, but it's, you know, getting to just be FI. Like, I see the path to that— Yeah. Happening.

[19:35] Do you think, like, it's— NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever? I know, you know, maybe you could talk about your gallery. I know you started to do a lot of, like, physical sales. Yeah. Etcetera. Like, does it kinda— what— or, you know, do they merge? Do they not? Do they— Yeah. That does—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:55] Like, chart by— like, chart art become NFT art and digital art? Or like— Yeah. I— you know, I— like, the NFT stuff, I do think kinda just, like, eventually fades into the background. Like, the real zero to one is, you know, cryptographically secure provenance. So, you know, you could use that for physical art. You could use it for digital. I think it was, like, more of a breakthrough with digital because you can kinda argue the token is the art. You now have this, you know, more liquid asset.

[20:28] So for art specifically, yeah, it's kinda just becoming part of the market, and I think you'll see NFTs, you know, used with digital art, obviously, but also with physical art. Like, no one's really— if you like— the lack of good data on provenance in the art market and, like, collectibles in general is, like, kind of amazing. Like, it's still like, oh, there's a sticker on the back that this, you know, says it was from this gallery. Probably it was. Like, probably it was? Like, nobody knows.

[21:00] And so and, also, I think, you know, like, a lot of people are, like, really trying to tie the physical asset to the digital asset, which I think is a waste of time personally. It's like, if you have the physical asset and you also have custody of the certificate of authenticity, like, that's kinda good enough. You don't really need some complicated tech solution there.

[21:22] And it's hard to imagine a world in which, you know, like, collectors and, like, customers— like, you just want— like, I personally have, like, a higher perceived value for physical art that also has an NFT with it. Yeah. And I think in general, that trend continues.

[21:42] So I think digital art will kinda just become a bigger part of the contemporary art market, and then eventually, we'll see NFTs used as certificates of authenticity, you know, for all, you know, high value objects.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[21:58] Yeah. I mean, one of the big things I didn't realize is that a friend of mine is an artist, and she often gets a request, like, for the value that was paid for because someone wants to insure it. Right? And, like— Yeah. We— like, there's this whole downstream kind of economy.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[22:15] Insurance, appraisal, like, lending. Like, you can't— you need much better. And so it's like— the— I mean, Kieran, you and I have talked about the lending stuff a little bit. It's like, I think the lending market for these types of assets is small just because there's not good information. You could probably really grow that pie quite a bit if you do have easier access to— Yeah. Your provenance information.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[22:40] Let me add a little on that front. So I felt having been more of an NFT style RWA marketplace for a while and gone more DeFi, we— I thought that people wanted to tokenize to sell things at first, and this is true. But I think it is better that they tokenize to unlock liquidity in— selling could be one way, but people kinda wanna hold on to stuff. Like, I don't wanna sell my ETH. I don't wanna sell my— you know, etcetera. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:08] I think that's painful.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[23:10] You would know better than us. At the very high end of the market, you know, if you get, like, a wealth manager, they'll— they might extend some credit against your Picasso, right, or what have you. But for everybody else— and you probably have to have a lot of separate money for that too. You can't really— like, I don't know if people fire sell their art, but it tends to sit there. And I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should sit there, but the credit markets actually just make it liquid, you know, as we've— as we've discussed before, which I think would be super cool. Like— Yeah. I'm surprised.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:45] We're getting into that world, but we're not— Yeah. I— we're seeing it. I feel like it's the green shoots of, okay. Here's what's possible. It totally makes sense. I think just like, NFTs almost— is— is, like— they're a great— you know, like, we've talked a lot— people in crypto love talking about identity and stuff. And, like, to me, it's like NFTs are, like, a beautiful, very simple digital identity for whatever. You can pack anything you want in that metadata. It's just, like, pack it full of stuff. It's very simple. They're unique. Point to one— they're pointers to one specific thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[24:22] Yeah. I mean, I love the way you talk about, you know, NFTs as certificates of authenticity because I didn't realize this. We looked into, like, the physical art market for a while, and, like, every auction at Sotheby's when they have a big piece, like, they have to research it effectively from scratch. Right? Like, they have to build that entire chain of provenance with every piece that they do, which is an insane amount of work every single time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:48] Yeah. It's a very high friction— like, the transactions are very, very high friction, which is good, you know, like, depending on where your position is in the market. Like, obviously, Sotheby's loves being the, you know, the keeper of all secrets and information. Okay. Cool. But I, yeah, I think that's clearly gonna be disintermediated with technology.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[25:12] Any new or maybe— are you guys, you know, just to declare war on the auction houses, houses, you know, other high end physical goods? What—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[25:22] Yeah. I mean, we're focusing— like, our expansion— like, you know, we launched the gallery earlier this year, offline gallery. It's on the Bowery, right next to the New Museum. And, you know, we're showing physical, digital art, you know, installations, you know, projections, all sorts of different things.

[25:45] And, yeah, I think, like, you know, our view— like, if you look at the models, like, they're all— like, the galleries are not doing great, you know, business wise. The auction houses are hurting. I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model. And—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[26:00] It's— stuff is so illiquid. Right? I don't mean to interrupt. Right? It's just— I think the norm is stuff sitting five years, ten years with— you know, and it's feast or famine. Like, if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:15] Yep. Just wait. Yeah. Like, 2021, people were just, you know, buying Picassos on their phones on, like, online. And—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[26:25] And crazy ape—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:27] Crazy apes. Right? So— Yeah. They all— everything. Every— know, Ether Rocks. I remember when Ether Rocks were, like, the price is exploding, and I was like, this is truly amazing. Yeah.

[26:42] But, yeah, I think, like, the models have to change. And, you know, just as, like, if you think what the Internet's done as far as, like, shopping. Right? It's like you can price compare easily on your phone in any store. Right? There's no kinda, like, price arbitrage. You're, like, you're gonna look up the price of something. You can scan something, figure, and you're, like, ask ChatGPT. What is, you know, what is this? How much should it cost?

[27:10] And so I think, like, the art world has really— it has been a, like, an insider's game of who knows who and, like, what's the real price, like, the marketed price versus, like, what was actually paid. And I think that's gonna— like, it's gonna slowly be, like, unwinding, and we'll see— we'll end up with a market structure where pricing is just much more transparent. You can see things on-chain.

[27:35] And, I mean, I think that's, you know, like, that's kinda, like, part of the opportunity is, you know, as the market becomes more efficient, we'll have the best tools to service the new structure.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[27:48] So it sounds like even the big guys want more liquidity, but they're not willing to, like, let go of their proprietary information advantage, I guess. Yeah. Is that fair to say? Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:00] And I— but it's— and I— like, that's kinda also the paradox. It's like, you'll have more liquidity if it's better access to information, but, like, you know, it's the classic— what's— the— What? Innovator's dilemma? The Innovator's Dilemma. Exactly. I was like, yeah. Tip of my tongue. Yeah. Classic Innovator's Dilemma.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:22] Well, I think some of the auction houses are even trying to offer loans to try and lock people up even longer, right, to their places.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:30] Yeah. They have— I mean, I— you know, like, they're all— Christie's and some of the— like, a lot of the big— or most of the auction houses are private. So I don't know how big their businesses are, but they do have, yep. There's, like— you know, people will, like, inherit art, and it's like they don't really care necessarily, and their adviser was like, don't sell that. You should just take out a loan. And so they do have them.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:55] But that seems like a classic conflict of interest to your point. Right? Like— like—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[29:00] Oh, we'll tell you how much it's worth, and we'll loan you based on that. Yeah. It's very one-sided, and you can't really shop it around. It's like ultra specialized information.

[29:12] Jim, did you wanna ask a question? You look like you came off mute.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[29:18] Well, it's a little bit of a different topic, but I'll throw it in right now anyway. What has been the effect for good or bad of AI on— in art on what you're doing?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[29:30] Yeah. It— I mean, as far as the startup goes, it's been great. We're like, you know, you can— we got a little robot on our Slack you can talk to that does things for you. As far as the art market goes, I think it's— all— I mean, it's also been kinda great. Like, in my mind, this is just like a, you know, it's a new tool that unlocks— create— you know, like, you can kind of, like, do different creative things. It—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[29:55] You're encouraging it then.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[29:58] Yeah. Oh, yeah. We have, like, tons of artists use AI. I mean, you know, there's also tons of artists we work with who hate it and, you know, think it's the end of all creativity. But I think just, like, you know, if you look— history— I think you— like, what it really enables is, like, somebody to do more complex things. You know, it's like where you can, like, all the grunt work you don't have to do.

[30:22] So now maybe it's instead of making one still image, you're gonna do insane world building where it's like you can go in, you can— you know, like, the art's just more interactive. And, actually, the first art we ever sold on SuperRare was kinda, like, generated via, like, GAN. It's, like, adversarial networks, like, voting on outcomes. So I think, you know, it's inevitable. It's gonna happen. It's kinda like, you know, digital cameras with the end of photography, and they obviously were not—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[30:52] But do you think, like— you know, going back to the metadata and certificates of authority that proving some part was based— you know, done by a human will be valued into—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[31:05] Our kind of— or any kind of creation going forward. Yeah. I mean, I think— yeah. Just, if you— you know, it's like— it's super amazing to see, like, the rate at which content's being created and, like, you know, people— it's like you can watch a video of, like, that person didn't actually say that, but, looks like they did.

[31:25] I think that's where, you know, like, nobody ever answers a random phone number. If someone's calling you and it's not in your phone, you're like, I literally never answered this. Like, I don't know who does that. You have to be, like, pretty insane. And so it's sorta like, you've kinda certified the, like, the numbers you know, and I think it'll end up being the same with, like, content and, like, art and stuff where it's like, if it isn't, you know, signed somehow cryptographically, you'll probably just assume it's fake. Yeah. Because there's no real way to know.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[32:00] Have you seen much interest on the Bitcoin side in terms of ordinals and inscriptions and stamps and runes? Like, how— Yeah. Is that looking?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[32:12] Yeah. We've done a couple projects on runes with artists. And, yeah, it's super interesting. You know, we're— yeah. I think there's gonna be art on many blockchains. Obviously, you know, Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most secure probably have the highest likelihood of, you know, it lasting.

[32:32] But, yeah, it's— actually, people really like ordinals. It's funny. One of the sort of paradoxes that— or, like, the funny things we ran into is, like, early on, we would talk to, like, investors, and they're like, you need to get rid of the wallet. It's too complicated.

[32:50] But, actually, it kinda ends up being this, like, you gotta know all the right terms. It's almost like you get the secret incantation. You get inducted into the club, and you know how it works. And so, like, I think people really like that ordinals are a little more complex and, like, harder to understand than NFTs on Ethereum, which is just— yeah. It's sort of that's a funny anecdote. But, yeah, they're quite popular. I, you know, I think they'll be around for a while. And—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[33:22] And, I mean, another difference you have there, right, is that they're doing the data carrying on-chain as well versus an external URL, which is another interesting difference.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[33:32] Yep. Yeah. Totally.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[33:35] I'm curious about the decision to— you know, you mentioned starting the gallery. And, like, everyone's talking about RWAs and kind of bringing real world stuff into the blockchain, but you're kind of doing the opposite. Like, what was the decision to start a physical gallery? And, you know, why did you decide that was a logical next step for you guys?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[33:58] Yeah. I mean, just— you know, it's part— it's kinda part of, like, how, you know, like, the market works. So, like, in— you know, people like getting together. And, like, a lot of the art, you know, it's like you can look at it on your phone, but if you see it, you know, on the huge projector, there's, like, you know, a 10 by 10 CRT, like, TV wall. It really looks different.

[34:25] So I think, you know, part of it is, like, it's community building. It's a space people can show up, and then part of it's, you know, like, the art really does just look different. So I think, you know, as far as, like, NFT is still— you know, people are like, okay. These are just nonsense JPEGs. They're— you know, like, it's, you know, it's Ether Rocks two point o or what I like. And so, like, it's kind of, like, telling the story to everyone else. Because at the end of the day, it's still, like— you know, it's a demand constrained market, and we're, you know, we're trying to grow the collector base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[35:02] Beyond art, what do you see as, like, the next area? Like, you know, what's the next areas that are kind of gonna need these kind of provenance or these kind of certificates of authority? I mean, I can think of a million, but I'm just curious. From your point of view, where do you see— where do you see the next elements kind of getting into it first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[35:22] Yeah. I— I mean, I think in general, it's like, you know, like, luxury assets where, like, NFTs are still more expensive to create than, like, not having one. You know, like, you just print one out, and then the ID lives in your database. Yeah.

[35:40] And it— you know, it's— and I think— but it's gonna be, like, the customers are gonna have to demand it. You know, like, a lot of, like, the brokers and folks, like, they do, their kinda, like, information advantage, and so they don't really want this to exist.

[35:55] But I think it just makes so much sense. It's just hard to imagine that it doesn't happen. So— and we're see— like, you know, there's people taking wine very seriously, issuing NFTs, and, like, you know, building secondary markets. So I think part of it's, like, an asset that's kinda fun to speculate on, but also you do— you know, like, there's, you know, a high likelihood you might, you know, have somebody send you the NFT. So, like, kinda like wine, watches. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[36:25] Handbags, I think, are a big one. Like, I—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[36:28] Handbags. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Hermès—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[36:32] One of the really popular ones right now is—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[36:35] Trading cards. So they're, like— you know, what people like is, like—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[36:40] So the Courtyard is still going. Right? The—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[36:43] I think they— Yeah. They're doing great. Yeah. It's, you know, kinda like you have the speculative aspect, but also, like, if you're a serious collector, you can, you know, get real— get real things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[36:55] Okay. Last question for you because we— unless—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[36:58] Anyone else has one. But— No. No. No. We just got a quick— for things. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[37:05] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[37:07] Is— is that— are you most excited about in any aspect of the blockchain space right now?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[37:15] Most excited— I mean, it's like— it's obviously— like we— you know, like, we've all been working on this for, like, a super long time, but I do think, like, if you look at even just, like, you know, BlackRock's putting treasuries on-chain with different partners, like, moving on-chain, like— like, everything literally is gonna become— is moving on-chain. Like, I think it's, like, that's actually finally— it used to just be, like, a mantra people would say to, like, you know, help themselves feel important.

[37:48] But, like, I think we're finally getting there. We're like, holy fuck. Like, everything is moving on-chain. Like, that's actually happening. So it's, you know, real world assets, digital assets. I think just like— yeah. The— you know, liquidity is increasing. It's— yeah. I think it's, like, generally net positive for everyone. It's— you know, it feels actually like it's finally happening. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[38:12] It's taken way longer, you know, ten years, but we're still here and we're still doing it. You know? We can make, like, a thumbnail like the wrong ball that's happening. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[38:22] We need the Mission Accomplished banner. You know? Yeah. Oh my goodness, man.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[38:28] Exactly. Well, John, thank you for your time. And as always, we're really glad that you're doing so well. And where can people find you and learn more about all the stuff you do?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[38:42] Yeah. On X, at SuperRareJohn, at SuperRare. Yeah. We're— yeah. You should also— there's currently a show at the gallery, that's wrapping up, but we have a new— there's an XCOPY show at December 10. So if anyone's in town, it's a group—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[39:02] You said gallery one more time? I missed it. First—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[39:05] Oh, yeah. Offline by SuperRare.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[39:08] Offline by SuperRare.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[39:10] Well, awesome. Thank you for joining us, and take care, everyone.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[39:15] Thank you. Thanks for having me.
