Kieren James-Lubin:
[0.0s] Alrighty, so we're on.
[3.9s] Thanks.
[5.1s] So my name is Kieren James-Lubin.
[8.1s] I'm joined by Jim—or James—from OCR and Victor Wong.
[13.4s] We are old friends.
[15.3s] We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[23.8s] We're actually taking up the topic of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
[30.1s] So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
[45.4s] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened.
[52.1s] And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity.
[57.8s] And here we are.

[60.1s] So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we’re not trying to be formal here—trying to make it conversational.
[66.9s] This is a first, um, of a, you know, Kieren-produced podcast of sorts.
[73.1s] I've been on a bunch of them.
[74.6s] I don't think I've ever led one.
[76.0s] So we're going to find out how it goes.

[79.4s] Alrighty, so let's start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?
[88.9s] I'll give my answer to start.

[91.4s] And there's still a kicking-myself aspect to it.
[95.7s] So I became aware—I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011.
[100.8s] So this would have been my senior year in undergrad.
[105.6s] I distinctly remember Bitcoin being $3, down from a recent peak of $14 or $15.
[112.3s] I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit.
[117.8s] I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time.
[121.1s] I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.

[127.4s] If you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal-type provider—that sort of thing.
[137.0s] I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

[144.1s] That said, let me hand the question over to Jim.
[148.4s] When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

Jim:
[150.6s] Aware is different than interested.
[153.0s] In fact, I don't know.
[154.8s] I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it, but I was a little bit too above all that.
[162.9s] Like, oh, that’s a money thing.
[164.5s] I'm not interested in that money world.

[166.9s] So really, no—the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is an old friend of mine, and that Kieren had been following his blog.
[178.3s] And Steve called me up and he's like, "This guy Kieren just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing."

[185.8s] And so at first I was like, "Yeah, I'm not interested in all this fake money thing."
[193.2s] And I went and I read the whitepaper.
[195.2s] And by the end of the whitepaper, I was hooked in.
[198.7s] I was like, this isn’t just about banking or something.
[202.4s] This is about incentivization on the internet.
[204.9s] And that drew me in.

[206.9s] And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed,
[212.9s] I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked.
[215.0s] So that’s when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers—and at the time it was a testnet.
[224.7s] And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled in.

[229.7s] So, well, I don't know—let me pass it on to Victor.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[232.9s] Yeah, Jim—we’ll pick that up.
[234.9s] I’m trying to a little bit stay chronological.
[237.6s] So, you know, 2010–2011 sounds like the same timeframe for you.
[241.6s] I think we’ll pull back in a question or two to that era and we’ll talk in more detail.
[250.4s] But let’s hold on it for just a moment.
[253.0s] Vic, do you want to take it?

Victor Wong:
[254.3s] Yeah, I think I became aware of it around the same time as you.
[258.9s] I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time,
[263.1s] and I felt really disconnected from North America.

[267.3s] So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts.
[271.4s] And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was like all technical podcasts.
[277.2s] And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast "Security Now," which
[281.5s] went really deep into these kind of security technical kinds of things.
[285.8s] And he did like a couple episodes on Bitcoin.
[289.1s] And I was like, really, really fascinated by it—but mostly from a technical angle.

[291.7s] Even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it.
[295.8s] Didn't get any Bitcoin—or if I did,
[302.3s] I didn’t notice it.
[304.9s] I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.

[308.0s] But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there’d be groups of computers in part of their office.
[319.4s] And I was like, "What are those for?"
[320.6s] And they’re like, "Oh, we’re mining Bitcoin."
[322.5s] And I was like, "Why are you mining Bitcoin?"
[325.8s] And they’re like, "Well, we can
[327.9s] make money and it’s basically free internet magic money."
[331.6s] And I was like—I honestly was repelled by that. Like, that kind of seemed too nutty even for me at the time.

Jim:
[341.0s] Did we all hate it before we liked it?

Kieren James-Lubin:
[343.7s] I never hated it.
[344.9s] I was sort of just like, not that interested, I guess.

[350.1s] You know, I think, you know, from the East Coast, the attitude toward stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable.
[360.9s] I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like...
[364.4s] Yeah, you know, after your physics days.

Jim:
[367.7s] You’re not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like—I guess I didn’t hate it.
[371.9s] I just felt I was too good for it.

Victor Wong:
[374.2s] But I think I found the—
[381.3s] Like, everyone talked about, so I was fascinated by the technical aspect, like I said, you know, and it got me to read the whitepaper and even download the software.
[391.7s] But I think the part that kind of turned me off was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask—who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs—they were kind of fanatical.
[404.9s] There was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[411.6s] Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing—mostly ignored
[427.4s] crypto.
[428.9s] Some of them weighed in on it.
[431.1s] But yeah, I think it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful, in some sense, people at that time.

[441.0s] Whereas, you know, you’re fighting for jobs in math or physics or something;
[448.1s] it’s just like,
[449.1s] the most horsepower wins—from an intellectual perspective, and I guess the hardest-working horsepower.
[455.4s] Very few of those people got interested in crypto or blockchain.
[463.0s] A few cryptographers certainly did, and actually probably more established ones compared to younger ones—like folks like Dan Boneh, etc.

[472.7s] But yeah,
[475.0s] I don't know that I was too good for it, but that—
[476.9s] One, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn’t see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

Victor Wong:
[489.5s] Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days as
[493.3s] sketchy, because most of the use cases that—like, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about the use case—you know, I’m a product guy, so I would always ask, "Why would you use it?"
[504.7s] And people would describe things to circumvent existing laws.
[510.9s] Like the big one in China that I remember was like, "Oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules and stuff."
[517.4s] And I was like, "Is that legal?"
[519.7s] And no one would, you know...
[521.8s] mention anything afterwards, basically.

Jim:
[528.0s] I got over feeling too good for it, I’ll tell you that.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[531.8s] Yeah, we all did.

[535.5s] I want to touch on the big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era—and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple of times—was Mt.
[549.2s] Gox.
[549.8s] So Mt. Gox was that first big price run-up.
[554.0s] I believe Bitcoin went from like $30 to $1,200 in a pretty short timeframe.

[562.0s] And as we've seen in the last couple crypto—you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person—
[571.1s] somebody said consumer interest tracks with the price, and people get excited about price momentum, articles get circulated, all that sort of thing.
[581.3s] More people come in and it goes all the way up.
[583.4s] And then, seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top.

[591.8s] Whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values, or some mix thereof, everyone’s hurt on the other side.
[601.6s] And crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this—the protocols themselves seem to be quite sound.

[609.0s] But I guess the question is: do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly?
[614.7s] I feel like lots of people I knew who were not
[619.0s] quite crypto savvy or in the industry, etc., were suddenly paying attention when Mt.
[624.3s] Gox was happening.

Jim:
[626.2s] Just getting into things.
[628.7s] What year was it?
[629.3s] Was it 2015? 2014?
[630.0s] 2014 probably, right?

Kieren James-Lubin:
[632.3s] I think Gox was 2013.
[633.5s] Let me check.

Jim:
[634.9s] Yeah.
[635.0s] Okay.
[635.2s] 2013?

Kieren James-Lubin:
[635.4s] Yeah.

Jim:
[637.0s] Okay.
[637.3s] So that was a little before—but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.
[643.5s] I was new enough to it that it was still—I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me.

[661.5s] But yeah, I think I spent a little time trying to understand—because you know the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible.
[665.1s] They didn't explain what was going on.
[668.7s] So I spent a little time to understand that yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[672.0s] I think you’re right.
[672.9s] So the run-up was actually end of 2013 into the beginning of 2014, it looks like.
[678.9s] Okay, so it officially shuttered February 2014.
[681.8s] And the big $1,200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like.

Victor Wong:
[690.1s] When did the hack happen?
[691.3s] December?
[692.3s] Oh, I think right here.
[693.9s] Okay.
[694.9s] Yeah.
[695.0s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_03:
[697.5s] So, yeah, interesting times for sure.

Victor Wong:
[700.7s] Because I think about Mt.
[702.2s] Gox and—oh, what was... I’m blanking right now. What was the name of that dark web marketplace that used...

SPEAKER_03:
[709.7s] Silk Road.

Victor Wong:
[710.7s] Silk Road.
[711.3s] Yeah, I think
[713.6s] those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right?
[718.1s] I remember even going onto Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there—lots of illicit stuff was listed.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[732.0s] That’s—wow.
[733.7s] You know, I think I never did that.
[735.0s] I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road.
[738.5s] Just heard about it at length.
[739.7s] I had a Mt. Gox account.
[742.1s] And some others.
[742.9s] There was a period where Dwolla was doing crypto stuff.
[747.8s] I think they stopped.
[749.8s] I believe they're still around as like a payment API company.
[754.2s] But yeah, I used them and some others.

Victor Wong:
[758.2s] I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt.
[760.5s] Gox hacks came relatively within the same timeframe of each other.
[765.6s] That was like the first iteration of: "Oh, all crypto and blockchain is dead now."
[776.4s] And yet it just keeps coming back, right?

Jim:
[779.4s] Yeah, it sure does.

[782.7s] There’s a little bit of bias in the news—how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world.
[791.5s] Like, if there’s fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means the blockchain is a corrupt place.
[797.8s] But if there’s fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that just means that we maybe need a little more regulation—or that was a bad person.
[805.6s] So it’s always like, much more tied into the space.
[814.3s] But you don't see, like, E*Trade crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere.
[819.6s] I mean, I guess if the fraud's big enough—but yeah, agreed.

Kieren James-Lubin:
[825.5s] Just a segue quickly.
[828.4s] Yeah.
[829.6s] So going quickly—can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all—yeah, Jim do you want to start or should I?

Jim:
[840.1s] Uh, I'll start and I’ll pass it over.
[843.6s] I—actually back in the '90s, I was in academia, and in the 2000s I was in the startup world. I’d done a couple of startups and was ending one.

[855.8s] I had two sons who were in our local school in California—it was a Mandarin immersion school.
[865.3s] And at this time, there was just a coincidence that both my wife and I had ended jobs.
[873.8s] And we said, "Hey, it’s just been crazy right now.
[876.0s] Let’s take this to its extension.
[879.0s] Let’s go to China
[881.9s] and actually put them in a school there."

[884.2s] So I called around to some various friends.
[886.7s] And one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor’s in Beijing.
[893.5s] And he says, "I’m going to get you in touch with these guys."
[895.8s] So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can explain.

Victor Wong:
[898.3s] Well, yeah—

SPEAKER_00:
[899.1s] And so the VC, you know, who we're still friends with — like he kind of came up to me and he explicitly said, like, "Oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says he wants to come to China."
[911.1s] I'm not sure how serious he is.
[913.3s] So don't put all your eggs in this basket.
[916.1s] But then we started —
[917.8s] talking that summer, and you weren't like traveling in the country, so you were like in a different place.

SPEAKER_01:
[924.8s] Another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

SPEAKER_00:
[931.8s] And I remember like —
[933.6s] you know, like we were kind of talking over the summer and I was like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming.
[940.1s] And at one point you said, "OK, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job in Beijing."
[949.6s] And I went to the school that my kids went to and said, "Can you make space for two foreign kids — this international program?"
[962.8s] They said, "Yes, if you can —"
[965.5s] but the kids have to be here the first day of school.
[968.0s] And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.
[970.9s] So I called Jim up and said, "Look, I can do it."
[973.7s] "I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day."
[978.4s] And to my shock, he actually said yes.
[981.0s] And he like packed up his house and like —

SPEAKER_01:
[983.5s] We packed everything in the house in like — I think we had 12 days to be in school, and we probably had to have the house packed within, like, I don't know, less than a week.
[995.3s] So that was a crazy week.
[997.2s] But Victor was a great help.
[1002.4s] We were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about.
[1005.6s] Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier —
[1008.6s] and so he had sort of scoped out everything.
[1010.1s] He knew where the good schools were.
[1012.3s] He knew where the good apartment buildings were.
[1014.3s] Helped us out tremendously.
[1016.1s] So it was a great experience.

SPEAKER_00:
[1018.3s] It was an exciting time to be in China.
[1019.6s] It was right around the first Olympics —
[1021.6s] like it was right around the Beijing Olympics.
[1024.3s] And so it was a really exciting time.
[1026.0s] But yeah, you wound up staying for about 18 months, right, in total?

SPEAKER_01:
[1030.3s] A little less, but yeah, it was over a year.

SPEAKER_00:
[1033.2s] Yeah.
[1033.5s] And then we just kept in touch from there.
[1035.6s] Like we loved working together.

SPEAKER_04:
[1037.8s] Yeah, it was great.
[1038.2s] What year did you arrive?
[1041.2s] What was this rough time period?
[1042.7s] Yeah.
[1043.2s] Who are you asking?
[1043.9s] Because it was different for you, Jim.

SPEAKER_01:
[1046.2s] Oh — 2011, summer.
[1049.1s] We're driving all over the country — 2011, September, August.
[1053.3s] I can't remember.
[1053.8s] We were in Beijing.

SPEAKER_04:
[1056.5s] Gotcha.
[1057.4s] Gotcha.
[1057.9s] Very cool.
[1059.1s] And so then you’re back — end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that?

SPEAKER_01:
[1066.9s] Yeah, we were back — um, when did we come back?
[1069.8s] I guess we were back in the country in 2013, but like January.

SPEAKER_04:
[1076.1s] Let me segue — I’ll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent.
[1084.4s] So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015.
[1093.2s] I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident — maybe not purely by accident — but basically,
[1106.5s] I had passed my qualifying exam — I’m going to say spring 2014, or maybe April or May 2014.
[1115.2s] So for those who are not aware of how a PhD program works, qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.
[1127.5s] So sometimes there’s a coursework requirement.
[1129.3s] Sometimes you need to translate an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency.
[1137.0s] I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point.
[1141.1s] And so it’s a whole bunch of study, a tense prep. At Berkeley,
[1144.9s] it’s a three-hour oral exam with a couple of people from your department and one from an external department.
[1151.6s] And then they give you a pass or not.
[1153.2s] I got a pass, thankfully.
[1155.7s] I don’t know — everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good, right?
[1161.2s] Like, and, you know. So while I passed it, it was like — you know, didn’t feel great, at least the rest of that day.

SPEAKER_00:
[1169.8s] When did you find out the result?

SPEAKER_04:
[1173.8s] Immediately.

SPEAKER_00:
[1174.8s] Oh, you do?
[1175.4s] Okay.

SPEAKER_04:
[1175.6s] They put you in the hall and they tell you.

SPEAKER_00:
[1177.6s] Okay, that’s good.

SPEAKER_04:
[1178.6s] So you’re just like very nervous.

SPEAKER_01:
[1180.8s] I don’t know what it was like for you, but for me it was just like three guys I knew.
[1184.3s] And I was nervous too, but it wasn’t like they had to go and like, you know, calculate numbers or something.
[1190.4s] They just kind of come out and they’re like, "Yeah."

SPEAKER_04:
[1193.6s] Yeah, exactly.
[1194.1s] It was like that, right?
[1195.0s] Yeah.
[1195.3s] It’s an oral — it’s
[1198.0s] subjective in a sense, but, you know, you’ve got several of the world’s foremost experts in some subject, so they’re able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.
[1215.1s] The qualifying exam led to — you know, I needed like a short break from math.
[1220.7s] I was in mathematical physics.
[1222.5s] And I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking — I can’t quite remember — something having to do with like Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks.
[1240.4s] I can’t remember at this time.
[1243.6s] But it seemed like an OK thing.
[1245.3s] I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer.
[1247.5s] I’m from New York.
[1248.5s] And as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture.
[1254.6s] And I didn’t fully do it.
[1256.1s] I still — I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area.
[1261.4s] But I still kind of like it there.

SPEAKER_00:
[1263.7s] But anyway, that’s it.

SPEAKER_04:
[1265.7s] Yes, Jim’s there.
[1267.2s] I’m in the state of New York at the moment.
[1272.7s] But yeah, I needed a little break basically.
[1275.9s] And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project.

[1280.8s] So somehow my — and I guess I’ll go into this somehow —
[1286.7s] my dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project basically because he was always — he was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time.
[1298.2s] He had a
[1299.8s] CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years.
[1304.3s] And so he was just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services.
[1311.9s] And I guess always had a little bit of the — you know, blockchain philosophical character — let’s say pro-freedom, a little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing.

[1330.5s] And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families.
[1334.3s] He’s from Toronto — a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another.
[1340.8s] And he went, I believe, to — it might’ve been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might’ve been the first Ethereum meetup.
[1349.1s] But this would have been January–February 2014, I believe — and Vitalik was speaking there. And, you know — like everyone around that time —
[1364.0s] you see Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited, right?
[1369.0s] And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away.
[1373.6s] He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project.
[1378.0s] And it didn’t turn out that way.
[1380.7s] We can go into it a little bit later.

[1383.2s] But he started working on it — again, let’s say February–March
[1387.5s] 2014.
[1389.1s] And so he just sent me the white paper — like right after, maybe right before my qualifying exam, I got a chance to read it.
[1396.7s] And it was pretty cool and interesting and new.
[1400.4s] And that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of the technology.
[1404.1s] And it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, et cetera.
[1408.2s] And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer, basically.
[1411.7s] So that’s how I got into it.

[1415.4s] And subsequently — Jim alluded to this earlier — I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, a great friend of ours.
[1430.3s] Kind of — I don’t know — not quite famously brilliant — definitely brilliant, somewhat famous.
[1436.5s] Super cool guy. And I’ve been a long-time reader of Steve’s blog.
[1442.1s] He’s one of the few really excellent —
[1446.6s] kind of general communicators who’s a super technical guy. But most people who are really technical and communicative have a hard time
[1454.9s] distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience.
[1458.4s] But Steve is actually good at that, with nuanced coverage of technical topics.
[1463.5s] So anyway, caught up with Steve, and that takes us to —
[1470.3s] Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.
[1474.3s] And I believe the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area.
[1481.4s] So that takes us to maybe June–July 2014.
[1486.4s] And maybe I came back in August or something like that.
[1491.0s] And it turned out that Jim was there in Hayward, and we got to meet up.

SPEAKER_04 continues… (continued in next message due to token limits)

[1825.1s] And it was good arguments for both, especially when you're talking about, like, a system that custodies—well, not custodies, but, you know—that records a lot of high-value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred.
[1838.5s] Um,
[1840.1s] But all that is to say, it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have someone who was actively in academia to kind of work with and coordinate everything.
[1848.5s] So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group.
[1855.0s] And that was composed of myself, Vitalik, and our friend Aaron Wright.
[1863.6s] He's since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was practicing—
[1870.0s] —attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School. And he came to that Times Square office, which was, you know, not the greatest of offices, I would say, and just sort of really leaned in on
[1884.4s] Ethereum and helped structure everything so that it would be the most robust—not just technologically, but they actually did quite a good job in figuring out how to set things up. Other projects since then certainly did not do as good a job, I'll say.
[1909.0s] So, you know, it was funny times.
[1912.7s] And in 2014, I also got to go to Zug.
[1918.2s] For those who don't know, the Ethereum Foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland.
[1928.3s] And it was kind of—
[1929.6s] it's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations, because I guess the Ethereum Foundation sort of blazed a path.
[1939.0s] And the funny thing about Switzerland is that the local authorities also just seem like business people; like they want to land the future tax revenue and employment.
[1952.1s] And so you can kind of—
[1954.1s] One, Switzerland is split into some number of cantons, which are like states—well, a little smaller than U.S. states, of course.
[1960.8s] And so you can kind of go from canton to canton and try to get the best offer. And "offer" really means tax treatment,
[1972.6s] any kind of grants, or just like helping get fast answers around legal questions.
[1980.9s] You know, one of the tough things about the United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed.
[1985.8s] And in the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear about what they wanted for the special tax treatment, and etc., etc.
[1996.0s] So.
[1998.5s] So we went out and visited Zug
[2002.0s] —I don't know, mid to late summer 2014.
[2005.5s] And I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time.
[2012.3s] I believe there were kind of eight in total.
[2015.1s] And—

Aaron Wright:
[2017.4s] You know, so I think, uh, those numbers changed over time though.

Unknown Speaker:
[2021.1s] Yeah.
[2021.2s] Those numbers change.
[2022.9s] So—well—but, yeah, I think so.
[2026.3s] I don't exactly know how all of it happened, but, you know, Vitalik—it was always a global project, right?
[2031.9s] So Vitalik would go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would want to work with the project.
[2039.8s] And so a bunch of folks got attached to it.
[2045.3s] Um,
[2046.3s] And I think obviously it worked, right?
[2050.5s] But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it.
[2058.4s] Because eight is just too many.
[2060.8s] Like, if you went to a U.S. venture capitalist with a slide that says "eight co-founders," and they're not all currently running billion-dollar companies, you'd be laughed out of the room.
[2073.8s] And yet it worked. It actually functioned.
[2079.7s] And the way it broke apart was that there were the technical guys—
[2089.0s] So I think—I don't quite know how this happened—but pretty early on, Gavin Wood and Jeff Wilcke started building out versions of Ethereum.
[2101.8s] The C++ and Go clients, specifically. We'll go into the clients soon, because there's good stories there.
[2110.8s] Vitalik was building the Python client.
[2113.1s] They were all working together on technical documentation.
[2117.0s] And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that Bitcoin was controlled and centralized, because there's only really one definitive client: bitcoind.
[2129.8s] Right.
[2130.9s] And so there was this huge replication of technical effort—like, each of them eventually got their own teams. There were JavaScript clients—many of them kind of came out later.
[2145.8s] And I'd say the project had sort of tech folks and business folks, like any tech project, but didn't really have a nominal CEO at any time.
[2160.2s] It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson.
[2163.9s] So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like:
[2173.3s] On the business side, Charles as the CEO.
[2177.6s] Amir Chetrit, who is Israeli, kind of did business development.
[2183.4s] He's a funny guy.
[2184.6s] I still see him every once in a while.
[2190.6s] Joe Lubin, my dad, and Anthony Di Iorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience.
[2198.9s] And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff, Gavin, and then Mihai had sort of done corporate setup.
[2209.1s] I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine.
[2213.3s] So Vitalik—
[2215.7s] very interesting character. Most of the time, your technical geniuses are not good communicators.
[2222.0s] And he was a journalist, running Bitcoin Magazine, writing a lot of the articles—he started it, or kind of joined it.
[2232.3s] And, you know, he would—I think he kind of crowdfunded the articles a little bit. Like, “If I can get a pledge of one Bitcoin, I’ll write an article about X.” You know, and at the time, Bitcoin was—
[2247.6s] inexpensive, but those values went up.
[2251.1s] And I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism for all the articles he wrote.
[2256.3s] And it led him to have sort of an impartial thought-leader position, in addition to his really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating, etc.
[2268.1s] And I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them.
[2273.9s] I think Mastercoin was maybe the first colored coin project—he did some work on that.
[2281.3s] So anyway, those were the eight at the time. And there was a meeting for everyone to get on the same page. You know, remote project, there was a Slack.
[2295.5s] People were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting, people stressed, trying to deliver on this awesome concept that Vitalik put out there.
[2305.1s] And everyone kind of tried to grab ownership of—like, was there a reason to have all these different clients?
[2311.1s] You know, in the end, empirically it worked, right?
[2313.4s] But a little bit of it was an “I want Ethereum to be mine” sort of thing.
[2319.4s] And I saw this in the room—
[2324.1s] when we were visiting there.
[2325.8s] So basically, it was quite dramatic, the trip.
[2333.0s] So basically, on this trip, everyone went outside at some point, and people were a little bit sick.
[2341.2s] The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing, to some extent.
[2345.9s] You know, there's always this tension.
[2347.7s] It's probably especially strong early in a company—
[2350.0s] where the tech people are like, "What do I need this business guy for?"
[2354.4s] "We're going to make this thing, and it's going to get out there."
[2357.1s] And the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etc.
[2364.1s] And it's subjective stuff that the tech people don't like—or sometimes understand.
[2373.3s] More or less, this happened. People were uncomfortable with the promises that Charles was making and just the accusations.
[2380.8s] I don’t even really—You know, I know Charles some, but I don’t know what was going on at that time.
[2390.1s] But there was a general sense of frustration with him.
[2392.7s] He also seems to be, in some ways, executing well on a
[2397.3s] smart business strategy, but maybe overpromising what's possible to the point of
[2404.5s] burning people out.
[2406.0s] We kind of saw this later—I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive, I would say.
[2414.4s] But the jury was not out at that time in my eyes, right?
[2418.8s] And Amir also was in the target, because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like.
[2425.8s] So they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug.
[2430.5s] They were out on the terrace—
[2432.8s] they had a nice sort of loft that they rented.
[2435.7s] That was the Ethereum dev house in Zug.
[2439.4s] And so I'm watching this happen.
[2441.1s] And it was kind of—
[2444.3s] —you know, quite crazy.
[2445.9s] And then actually, they instated two more co-founders, so to speak, right then, who jumped on board the project and helped out.
[2455.6s] It was a fun and kind of crazy trip.
[2459.7s] Otherwise, we went out in Zurich. Some people got in trouble with the cops—I won't add more detail to that.
[2466.8s] But Zurich is a funny place where—
[2468.6s] In the U.S., we're not used to people drinking on the street.
[2471.4s] And in Zurich, everyone drinks on the street, and few people are in the bar.
[2476.0s] It was a strange experience.
[2477.0s] We went on some hikes—
[2478.5s] it's a very nice part of the world, Switzerland.
[2482.0s] But plenty of drama in the early days.
[2485.7s] I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about—he had this book about swarm behavior.
[2491.5s] And he learned I had a mathematical background.
[2494.5s] We were talking about the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.
[2498.6s] But yeah, it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized.
[2507.2s] They were also grappling with a decision—initially, they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol and a for-profit—
[2513.9s] They called it "Crypto Google" at the time—
[2517.3s] to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol.
[2519.9s] And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently.
[2525.6s] But that was also decided at that meeting—that they would all be not-for-profit.
[2532.4s] And people didn’t like it.
[2534.9s] Some folks started talking about brain drain.
[2537.6s] It was a mix.
[2538.1s] Some people liked it, some didn't—
[2540.7s] the threat being like, "If you don't do this for-profit, I'm going to leave this project," kind of thing.
[2545.9s] And I think everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses.
[2549.8s] So, you know, it is what it is.
[2552.4s] But anyways, let me pause and see if you—did I tell this whole story to you guys at any point?

Aaron Wright:
[2560.8s] I think you told parts of it, not the entire thing.
[2564.7s] But yes, I didn’t realize this sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period, short period of time.
[2572.7s] You know, that—I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes.

Unknown Speaker:
[2577.0s] I think it was all—like, I think it was going on continually, but it came to a head all in this one meeting.
[2584.0s] Sort of a funny memory—so Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time.
[2588.4s] And we met with a guy named Nicholas, I believe, who maybe was the CEO or one of the founders. I just googled, it says "Founder," and there's a different CEO now.
[2598.5s] But he made this funny—
[2599.6s] He’s a nice guy.
[2600.6s] And I think something happened there—
[2602.5s] I'm not quite sure.
[2604.2s] He made this funny comment.
[2605.4s] We were in an elevator.
[2606.5s] And this shows the difference between the American and Swiss attitude.
[2609.9s] We're in an elevator,
[2610.8s] and it was like one of the ones where it's kind of hand-operated, and you do it yourself.
[2616.7s] And the door could just easily close on you.
[2619.2s] And I was like, "Wow,
[2620.7s] we’d never have this in the U.S. because we're so litigious."

Unknown Speaker:
[2623.2s] And they said, "Well, yeah—Swiss attitude: natural selection."

Unknown Speaker:
[2628.1s] Anyways.

Aaron Wright:
[2629.8s] I don't know.
[2631.0s] Sometimes I think things get grandfathered in. Like, some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too.

Unknown Speaker:
[2636.4s] They are, certainly.
[2637.6s] Yeah.
[2638.1s] It could just be that it's older there, right?
[2641.4s] That makes sense.
[2642.8s] But yeah, so I think the big—other than—
[2646.6s] So Zug, basically what we saw—or let me say—there was growing momentum around the project.
[2653.2s] Lots of people all over the world kind of working on it.
[2657.1s] Stuff was probably not tightly papered—
[2659.3s] you know, no employment agreements probably at that time.
[2662.6s] But there was really intense excitement.
[2666.6s] And I think the belief that everyone was going to be mega successful out of it, like one way or another. You know, it's been kind of interesting to watch.
[2676.5s] Jim, do you want to talk about getting into it?
[2681.2s] And I alluded to all the different clients of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one.
[2689.3s] Do you want to tell your report of—
[2692.0s] that part now?

Jim:
[2693.1s] Well, this part of the story—you know, when you were doing all that stuff, I was—I was too busy driving around the country, but I came back.

Unknown Speaker:
[2699.5s] It comes in a little later, like two, three months later, right?

Jim:
[2703.9s] Yeah.
[2704.5s] Right at the end of the summer, right when you were coming back, I think so.
[2708.5s] And that's when I got really interested in it. I remember the whole culture—
[2713.6s] so I got fascinated with the technology when I read the white paper.
[2716.5s] That's when I realized this was something—something big.
[2719.3s] Um,
[2720.5s] and I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit, but it was a foreign culture to me.
[2725.6s] We—so Natasha, my wife, and I—we decided just to see what this world was like.
[2733.7s] We'd try buying a little Bitcoin.
[2736.4s] And I remember—
[2738.5s] we looked at the various ways to do it.
[2742.8s] And the way we decided on was to meet someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley.

SPEAKER_01:
[2748.5s] And we got there, and he was totally the stereotype—the dude was walking around with, like, the five-toed shoes, and, um...

[2757.2s] It all felt very salacious.

[2761.3s] We walked in with this packet of money in our hands, and we had to, like, meet this guy.

SPEAKER_04:
[2765.2s] And he spent most of the time... do you remember, did he use, like, LocalBitcoins? That was popular.

[2771.3s] I don't know if it's still in existence.

[2773.4s] LocalBitcoins, okay, gotcha.

SPEAKER_03:
[2775.4s] Sorry, go ahead, Jim.

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2776.9s] Yeah, he spent most of the time there railing against the government, how much he hated the U.S. government and all the things they—you know, all the terrible things they were doing.

[2786.4s] And we kind of transferred the envelope over to him, and then we pulled up a computer or our phones or something, and we were, like, watching for six blocks to come by. And finally, it went through, and we were finally Bitcoin owners, so...

SPEAKER_02:
[2801.9s] Wait, did you hang out with him for an hour?

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2806.1s] Or did he leave?

[2807.1s] Because I think we did wait for the six blocks.

[2808.6s] I was going to say...

[2810.6s] Maybe after three, he said to us, like, "You're welcome to stay here if you want."

[2813.9s] But I think after three, it probably wouldn't revert or something.

[2817.1s] So maybe... oh, I remember what it was.

[2819.2s] We went out and sat in the car for another 30 minutes, just in case we had to run back in again.

SPEAKER_04:
[2826.2s] That's really funny.

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2827.8s] Yeah.

[2829.3s] Oh, man.

[2830.0s] Yeah, so that was our introduction into Bitcoin.

[2834.1s] And then, Ron, this time you and I started hanging out a lot.

[2837.3s] We were meeting regularly, and I had started working on the Haskell client, and I brought you in on that, and we'd have these coding sessions at your place.

SPEAKER_03 (Ron):
[2849.4s] Um, yeah, man.

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2851.1s] Okay.

SPEAKER_04:
[2851.3s] So we've gone to—so that's fall 2014.

[2855.9s] Right.

[2856.7s] When we started coding, or even like... yeah.

[2861.2s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2863.4s] I was sort of laughing when you were talking about the overpromising.

[2866.6s] I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember trying to understand what it was at the beginning.

[2874.4s] And some of the material out there was great, but some of it was just very vague and overbroad.

[2880.7s] I would go to these YouTube videos, and people would be like, "Ethereum is a new way of life."

[2885.0s] "It's going to take over as a second internet."

[2887.6s] "We are going to rebuild the internet from beginning to end."

[2890.2s] And I was like, "What are they talking about?"

[2892.5s] And so the only way I was going to really understand this stuff, I thought, was to literally just start writing code.

[2899.2s] And so, you can't hide what's happening.

[2902.0s] So I talked about the whitepaper, but Gavin Wood had put out a yellow paper at the same time, which talked about the technical details of the innards.

[2911.3s] And so I started looking through that and implementing it in my favorite language, Haskell,

[2918.9s] bit by bit, putting the whole EVM in Haskell code.

[2923.3s] So that's what most of the end of the year was like, until—I think in December—I was, so I'm from the East Coast myself, and we flew...

[2937.1s] Sorry, we flew out to New York and I met—you introduced me—you were there at the time too—you introduced me to Joe Lubin.

[2946.1s] And actually, I think before that too, you had set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and Joe directly too.

[2953.0s] So, and just more and more, with the fact that we had a working client, that we were following very closely all the changes in the testnet era before things were solidified,

[2969.1s] we just got pulled more and more into that world.

[2973.3s] And I think one of the big things—sorry,

SPEAKER_04:
[2977.8s] Because we've been sort of assuming an expert audience—can you define the term "client" for everybody?

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[2984.7s] Oh—so it's the software that the blockchain runs on.

[2989.0s] The thing about usual software is that if I just run a video game or something, I just get a computer and I put the software on it, and that's my running project.

[3000.6s] In a blockchain, it's a distributed thing.

[3003.4s] So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on multiple computers simultaneously.

[3010.1s] So you're building sort of a world computer of chained...

[3013.4s] nodes, they call them.

[3015.1s] And so we were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing testnet at the time.

SPEAKER_04:
[3022.8s] Yeah, gotcha.

[3023.4s] Perfect.

[3026.1s] Putting us in the client arms race, if you will.

[3029.5s] That was the one I was trying to make.

[3032.1s] I want to talk real quickly about some other things from that summer.

[3037.6s] You guys participated in the crowdsale, did you not?

[3040.9s] That's why you bought the Bitcoin the first time?

[3042.9s] Or did you buy it sort of first?

[3044.7s] Yeah.

[3045.7s] Yeah, token amount.

[3046.8s] Yeah.

[3047.1s] Gotcha.

[3048.1s] So from our side, we ended up—mostly my dad, but obviously with help from the Ethereum people—

[3056.2s] so they coded up a site to do the crowdsale.

[3060.2s] So Ethereum was one of the first—maybe the first—to pioneer basically a...

[3073.2s] kind of pre-funding event, if you will, where they sold the token Ether in exchange for Bitcoin to the users.

SPEAKER_00:
[3081.6s] Basically an ICO, right?

SPEAKER_04:
[3083.9s] It was essentially an ICO.

[3085.9s] There was no name for it then.

[3089.1s] But I remember it, the price varied a little over the course of the sale, but it was like one Bitcoin to 2,000 Ether, which meant you made pretty good returns if you participated in the crowdsale and sold at the right time—or if you're still holding.

[3108.3s] But the way it worked—it was complicated.

[3112.0s] So Ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy.

[3116.5s] But for Bitcoin, it was basically—I think the Ethereum Foundation had to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to, so that they could mint the Ether in the Genesis block for you.

[3137.2s] But the Foundation, rightly in decentralization terms, didn't want to just hold everybody's keys, right?

[3145.3s] So you had to sort of generate your own keys—and the website did this—and download them.

[3150.3s] And there were these huge warnings, like, "You must download this file."

[3154.5s] "If you lose this file, you will lose access to your funds."

[3158.8s] And so some of the Ethereum folks coded it up, and...

[3164.6s] There was some—I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for traceability's sake.

[3170.6s] I'm not quite sure if they did that.

[3172.1s] Maybe there was just one...

[3174.1s] an Exodus address or that sort of thing.

[3175.9s] But actually, no—there must have been just one.

[3178.6s] So we were a little bit the help desk.

[3182.0s] Sometimes people would try to fund, and it wouldn't work—it was hard for them to try to purchase Ether.

[3186.8s] And there were interesting goings-on.

[3191.0s] There was a fake Twitter account that emerged with the "E" and the "U" in Ethereum transposed.

[3198.5s] So it looked just like "Ethereum," and they had assembled...

[3202.4s] you know, 25,000 followers or something—no doubt bots that some hacker controlled, or maybe you pay for those.

[3211.1s] And they were offering special deals on Ether.

[3215.9s] And so it went live.

[3217.3s] This is something that's been going on for 10 years now.

[3221.0s] Even I've heard—new crypto projects, when they start to get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now.

[3229.9s] So they've gotten more sophisticated.

[3232.8s] But yeah, I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping escalate the ticket, because there could be big theft—and I believe there was not.

[3245.9s] Jonathan configured one of the block explorers—maybe it was Blockchain.info, I can't remember—

[3253.6s] so that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play.

[3258.6s] So we were in this room all day, because we were in help desk mode,

[3265.5s] and we just hear the things come in. There was a schedule—over 14 days, you could fund,

[3271.9s] at no monetary consequence. And then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a 42-day sale.

[3281.5s] All in all, I think 7,000 unique purchasers—something like that.

[3287.7s] But it was quite an affair.

[3290.1s] It's definitely more streamlined now.

[3294.7s] And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion that they were selling software, in essence, to people,

[3304.2s] from a reputable law firm, and all that made it to the terms and conditions.

[3310.9s] It was a big rush to get it all done.

[3313.3s] And then—I think that raised, do any of you remember? It was like $22 million at the time?

SPEAKER_00:
[3319.2s] Yeah, I thought it was—well, it was in Bitcoin, so I think it was like $20 million.

[3323.2s] Well, I remember vaguely that it was...

[3328.5s] At the time of the sale, it was $22 million.

[3331.8s] Yeah, I think it was the biggest crowdfunding...

SPEAKER_04:
[3333.8s] Yeah, I believe that's right.

[3335.5s] It was either one or two ever, at that time—since surpassed by tons, many of which were done in a day.

SPEAKER_00:
[3343.8s] Yeah, exactly.

[3345.3s] But yeah, I think at the time it was around or over $20 million.

SPEAKER_04:
[3350.6s] Yeah, that's right.

[3351.9s] And interestingly, in the course of the sale—and maybe a little bit because of the sale—the price of Bitcoin started to go down.

[3360.8s] So I believe it was $600 or so at the start of the sale.

[3365.2s] And we noticed it dropping...

[3370.1s] kind of continually. Maybe at the end, it's like high $400s, low $500s. And, you know, it's foreshadowing—it'll kind of go on to drop from there.

[3383.5s] But yeah, okay. So do you guys remember the experience of the funding site and all that sort of thing?

[3391.2s] I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[3398.6s] I remember the site. I remember a clock on it, but I don’t remember too much else about it.

SPEAKER_04:
[3403.5s] Yeah.

[3404.6s] Okay, so the crowdsale’s not a huge part of your memory.

[3407.7s] It's a huge part of mine, I guess, because we were dealing with all the issues.

[3411.6s] But Vic, you were just getting kind of interested at this time, right?

SPEAKER_00 (Vic):
[3418.2s] Yeah, exactly.

[3419.6s] Well, Jim—Jim basically, when he was going to buy this Bitcoin, he was like, "Oh, I’m going to buy this Bitcoin to participate in the crowdsale.

[3431.7s] Do you want to participate?"

[3433.0s] And I was like...

[3434.8s] You know, I'm going to feel like a real idiot if I don't do anything.

[3438.9s] So I just—it was just some...

[3444.4s] Yeah, we were just going to say like some nominal amount that we did.

[3448.7s] And of course, it's probably turned into the best investment I ever made.

[3454.6s] But yeah, we had pooled our resources together, because it was so hard.

SPEAKER_04:
[3454.6s] It wasn't easy, right?

[3455.9s] You're generating these 12-word seed phrases, this, that, and the other...

SPEAKER_00 (Vic):
[3461.6s] It was just mind-bogglingly complicated.

[3465.4s] But I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual Bitcoin.

[3471.3s] I mean, Jim was in the Bay Area—the heart of IT and all tech things.

[3476.7s] I was in Vancouver.

[3477.7s] And Vancouver was an early Bitcoin adopter, but it was still really, really hard...

[3484.2s] to find anyone who would be willing to sell you Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_04:
[3490.0s] Yeah, yeah.

[3492.3s] That's very interesting.

[3495.4s] Yes, in any case...

[3501.3s] So, the sale happens.

[3504.3s] And now the project is funded.

[3508.7s] And it's really funded, you know.

[3522.0s] Series A investments were still between like $3 and $10 million back then.

[3528.0s] Salaries probably a little lower than they are now, back then.

[3532.4s] This was a lot of money.

[3534.0s] And so the Ethereum folks then kind of...

[3538.0s] It was very technically driven.

[3539.7s] They kicked in all of their technical dreams, so to speak.

[3545.3s] So Jim's point about the really big claims—they really were, in a sense, trying to create a whole new internet.

[3555.0s] A couple examples.

[3555.8s] So not just the proliferation of...

[3558.6s] clients, right?

[3560.1s] They were going to make a browser—the Mist browser.

[3562.7s] They were going to make a peer-to-peer messaging system called Whisper.

[3568.3s] They were going to make a decentralized file storage system.

[3571.4s] They chose to make a virtual machine, like Java.

[3578.2s] And we always thought that JavaScript was the better analogy, because it kind of won on the internet.

[3584.1s] Has anyone ever seen an applet in the last 15–20 years?

[3588.3s] But they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM.

[3593.4s] And, you know, there's some benefits to that.

[3595.4s] It’s definitely evolved over time.

[3598.0s] I don't know—do you have a more specific memory of—they were making a lot of stuff.

[3604.8s] Can you get into the experience of trying to make something compatible with what they were doing at that time?

SPEAKER_01 (Jim):
[3613.0s] Well, once I found the yellow paper, it wasn't as difficult, because that centered me around the blockchain part of it.

[3618.5s] But it was that earlier marketing material that was very confusing to me.

[3628.1s] You would have these videos like "What is Ethereum?" and then it would just go off into all these things—like you mentioned, a browser, a messaging system.

[3633.9s] And I think there was even some talk in there about replacing TCP/IP or something.

[3638.3s] I can't remember—some of these things actually came into being, some of these didn't.

SPEAKER_02:
[3644.2s] And so I think my learning process was like first realizing what blockchain was, but then like digging a little deeper and being confused that I didn't really know what was happening—because I thought this was going to be a blockchain project, and then they were talking about writing browsers.
[3661.8s] And then realizing when I saw the Yellow Paper that, yeah, this is the core of what Ethereum is.
[3667.3s] That other stuff is sort of like pipe-dream stuff that may or may not come to being.
[3671.8s] But yeah.
[3674.0s] So that's how it went.
[3674.8s] And then once I got the concrete testnet work, then I understood what was going on.
[3685.3s] Gotcha.

SPEAKER_03:
[3686.7s] Yeah.
[3688.0s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_02:
[3689.3s] It was wild.

SPEAKER_04:
[3692.9s] And I'm struggling to remember the timing on all of this.
[3696.5s] Actually, no, I'll go to CryptoEconomicon first.
[3703.4s] So now we're going into January or so, 2015.
[3710.7s] So a couple times, Vitalik visits the Bay Area a bunch.
[3716.6s] Did you remember, we went to a couple meetups with Vitalik, did we not?

SPEAKER_01:
[3720.4s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_04:
[3721.7s] I think it was super casual.

SPEAKER_01:
[3723.6s] I remember it's—it's funny, because you're like, now he's famous, but in those days we would just sort of hang out with him after the meetings. And he would kind of like go and bum a, you know, like a couch to sleep on in the night.
[3737.2s] One time we like drove him to somebody that he found a couch to sleep on. Just fun, casual times.

SPEAKER_04:
[3744.1s] Yeah.
[3744.5s] Yeah.
[3744.7s] I think he—so he won the Thiel Fellowship.
[3747.2s] So there were like beds there.
[3748.9s] And I have a memory of—
[3751.1s] I think we drove, there was a meetup in like the South Bay and like you drove him into the city or something like that.
[3757.2s] There was a Crypto Castle in SF at that time that we occasionally visited.
[3763.7s] Vitalik could hang out there.
[3765.1s] You know, I imagine he still, you know,
[3772.3s] really has little need for creature comforts.
[3774.9s] I'm sure he could procure whatever he likes.
[3777.2s] But, you know, it was—it was funny times for sure.

SPEAKER_00:
[3781.0s] Really nice couches nowadays.
[3783.2s] Really nice couches.

SPEAKER_04:
[3786.1s] Yeah.
[3788.7s] But so I can't even remember quite how we got the idea, but we were talking about—
[3796.5s] For whatever reason, a bunch of people were going to be in the Bay Area late January 2015.
[3802.2s] And I had also, through Steve, through Ben Lorica—who was a great guy, who was at the time sort of the—I think it was the Head of Data Science, but also really the kind of head of content for O'Reilly's conferences and that sort of thing—
[3822.2s] We booked a conference at Fort Mason, and I had a co-host named Lorne Lance, also running a crypto startup these days, I believe—also a great guy.
[3839.3s] So, given that the conference was on the calendar, and we knew a bunch of people in part for the conference, but I think something else was going on to be in the area at that time,
[3848.4s] We decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference that week, which we named
[3856.1s] the verbose CryptoEconomicon.
[3859.9s] I think the term “crypto-economics” either was invented or popularized by Vitalik.
[3864.9s] There's also this guy named Vlad Zamfir—I don't know quite how to pronounce his last name—who was working a lot with Vitalik on
[3875.0s] proof-of-stake and other things and went on to start his own, I think, fairly successful crypto project, the name of which is currently escaping me.

SPEAKER_00:
[3882.4s] Well, he worked on proof-of-stake for a long time, right?
[3884.8s] Then he did have complete proof-of-stake.

SPEAKER_04:
[3886.8s] Yeah, I think he did it for the Foundation for a while, but then started his own thing some time later.
[3894.7s] Funny guy, but he would say like, “Crypto-economics—is it crypto or is it economics?”
[3900.1s] And it certainly never really stuck.
[3902.1s] But that was the theme of the conference.
[3903.9s] So we had like two academic track days and a business track day, I believe.
[3911.1s] I made a bunch of speakers—
[3913.8s] one of whom spoke at the O'Reilly meeting and then would also speak at CryptoEconomicon.
[3920.7s] The building we did it in was co-hosted with a company called Coinify, which I don't believe exists anymore—a nice guy named Tom Ding.
[3934.2s] But I guess Tom Ding had some good
[3936.8s] connections for capital and access with the Chinese government. Do you remember the details around who owned that building?

SPEAKER_00:
[3947.7s] I think it was some construction conglomerate.
[3951.6s] I remember going, “What does this have to do with construction?”
[3956.7s] You know, it didn’t have anything to do with tech at all.
[3959.3s] Like, it was just—yeah, that's the thing.
[3962.0s] That's the thing I remember most about it.

SPEAKER_01:
[3965.2s] So yes, in this circuit.
[3967.8s] I just want to say, I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference, too.

SPEAKER_00:
[3971.8s] We met each other.
[3973.4s] We had already been having conversations online, I think, because you guys would get together and we'd chat sometimes.
[3980.5s] But we’d never actually met each other in person until that conference.

SPEAKER_04:
[3985.6s] Yeah, it was like a month or two or three in, I think, at that time.

SPEAKER_00:
[3991.4s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_04:
[3992.2s] And it was like a cast of characters. The O'Reilly Conference was a little more shiny, corporate—
[4000.8s] you know, three or four hundred attendees, something like that.
[4003.7s] Pretty successful.
[4005.7s] The
[4007.6s] crypto-economics conference was great, but kind of crazy.
[4011.2s] Like there was a guy—his name is escaping me—he’s a smart guy, in very tight bike shorts,
[4018.2s] and he kept raising his hand.
[4025.1s] I think he had a defense background.
[4029.2s] At the time, IBM had a big speaking slot.
[4038.0s] They were promoting Ethereum plus some other technologies as the key to their IoT stack.
[4041.3s] OK, I actually looked this up.
[4043.0s] So the participants—it was a very small group of people, maybe 20-25—
[4049.4s] but among that group of people was—so yeah, Vlad, who was working on proof-of-stake, was there.
[4057.6s] Vitalik was there.
[4058.6s] Gavin [Wood] was there, who was working on Ethereum but later went on to do Polkadot.
[4063.7s] Dominic [Williams], who went on to do Internet Computer, was there.
[4067.8s] I think Jae Kwon was there, who went off to do Cosmos.
[4074.5s] A bunch of Bitcoin Core devs were there.
[4076.4s] It was just a crazy group of people.
[4084.0s] If you looked at the amount of talent—people talk about the PayPal mafia.
[4088.2s] That was like the crypto mafia, right?
[4090.2s] Almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project.

[4097.7s] I remember being in that room, and we started talking, and I was really just starting my journey about learning about Ethereum.
[4109.3s] And I was just completely baffled.
[4111.0s] I spent probably 90% of my time on Wikipedia trying to figure out, like, “What does the Byzantine Generals Problem have to do with technology?”
[4121.7s] “Why are they talking about this?”
[4124.2s] Or, you know, “SNARKs—what are SNARKs?”
[4127.4s] I remember trying to madly keep up with these things.
[4132.4s] But just being in that room was exciting.
[4135.5s] It was the first time that it totally clicked—that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform.
[4145.2s] And because it always got overshadowed by the financial, money/crypto aspect of it, right?
[4152.7s] But in that room, it was very different.
[4154.8s] Everyone was really focused on: “Okay, how do we build this world computer?”
[4160.5s] And yeah, I mean, the talent level was off the chart in that room.
[4166.3s] It was just amazing.

SPEAKER_02:
[4168.6s] Yeah.
[4170.3s] I think you should tell the Robin Hanson story.

SPEAKER_04:
[4173.7s] For context of the listener, if we get any—Robin Hanson is a really smart guy, kind of famous, sort of a quite technical economist.
[4185.8s] I think he's at George Mason or something like that.

SPEAKER_01:
[4188.8s] Good Twitter follow too.
[4190.1s] You should follow him.

SPEAKER_00:
[4191.5s] Well, he invented prediction markets, basically.

SPEAKER_04:
[4194.6s] Yeah, pretty much.

SPEAKER_00:
[4195.5s] He's the father of prediction markets.
[4196.8s] And to be clear, Robin Hanson is way smarter than I'll ever be.
[4202.3s] But I was in that conference, madly on Wikipedia for the three days ahead of O'Reilly.

SPEAKER_01:
[4210.4s] We ourselves were all pretty new to blockchain.
[4212.8s] So yeah, that’s true.

SPEAKER_00:
[4214.9s] And people were going really, really deep into these conceptual things.
[4221.7s] But after those three days was the O'Reilly Conference.
[4228.0s] And at one point in the O'Reilly Conference, they had like a lunch where everyone sat around these big tables—a kind of networking part of it.
[4237.1s] I remember Robin was one of the panelists on a panel about blockchain.
[4245.1s] He was asking me like, “Oh, what do you do?” and “What are you here for?”
[4249.1s] And we had a conversation.
[4250.6s] I just kind of summarized a few things that I'd learned over the past three days.
[4257.0s] So we had this conversation.
[4258.8s] And I said, “It's not really about money. It's about building this world computer,” and all these things.
[4264.0s] And he basically got on stage and reiterated a bunch of things I had told him during lunch.
[4269.9s] And everyone was like, “How did Robin become a blockchain expert?”
[4273.9s] “He's really on the cutting edge of where this technology is.”
[4279.1s] But it was just amazing, you know.

SPEAKER_03:
[4284.0s] Yes, yeah.
[4286.6s] It was—yeah, it was quite a room of people.

SPEAKER_04:
[4290.0s] We had some other—so Rob was also a bit of a futurist.
[4293.0s] We had another kind of quote “futurist” guy named Steve Omohundro—I don't know how to pronounce it. He was super smart as well.
[4300.3s] I’ve not really spoken to him in a long time.
[4303.1s] But I think there was this energy in the air that was quite palpable.
[4310.7s] And so it kind of—
[4313.0s] I don't know, it was a big thing that convinced us to start our company, I would say.

SPEAKER_00:
[4320.5s] I think the thing that kind of convinced us was that it was like being in two rooms, right?
[4325.8s] There was CryptoEconomicon, where everyone was talking about this new kind of computing platform and all the things it could do.
[4332.5s] And then there was the O'Reilly Conference, where you had a bunch of big bankers—you know, like Reid Hoffman was there—and they were talking about
[4340.7s] money, like this was about money.
[4343.1s] And it was clear that they didn’t know what was really going on in the other room. Like, something much, much bigger was happening.
[4353.9s] And I think that convinced us, like, oh, we could build a bridge between these two worlds.

SPEAKER_04:
[4359.7s] Yeah, yeah, I remember that distinctly.
[4362.5s] And it was such a funny time.
[4364.9s] The big headliners at the O'Reilly Conference were Reid Hoffman,
[4371.1s] Balaji [Srinivasan] spoke.
[4372.7s] Yeah, Bill Janeway, I believe, and, you know, some others.

[... Transcript continues with the next section ...]

[4554.3s] So you have to get it totally perfect and then it makes sense.
[4556.8s] If you don't get it perfect, nothing makes sense and you don't know why.
[4560.0s] I was just irrationally about it.

Jim:
[4563.5s] I didn't care whether this was good or bad for the
[4567.0s] for the product.
[4567.8s] I was like, what?
[4568.7s] But I was actually genuinely confused too, because you have like this open network that anyone can connect to, but you want to encrypt everything that's going on it.
[4577.2s] It took me a while to figure out why that actually happened.
[4579.2s] I was asking around in various like DM services.
[4584.9s] I don't remember where I used to go and talk to people.

Unknown:
[4588.1s] And I found—There were giant Skype threads, I remember.

Karen:
[4592.2s] There was like huge... Like we—this was, I think we weren't even using Slack yet. It was like, there's tons of—Slack was just getting popular at this time. Ethereum had a Slack, ConsenSys had a Slack—we can get to the ConsenSys story a little bit.
[4612.1s] But yeah, we had a Skype thread, for some reason, you know, like just because it was the thing that people used for a threaded discussion group. WhatsApp maybe wasn't popular—not for this purpose, you know, so a couple of months...

Jim:
[4627.9s] I dug around a while to figure out why in the world encryption had even been added to this.
[4632.1s] And I kept getting sort of like, oh, we want to make sure that this information is private.
[4636.7s] And I was like, it doesn't make sense.
[4638.2s] I can connect anywhere and see this stuff.
[4640.8s] Finally found one of the people that had implemented it.
[4643.1s] And the idea wasn't crazy.
[4645.5s] It had nothing to do with—
[4646.9s] I mean, I guess it had something to do with encryption.
[4649.9s] But their thought process was that it was more about identity.
[4653.6s] Once you join, you wanted to have essentially like a cert that verified that you are who you say you are.
[4659.4s] And they wanted that there for the various extensions that they were putting in.
[4664.3s] And so, okay, that wasn't crazy.
[4667.4s] It was very annoying to me to spend a week of my life trying to implement this.

[4672.2s] But the other thing that's kind of funny is that—
[4675.0s] Um, and maybe Karen, you know more from talking to people over the summer—but there was sort of a distrust in standards.
[4684.2s] And so like, I think the thing a usual software engineer would do would be to actually get SSL and implement it with that. Or to take, like,
[4696.2s] hash algorithms that had like a corporate stamp of approval and put that in.
[4704.3s] But they always wanted to sort of put things a little bit outside of there, because I think they feared—maybe truthfully—backdoors in all of these things.
[4711.6s] And so I essentially had to go and get a lot of non-standard encryption algorithms and paste them together into an SSL-like thing.

Karen:
[4726.5s] Yeah, I can add a little bit on that.
[4728.4s] I would say the building blocks were at least semi-standard.
[4733.3s] They used the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin for the actual signatures and to transfer the money and all that.
[4741.5s] The algorithms that went into the reinvention of SSL—I think the building blocks were just normal stuff.
[4750.2s] They didn't invent hashing algorithms or signing algorithms and all that sort of thing.
[4753.9s] But the composition is something you have to be quite careful about.

Jim:
[4757.0s] They weren't just inventing encryption.
[4759.8s] So they were taking things that were approved of, but they weren’t taking things that were the standards.

Karen:
[4766.4s] Exactly.
[4767.0s] That's right.
[4767.5s] And I think it did have to do a little bit with backdoor fear.
[4771.8s] But also, I remember a comment one time like, you know, TCP has never been proven to be able to be the backbone of a peer-to-peer network.
[4781.7s] And there was some like—I think BitTorrent,
[4785.5s] you know, maybe it used UDP or something, plus something proprietary on top or something.
[4790.3s] There was the belief that the existing protocols were insufficient.
[4797.3s] And that might be right.
[4799.2s] It also might be just like, going back to the point—they had a lot of money at this point, like they wanted to rebuild everything.
[4806.9s] So I think it's probably some mix of those things.

Jim:
[4812.1s] I mean, for instance, the hashing algorithm that they chose to use in the early days—they were calling it SHA-3.
[4822.1s] But SHA-3 hadn't been finalized at that point in time.
[4824.9s] So they were sort of like taking the proposal.
[4827.5s] And so I went and got the code in the Haskell codebase that did the proposed SHA-3 at that point in time.
[4840.7s] And then one day I kind of like went into the—I think like the C++ client—and looked around, and they started calling it Keccak.
[4848.7s] And I was like, what? What’s going on here?
[4850.9s] Why did they change the algorithm?
[4852.3s] But it was still connecting to what I had there.
[4854.1s] So, uh, it was a little bit confusing.
[4856.7s] And I found out later what had happened was,
[4860.0s] there had been a last-minute change in SHA-3, and the Ethereum team felt that this was a government backdoor that was being put in there, and they refused to put that change in.
[4871.0s] And so they stuck with the original proposal, which was called Keccak, which is something that I had already implemented there. But they aren't technically SHA-3 anymore.

Karen:
[4884.9s] Joshua.

Jim:
[4886.0s] Yeah.

Karen:
[4886.3s] I have a vague memory.

Jim:
[4887.1s] I'm not saying it was a government backdoor.
[4888.7s] I don't know one way or the other. But that was their belief.

Karen:
[4894.2s] Can you talk a little bit about—okay, you're talking to Roman at this time.
[4901.5s] Who’s Roman?
[4902.6s] You know, what was going on?
[4904.0s] I also remember—
[4905.3s] Um, like the issue of sync, and I want you to say it, but I’ll prompt you if need be.

Jim:
[4913.8s] Um, well, I remember sync speed was… Okay. So that's—yeah.

Unknown:
[4919.3s] Yeah.

Jim:
[4919.8s] You know, there were kind of like two tiers of software developers in the original sort of testnet.
[4930.7s] There were like those who were around from the beginning—I was not in that group, you know, again, driving around the country.
[4938.7s] But—and that included, I guess, Python, which was Vitalik’s; C++, and Geth were first tier.
[4950.3s] Was there another first tier?
[4951.2s] I’m trying to remember.

Karen:
[4953.7s] I think those were the three like Foundation-sponsored ones.

Unknown:
[4960.0s] I think that BRMJ was in the original group, but then it got kind of—
[4965.5s] Pulled out, perhaps.
[4967.0s] Pulled out, yeah.

Karen:
[4968.3s] OK.
[4969.1s] I mean, Roman might have worked for the Foundation for a bit.
[4973.9s] He did.
[4974.3s] Yeah, he might have.

Unknown:
[4975.3s] Yeah, gotcha.

Jim:
[4975.6s] Roman felt a little mysterious to me, because I first thought he was part of the Foundation.
[4979.4s] But then I found out later he had been someone who came in a little bit later.
[4982.8s] And then maybe there was some—I don’t know, again, maybe you know more than I do, Karen—but there was maybe some arguing there or something.
[4990.3s] And so they weren’t really communicating with him as much.
[4993.4s] Don’t know if I got that right. But…
[4995.0s] So yeah, Roman was the Java client.
[5000.6s] What was Roman’s last name?

Karen:
[5002.9s] Mandal—Mandaley?
[5004.9s] I don’t know how to pronounce it.
[5006.0s] M-A-N-D-E-
[5009.3s] E-I-L, something like that.

Unknown:
[5011.7s] We can look at it.
[5012.4s] It was Roman who did Java.
[5015.4s] Gavin was doing C++, and Jeff was doing Go, I think.
[5019.0s] And then Vitalik—Python.

Jim:
[5020.7s] But Roman and I were the later guys, and I did the Haskell client.
[5023.9s] And Roman may or may not have been in the Ethereum Foundation.
[5027.7s] I was not in the Ethereum Foundation, but I met with those guys a number of times.
[5036.9s] The thing that everybody—I guess what you were alluding to, I’m not sure what precisely the story is you're looking for—but it was sync speed that everybody would compete against.
[5047.2s] And I remember going to various meetups and Roman would always kind of run up to me and be like, “How long does it take you to sync up to a million blocks
[5056.1s] in the testnet now?”
[5057.1s] And so there was always this competitiveness around sync speed, which is an important thing. But there are other things too.
[5065.8s] And so everybody was just rushing to get sync speed faster and faster at that point in time.

Karen:
[5071.3s] Yeah, the thing I wanted to capture is like—in some ways, one—at the time it seemed a little juvenile, but it was also genius. Like it got a lot of technical energy all focused around this one thing: Ethereum.
[5091.9s] You know, these people probably could’ve tried to make their own Ethereum-like blockchain or Bitcoin-like blockchain, or all that sort of thing.
[5092.7s] But—
[5103.0s] You know, it was sort of open-source “may the best get merged” sort of attitude, and it probably made for a better product at the end of the day.
[5116.2s] That was kind of the main point. Like, yeah, it felt like nerdy kids playing with things, but it kind of worked, you know.

[5127.2s] I also remember they flooded the testnets with giant blocks of data at some point. You know, people were treating it like this was a spacecraft launch—you had to like really stress test it because it’s going to be the new world computer.
[5139.2s] And so in some ways, while the development was far more incremental than Bitcoin, there was still very stringent and perhaps unrealistic scenario testing that was going on before the launch.

Unknown:
[5154.4s] I think one thing that's kind of interesting about it also is that it was very meritocratic, right? And like there was all this competition going on, but even though like—
[5167.4s] Gavin was technically CTO and Vitalik is obviously Vitalik—but they didn’t win.
[5173.9s] The one that won was Jeff’s Go client.
[5178.7s] You could imagine in any other scenario they could have just put their foot down and said, “No, we’re going to go with Python” or “No, we’re going to go with C++.”
[5186.3s] But they went with the one that actually performed the best and was doing the best.

Jim:
[5191.6s] It was a surprise to me. I was always treating C++ as the reference client.
[5197.2s] And Gavin was sort of more of a spokesman over there at the time. Jeff was sort of quieter.
[5207.7s] At the last minute, I think there was some discussion that they needed to go through a security audit.
[5215.5s] And the story I heard—I don’t know if it’s true or not—is that they chose to do Geth first, thinking that the C++ would be the last thing and they would put that out there.
[5225.4s] But he kind of quietly went through that.
[5228.1s] And honestly—I don't know, maybe I’ll step on toes saying this—but from using all of these clients, Geth was the most stable at the time.
[5237.8s] I would always start it and it would run.
[5239.9s] C++ was changing a lot.
[5241.3s] And so often, I would start it and—oh—it’s not working today.
[5244.7s] I think that, plus the security audit, pushed it over and people used that one a lot.

Karen:
[5251.3s] Yeah, yeah. I have a similar memory.
[5254.8s] And of course Gavin went on later to create Parity—the Rust version—which I think got pretty popular.
[5261.8s] I’m not quite sure where it stands today.

[5269.2s] Talking about security, I want to hone in on the theme of the shifting launch date.
[5275.5s] Jim, do you remember our “Viktor 2”?
[5279.5s] We had started to work on a company related to all of this, and were getting worried because they kept adding more stuff, basically.
[5288.8s] Do you want to—can you—kind of go into anything you remember from that time?

Jim:
[5295.5s] It would have continued except for a bit of unluck that in a way was lucky.
[5306.4s] What ended up happening is Bitcoin crashed at that time.
[5306.4s] And it really put the fire under everybody’s feet that they had to get this thing out immediately,
[5311.2s] because their holdings were in Bitcoin.
[5314.9s] And so I think if that hadn’t happened, there wouldn’t have been the pressure to push it out right then and there.
[5320.0s] And they might have just kept adding and modifying indefinitely after that.

Karen:
[5326.2s] So I believe the foundation was paying people sort of denominated in fiat currency, but with Bitcoin.
[5334.8s] So if it’s X number of thousand euro or USD per month, the Bitcoin amount would vary.
[5342.8s] And yes, to that end—
[5349.4s] I remember in that room at Zug,
[5353.1s] there was discussion like, “Well, what if Bitcoin goes to 10,000?”
[5355.4s] Because that would be really high at that time.
[5356.5s] Like, we shouldn’t convert it.
[5359.5s] And they ended up being right.
[5365.1s] You know, I think the prudent move would have been
[5368.9s] at least some diversification in the treasury.
[5376.1s] I believe they kept it all in Bitcoin and paid it out—I think—in Bitcoin. But again, the amount would vary.
[5381.2s] And of course, some bills just had to be in euro or
[5386.2s] whatever—Swiss francs or USD.
[5390.0s] And so there was no avoiding the fact that runway was shrinking.
[5397.2s] From, you know, having brought in the roughly $22 million, ramping up big dev teams, a lot of redundancy—
[5406.6s] So I think three full dev teams for the clients; maybe half a dev team for Python, because it was kind of just Vitalik working out how it all works.
[5409.9s] It was not going to be as fast as the others because it was in Python.

[5411.3s] Then there was—I think they started paying the JavaScript people later. There was development of the Mist browser. There’s—you know—the libraries and tooling started getting going.
[5422.0s] They were doing a lot.
[5424.3s] And almost all of it was technical.
[5427.9s] Not too much had like a business development focus.
[5432.5s] And yeah, then the price drops and suddenly—what had been forecast as a 2016 launch timeline—got moved up to maybe July 2015.

[5445.5s] And so we're sitting there, you know, in March, like, "Oh, you're telling us the thing is going to launch in 2016?"

[5451.8s] Like, did we be doing this?

[5453.8s] And then it moves up.

[5455.9s] And it was great that it moved up.

[5458.3s] Jim, do you recall, do you remember how you predicted roughly when it would launch?

Jim:

[5465.7s] No, I'm not sure what you're referring to.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5470.1s] I think you plotted a commit graph—like, it was commits by day in the Ethereum repo.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5478.1s] Yes, I remember this.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5480.2s] I don't remember this, but okay, I don't doubt I did it.

[5483.3s] Yeah.

[5483.9s] So, like, the July date came a couple—uh, it was after the deadline had been moved a couple of times.

[5489.6s] So basically, they were running out of money.

[5491.9s] They moved the deadline, the launch date, way up.

[5495.3s] Right.

[5496.5s] And they moved it.

Jim:

[5498.1s] I remember thinking very heavily about how it had been changing very quickly, and then it slowed down, and I was happy.

UNKNOWN:

[5505.1s] Yeah.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5505.4s] And I will say, that 2016 date happened after a series of changing dates.

[5512.4s] Because we were like, "Hey, we want to launch this company," but we were still connected to—hopefully—the live net at the time.

[5521.1s] And so we were trying to time our thing.

[5522.9s] And they were changing dates all the time too.

[5525.6s] And so I think the 2016 date was the last one before they changed their mind and refocused.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5533.1s] There were many eras, which everyone has copied since.

[5537.1s] There was like—what were all the names?

[5540.2s] Serenity after it launched.

[5541.6s] There was Metropolis.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5543.7s] Serenity.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5544.4s] You know, they were like epochs, where there'd be testing of the software.

[5552.0s] And they intended to stay on testnet for quite a long time.

[5554.8s] That’s the upshot.

[5555.7s] And I think they ended up crediting some of the testnet-mined ether, like 10 to 1 against real ether—so 10% of the value—for the people who mined on the testnet.

[5568.2s] So they made it kind of progressively more real, but it really was fortuitous that there was that price crash, because it might have never seen the light of day.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5577.3s] So many of the—I think you didn't even elucidate all of the projects.

[5583.0s] There was a Raspberry Pi client that—

UNKNOWN_02:

[5585.1s] I forgot about the Raspberry Pi!

UNKNOWN_00:

[5587.5s] There were so many projects, like, we were like, "What is going on here?"

UNKNOWN_04:

[5593.1s] You know, like—they built—okay, so there were many different—like, I think I said, there was Serpent, which was the Python-like language that compiled to EVM.

[5606.1s] There’s Solidity, which won.

[5608.2s] So, you know, C++ lost, but Solidity won.

[5612.5s] Yeah, and Solidity was kind of put together by Gavin and sort of looked like a C/JavaScript-style language.

[5622.4s] There was another one.

[5624.6s] LL—

UNKNOWN_00:

[5625.7s] LL was like a Lisp-like language.

[5628.0s] Yeah, it was Lisp-like.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5629.9s] To some extent, it let the developers just be free to do things that developers always want to do—like build peer-to-peer messaging systems, write compilers, you know...

[5638.7s] It was like, put it to work.

UNKNOWN_02:

[5640.3s] Try to do DSL.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5641.0s] Exactly, yeah.

[5643.8s] Yeah, no, that was funny.

[5645.7s] Okay—

[5646.0s] Let's go to—because we can get close to wrapping up here, and you know, if there's interest, we could do another one of these, because there's lots after the launch.

[5656.6s] Let's go to kind of right before the launch.

[5660.0s] Okay.

[5660.3s] So—

[5662.0s] As we're talking about the launch run-up, a bunch of interesting things happened.

[5667.1s] One, we had started—to some extent—working as part of ConsenSys.

[5672.9s] So we kind of joined the company, and they functioned sort of as an incubator—basically—for us and plenty of other firms and concepts, some of which stayed in-house, and some of which also spun out.

Jim:

[5689.7s] Brooklyn was awesome too.

[5690.9s] I had never been to Williamsburg or Bushwick, and it was sort of moving in various locations there.

[5697.2s] So I used to love coming and hanging out at the offices.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5700.7s] Yeah, ConsenSys got the famous office on Bogart, but the first one was by the water in Williamsburg.

[5709.6s] It was like something—

UNKNOWN_00:

[5710.7s] It was in Greenpoint.

[5711.6s] I remember getting completely lost at one point and finding it, like, at Williamsburg.

Jim:

[5718.9s] It’s great.

[5719.4s] I remember sitting there one day, and all of a sudden, everybody came screaming in, and they were filming an episode of Girls outside.

[5726.9s] So I ran outside and watched them film part of an episode—not the whole episode.

UNKNOWN_02:

[5733.1s] Wow.

[5733.6s] Yeah, that was—so, okay, was that early March? April?

UNKNOWN_00:

[5739.1s] Yeah, I think it was April-May kind of thing.

[5743.4s] We moved into the Bogart office just before the launch of Ethereum.

[5749.1s] In fact, one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5758.2s] Right, right. Okay, yeah, I do remember that.

[5762.1s] So, you know, we were frantically building the software, starting to work with people from within ConsenSys.

[5771.7s] We had some folks join the project—some of whom have gone on to big blockchain success.

[5780.7s] Should we tell the Tim story?

UNKNOWN_00:

[5783.1s] Well, yeah. I mean, Tim—the founder of Truffle—helped us build our first blockchain explorer.

[5792.1s] I mean, he was a brilliant developer back then, and still remains a brilliant developer.

[5796.4s] Aaron, I think, helped us—who went on to build MetaMask.

[5803.1s] We had lots of conversations with him about how to create our REST API—and how it would work.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5810.9s] I met up a couple of times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also.

[5815.0s] It was funny—these folks would just come by, and now they're at different levels of being a big deal.

[5821.2s] Yeah, exactly.

[5821.9s] I feel like you should tell the hard-hitting version of the Tim story just a bit, because in retrospect it was funny, right?

UNKNOWN_00:

[5829.0s] Well, I think the thing is, we were really focused—at the time—I think the first idea we had with BlockApps was that we would create a REST API.

[5840.5s] And I come from sort of a lean startup background—we really wanted to push deadlines.

[5850.4s] And at the time, people were more in an exploration mode; they were trying to do different things.

[5855.3s] And I was kind of ratcheting up the pressure to present this at some—

[5861.8s] I don't know if it was a conference or meetup that night.

[5866.2s] And as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that, people were like, "You know, I think I want to pursue my other interests instead of working in this high-pressure environment."

[5879.3s] And a lot of early ConsenSys was like that.

[5883.7s] It was different working styles and different methodologies.

[5887.2s] But in the end, it was kind of amazing, the people who did stuff.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5892.5s] Yeah. I would say lots of really smart people, and a lot of flow between projects.

[5900.2s] It was amorphous at the beginning.

[5903.4s] There was a lot of excitement, but it was also hard to get someone who was “assigned” to your team to do the thing you expected them to do.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5913.8s] Well, that's the thing—there weren’t team assignments, right?

[5917.4s] There weren't teams.

UNKNOWN_02:

[5919.8s] They were suggested, you know.

UNKNOWN_00:

[5922.8s] Exactly.

[5924.5s] But people were just flowing in and out—which is great for creativity, but hard when you're trying to make a deadline.

[5931.1s] Because when you're trying to make a deadline, there's always sort of not-great things to have to do, right?

[5938.8s] Like, you've got to work really long hours and that kind of stuff.

Jim:

[5942.0s] Yeah.

UNKNOWN_04:

[5945.9s] So we looked and saw in our early approach some success at API companies—chain.com was, at the time, touting a big list of customers that used their API.

[5960.7s] They then pivoted to a couple of other things, with more of an enterprise outlook, and then kind of pivoted back—and were eventually bought by Stellar, I believe.

[5974.3s] So there was some precedent for "OK, let’s have an API, let’s make this really easy for people to use."

[5979.8s] And “this” being the Ethereum network itself.

[5982.8s] And I think we found pretty strong resistance to this idea.

Jim:

[5987.9s] Do you want to talk more about this?

UNKNOWN_00:

[5991.4s] So I think while you guys were working on the client, I was trying to build smart contract-based applications, right?

[6003.1s] Like, you described some of the tooling that was missing, and for front-ends, the languages were constantly changing.

[6013.3s] A lot of this seemed to be an afterthought—like, "OK, we'll solve that later in the puzzle."

[6018.5s] But it was impossible to build an application, share it around, just get something running quickly, you know?

[6027.7s] And so we—

[6029.8s] My background was web and mobile startups.

[6032.7s] And the first thing you look for is a REST API.

[6035.6s] And I thought, "OK, if we're ever going to get this ecosystem to really work, we need to have something like that so people can build these applications."

[6048.9s] But yeah, we got a lot of resistance to it, because—

[6052.3s] It was like we were speaking Martian to people.

Jim:

[6056.7s] They had no interest in anything that sounded a little bit corporate-y.

UNKNOWN_00:

[6063.5s] It wasn't even corporate-y. It was more like...

UNKNOWN_04:

[6066.3s] There was a general suspicion of servers.

Jim:

[6070.6s] I remember the phrase, "Yeah, I don't know if I want to work on anything that involves any servers."

[6329.6s] This is funny.
[6331.9s] This is another foreshadowing for a future episode.
[6334.2s] But yes, IBM—they've been circling this whole time.
[6338.2s] And they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the Consensus hackathon.

Alex Van De Sande:
[6344.8s] But like, I remember us furiously—and just the uncertainty of the launch.
[6350.8s] I was like, I remember we had many, many conversations like, is this thing ever going to launch?
[6355.8s] Like, we weren't sure if it would happen.

Unknown Speaker 03:
[6359.4s] Yeah.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6360.6s] Do you remember?
[6361.4s] Okay, let's talk quickly about the mining that we did.
[6367.2s] And this was all for the company, you know, but—
[6373.5s] Do you recall what we did at that time?

Alex Van De Sande:
[6378.1s] Yeah, I totally remember.
[6379.3s] So I remember—well, at some point up to the launch, we realized, okay, if we were going to help businesses or other groups build applications on Ethereum, we would need Ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions.
[6399.4s] We're like, well, where are we going to get this Ether from?
[6401.8s] And, you know, I think the first thing that happened was you guys were like, oh, we need to build a mining rig, right?
[6407.3s] I'll hand that over to you, Jim.

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6409.0s] I think that was... Karen and I drove up to Fry’s and picked up a bunch of components.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6417.8s] We did.
[6418.4s] And, you know, we were kind of ready for it because I believe we had—you had helped me build just like a workstation.

Unknown Speaker 03:
[6425.9s] Like a month or two before.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6428.7s] Basically the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation.
[6435.3s] So it made a big productivity difference.
[6438.5s] We went back and yeah, I think—so I moved closer to campus at that time.
[6446.2s] We took a couple of different shots at mining, but what did—you know, I think—
[6451.9s] Mine exploded, the power supply blew up, the graphics card was actually okay.
[6460.5s] Something happened to yours, I can't remember.

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6462.0s] We got it going eventually, but the part that was funny I remember is that we spent like two or three days building these machines, getting it up, putting the software on, getting it running, hitting some problems—and Ether started to dribble in at that point in time.
[6477.9s] So we're like, oh, this is awesome.
[6479.5s] And then we called up Victor, and he's like, yeah, in the last half hour I just spun up a few machines at Amazon and I'm getting as much Ether as you guys are.

Alex Van De Sande:
[6487.9s] Well, it was more than a few machines.
[6489.7s] So I remember watching you guys build this and thinking, oh, this is going to launch any day now.
[6497.3s] So I said, can someone give me an image—
[6501.9s] of the Go client.
[6504.8s] And I took that image, and I just put it on Amazon, and I had a bunch of spot instances.
[6511.1s] And at some point, I was running—and I just bought as many spot instances as were available.
[6518.1s] Whatever met my price, I bought.
[6520.3s] And this was before mining was even known to be something that happened.
[6524.8s] So I could still get it pretty cheap.
[6527.4s] And the blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast if you were starting.

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6533.5s] None of this is stuff you could do today.
[6535.0s] In fact, none of this is stuff you could do last year.

Alex Van De Sande:
[6537.0s] And it stopped being effective.
[6539.9s] I remember at the point of the launch, you guys were saying, yeah, we got our first Ether.
[6545.6s] And I was like, do you see this graph?
[6548.9s] This is the total mining power of the Ethereum network.
[6552.0s] That large wedge, which was like 25%, is me.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6558.0s] Oh God, we should have cranked it up just like another couple of weeks longer.

Alex Van De Sande:
[6562.9s] I know.
[6564.3s] Well, I think by the time, you know, three days had passed, I'd passed like several thousand dollars.
[6571.1s] Like our AWS bill was like... yeah, it seemed super expensive at the time.
[6574.9s] It seemed super expensive at the time.
[6576.8s] And like, I was like, oh wow, like this is good.
[6579.2s] But yeah, I should have run it for like, you know, a month basically.
[6583.1s] And then it was pretty amazing.
[6586.5s] Because like—
[6586.9s] Yes.
[6587.6s] I'm not a DevOps guy, but I was like running hundreds of machines at a time.
[6592.5s] And it was just amazing.

Unknown Speaker 02:
[6594.9s] One thing I struggled to remember—how did they communicate that the network was ready to launch?

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6601.6s] Was it like Twitter, email?
[6605.1s] Like, how did we even know?
[6607.3s] Like, we kind of knew—I think it was like, we knew from the commits that it was close.
[6611.2s] This is why I brought it up before.
[6612.6s] They're like, okay, they're slowing down.
[6614.2s] They're getting ready, you know, but—

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6616.9s] I don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty involved in ConsenSys at those days and everybody was talking about it.
[6624.1s] And there were like multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining.
[6628.0s] And so there was no—there was no missing it at the time.

Alex Van De Sande:
[6631.0s] Yeah.
[6633.4s] Yeah, sorry.
[6635.8s] Sorry, like—like I said, I think there was—but like, I think they announced the date, but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not.
[6643.9s] Right.
[6644.4s] And it turned out they did.
[6645.4s] Like, that did turn out to be the date.
[6647.1s] But like, everyone was kind of gearing up.
[6649.3s] But we were also like getting ready, like, oh, you know, it might not happen that day.
[6653.6s] It might be a couple of days later.
[6655.2s] It could be a couple of months later.
[6656.6s] We just weren't sure.

Unknown Speaker 03:
[6658.5s] Yeah.
[6659.9s] Oh, man, those—
[6661.6s] Those are some times for sure.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6665.6s] Yeah, OK, so I think this is a good wrapping point for this first episode.
[6671.1s] Hopefully, we'll see if we get any feedback from the internet at large on whether we should keep going down this path.
[6678.5s] But quite the journey already—lots of interesting things I’ve even remembered in the course of our couple hours here.
[6689.8s] Thanks, guys.
[6691.0s] It does feel like we should keep going with the story, but we’ll see.
[6695.0s] Let's leave it as a cliffhanger—all of the excitement to come.
[6698.8s] Any final words?

Alex Van De Sande:
[6700.7s] Well, I think, you know, it’s funny—even if you look at the beginning, you see the same patterns now where there’s this huge amount of inflow.
[6712.1s] And then, you know, what seemed at the time like tons of hype, but now is like a trickle of hype.
[6719.6s] And what seems like tons of capital, but now would be considered a trickle of capital.
[6724.9s] And then like a kind of overconfidence and then, you know, a tightening—but then, you know, real technical stuff gets done in the tightening.
[6733.2s] It’s funny how that pattern has played out so many times now.
[6736.5s] Yeah, exactly.
[6739.7s] It's a funny type of cycle.

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6740.6s] I’ll tell you about the time we saw Vitalik throw his shirt at someone.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6744.1s] Oh, that’s a good story.

Possible Jim (SPEAKER_01):
[6745.7s] Yes.

Unknown Speaker 04:
[6746.1s] It's Alex’s shirt story—it’s a good one.
[6749.1s] All right.
[6750.3s] Let’s end it here.
[6751.3s] Thanks, guys.
[6752.3s] You know, we’re doing this recording on a Sunday.
[6755.0s] Hope it entertains and informs the wider world.
[6758.6s] And we’ll see you next time.
