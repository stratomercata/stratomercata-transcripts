**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:00] Okay, welcome everyone.
[00:02] We have a very special topic today.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:04] You can find me usually on Twitter for the Ethereum people. Chr Yench, of course.
[00:10] I have a complicated name. Not many vocals in there, but you find it.
[00:15] Or of course on LinkedIn. Actually from my company. I'm more active on LinkedIn, which I was never before, but that's what we get our clients.
[00:23] Let's tokenize it. Yeah, but usually you can find me on Twitter. Follow me there on LinkedIn.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:26] Fantastic.
[00:28] Well, thank you for all your contributions to that success.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:30] Likewise.

**SPEAKER_01:**

[01:06] Have a great day.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:08] You too.
[01:10] That's great.
[01:12] Talking to you by.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:14] Me too.
[01:16] I'm looking forward to it and as of now, and I don't intend any change, stick to Ethereum.
[01:20] I love the community I continue building and try to get a lot of people using it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:24] Have you been to every devcon?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:26] Yes, I said yes, I've been to every defcon.
[01:30] The last one was actually the first song that I didn't give a talk and also went to every ECC except of one where there was Covid.
[01:40] There was a reason they couldn't come, but yes, I'm actually, I intend to continue to come to every defcon.
[01:50] It's like you meet the people like Thrift Queen, Left Terrace, of course, Vitalik and many others.
[02:00] It's just a sweet spirit there. Nice community.
[02:10] Love seeing how it all grows. Listen to those exciting talks.
[02:20] I mean, it's for tokenizers. It's not as relevant.
[02:30] It's not like our customers or it's a tech.
[02:40] Of course.
[02:50] We're just doing an ERC. 20 tokens on Ethereum.
[03:00] It's super easy.
[03:10] No deep tech.
[03:20] Sometimes I miss doing deep tech, but, well, I just enjoy being there, seeing what it all.
[03:30] What all happened and remembering those magic days.
[03:40] And just like only once in a lifetime or two times in a lifetime, you have this.
[03:50] This moment where everything comes together. The right time, the right place, the right people.
[04:00] This certainly where those like one and a half years I worked for Ethereum, but definitely like the prime of my career in terms of who I work with, what we accomplished, the impact we had on the world and this sweet cyberpunk spirit there and what we did there.
[04:10] It was really great.
[04:20] I always sometimes get emotional thinking about this and meeting those people again at defcon.

**SPEAKER_01:**

**SPEAKER_01:**
[7:10:00:00] Me too.
[7:20:00:00] I'm looking forward to it and as of now, and I don't intend any change, stick to Ethereum.
[7:30:00:00] I love the community I continue building and try to get a lot of people using it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[7:40:00:00] Have you been to every devcon?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[7:50:00:00] Yes, I said yes, I've been to every defcon.
[8:00:00:00] The last one was actually the first song that I didn't give a talk and also went to every ECC except of one where there was Covid.
[9:00:00:00] There was a reason they couldn't come, but yes, I'm actually, I intend to continue to come to every defcon.
[10:00:00:00] It's like you meet the people like Thrift Queen, Left Terrace, of course, Vitalik and many others.
[12:00:00:00] It's just a sweet spirit there. Nice community.
[14:00:00:00] Love seeing how it all grows. Listen to those exciting talks.
[16:00:00:00] I mean, it's for tokenizers. It's not as relevant.
[18:00:00:00] It's not like our customers or it's a tech.
[20:00:00:00] Of course.
[22:00:00:00] We're just doing an ERC. 20 tokens on Ethereum.
[24:00:00:00] It's super easy.
[26:00:00:00] No deep tech.
[28:00:00:00] Sometimes I miss doing deep tech, but, well, I just enjoy being there, seeing what it all.
[30:00:00:00] What all happened and remembering those magic days.
[32:00:00:00] And just like only once in a lifetime or two times in a lifetime, you have this.
[34:00:00:00] This moment where everything comes together. The right time, the right place, the right people.
[36:00:00:00] This certainly where those like one and a half years I worked for Ethereum, but definitely like the prime of my career in terms of who I work with, what we accomplished, the impact we had on the world and this sweet cyberpunk spirit there and what we did there.
[38:00:00:00] It was really great.
[40:00:00:00] I always sometimes get emotional thinking about this and meeting those people again at defcon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[42:00:00:00] Fantastic.
[43:00:00:00] Well, thank you for all your contributions to that success.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[44:00:00:00] Likewise.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[45:00:00:00] All the best.
[46:00:00:00] Okay.
[47:00:00:00] Oh, just one more.
[48:00:00:00] Where can we find you?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[49:00:00:00] You can find me usually on Twitter for the Ethereum people. Chr Yench, of course.
[50:00:00:00] I have a complicated name. Not many vocals in there, but you find it.
[51:00:00:00] Or of course on LinkedIn. Actually from my company. I'm more active on LinkedIn, which I was never before, but that's what we get our clients.
[52:00:00:00] Let's tokenize it. Yeah, but usually you can find me on Twitter. Follow me there on LinkedIn.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[53:00:00:00] Excellent.
[54:00:00:00] Okay, thanks so much.

[182:00:00:00:00] Have you been to every devcon?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[183:00:00:00:00] Yes, I've attended every DevCon since the beginning. It's always a great experience meeting new people and learning about the latest developments in Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[184:00:00:00:00] That sounds amazing! What are some of your favorite memories from past DevCons?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[185:00:00:00:00] One of my favorites was the first DevCon in 2016. It felt like a gathering of pioneers and visionaries who were all excited about the potential of Ethereum. Another memorable moment was when Vitalik Buterin announced some groundbreaking changes during one of his talks.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[186:00:00:00:00] That must have been really inspiring! What do you think is the most significant impact DevCon has had on the Ethereum community?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[187:00:00:00:00] DevCon plays a crucial role in fostering collaboration and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. It brings together developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to share ideas, solve problems, and push the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain technology.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[188:00:00:00:00] Absolutely! Do you have any advice for someone who is new to Ethereum and wants to get involved in the community?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[189:00:00:00:00] Definitely start by attending events like DevCon or local meetups. Engage with forums, social media groups, and GitHub repositories related to Ethereum projects. Contributing code, writing documentation, or participating in discussions are great ways to get started.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[190:00:00:00:00] Thanks for the advice! It's clear that DevCon is a valuable event for anyone interested in Ethereum. Looking forward to seeing you there!

**SPEAKER_01:**
[191:00:00:00:00] Likewise! Can't wait to see what this year's DevCon brings and connect with everyone again.
