VICTOR WONG:**
[0.4s] The stream is live.

BOB:**
[3.9s] The stream is live.

VICTOR WONG:**
[6.5s] Don't cross the streams.
[9.7s] Who are you going to call?
[11.1s] We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams.

BOB:**
[14.0s] Yes, exactly.
[15.2s] Okay.
[15.6s] We seem to be also live on X.
[20.1s] So welcome everyone to another
[25.2s] group chat by the... mutual support group chat.
[31.7s] Yes, exactly.
[36.6s] With the builders from Straum Mercado, I'm Victor Wong.
[39.6s] I am founder and Chief Product Officer at Straum Mercado.
[43.5s] Bob, who are you?

BOB:**
[45.1s] Hello, I'm Head of Ecosystem.

VICTOR WONG:**
[48.3s] And Kieran, who are you?

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[50.1s] Kieran James Lubin, CEO. Once a coder, you know, long time off.
[57.6s] Coded a little again.
[58.8s] Vibe Coding Era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there.
[67.0s] But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff.

VICTOR WONG:**
[70.3s] Yeah, I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing like the cursor move around by itself.
[82.0s] Both miraculous and disturbing.

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[86.0s] It moves really slow.
[87.8s] It does.

VICTOR WONG:**
[88.9s] It takes time to do stuff.
[91.1s] But you just kind of keep it running in the background.
[94.0s] Anyways, today's topic—getting us back to the topic at hand—is basically: are corporate chains back?
[102.9s] And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of
[111.0s] the rise, and perhaps fall, and maybe the rise again of corporate chains.
[115.9s] Hey hey hey, Lewis, nice to have you.
[120.6s] But maybe you can—maybe, Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains, as they're called, like what's happening currently.
[131.4s] And then we can look back over the history of corporate chains.

BOB:**
[136.6s] Yeah, well, I mean, you know, the
[140.9s] red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo.
[147.4s] So Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which—just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves–including Anthropic, Coupang, I'm not going to say all these, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI,
[175.9s] Revolut, Shopify, and Visa.
[180.4s] So yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa—you know you're doing pretty well on that payment side.
[190.8s] And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in,
[197.5s] on the Ethereum side is—you know—this is going to be another EVM chain.
[203.0s] So it's kind of like, "Thanks for the work guys.
[207.2s] We'll do a corporate version now." And you know, so specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up
[223.3s] Ethereum stack stuff, you know, kind of being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem. Carried out a few, you know, VC-nasty moments, but essentially
[233.8s] building, you know, a really good new Rust client, right?
[242.7s] They do some of the best tooling, you know, with Foundry, right? You know what you had going on in earlier years—we've made a better one.
[252.3s] I think there's about three or four areas where they built Ethereum stack stuff. Almost like, "Hey, here's a full stack Ethereum stack.
[264.2s] But actually, we're going over that.
[267.9s] We've got the answer and we can just do a new chain deployment and off we go."
[273.4s] So yeah, that's not been received terribly well.
[277.7s] Also, big brain drain, you know—they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high-profile people.
[287.8s] Dankrad Feist—one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof-of-stake transition—you know, years of work.
[296.6s] You know, him as a primary guy and he's off, you know, to get his paycheck. Fair play to him.
[303.8s] You know, a number of other people as well.
[305.3s] But that's been the current, you know, fire.
[311.0s] As Guatiguat said, this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

VICTOR WONG:**
[322.0s] Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain.
[327.9s] Like, you know, obviously, Robinhood is launching an L2.
[332.0s] I think it's an L1.

BOB:**
[336.7s] Yeah, so Arbitrum stack.
[339.5s] But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1.
[343.6s] They've sort of talked about various bits on that.
[346.2s] Circle announced ARC.
[350.2s] They're not content to be a—
[354.1s] stablecoin on other chains.
[356.3s] It's like, "Right,
[356.9s] we're going to do our own chain as well." I mean, Base—you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase, again,
[368.9s] they haven’t had a token. But, you know, there's your straight path into Coinbase.
[374.3s] Tether has a chain or soon, right?

UNKNOWN:**
[377.5s] I—

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[378.8s] I think they announced something.

BOB:**
[380.7s] Maybe.
[381.2s] I mean, they started out, you know, before Ethereum stuff was going right.
[385.8s] So there's Omni—that was previously MasterCoin, you know, super ancient tech, 2013-era.
[391.6s] But then, you know, they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains.
[395.7s] But yeah, like having their own totally—you know—
[399.2s] is something that makes sense.
[400.4s] And I mean, you've had Binance Chain—you know, BNB—for years.
[406.2s] Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now.
[411.5s] Uniswap has a chain.

VICTOR WONG:**
[413.4s] Yeah, yeah.
[415.2s] But I don't think of those as corporate chains.

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[418.6s] Like, it's really hard to tell, right?
[420.8s] It's like, is it for us, by us?
[424.3s] Or is it sort of like, you know, somehow I see the Stripe chain as like the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, where it's like—
[436.1s] and I kind of see Base that way a little bit, where I feel somehow less bad about Binance Chain, even though Coinbase in some ways is like a better actor than Binance.
[448.4s] But very much, Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me, you know, whereas—

BOB:**
[455.2s] I mean, these lines are quite arbitrary.
[458.5s] Yeah.
[459.3s] You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week, you know, about Ethereum alignment.
[466.1s] You know, what does that even mean?
[468.1s] It's like, "So these guys, they're Ethereum-aligned, so it's okay?"
[473.2s] So it's okay.

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[474.3s] I think what it means—I mean, it's a strange thing that’s going on in which—let's take it to Bitcoin for a second.
[484.0s] I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the maxi mentality in which like, you know, there will only be Bitcoin.
[496.3s] There's only one sincere crypto asset—you know, everything after is a scam.
[505.6s] And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin.
[513.4s] Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

VICTOR WONG:**
[520.0s] It's like we believe in open markets—but we should be the only market.
[527.2s] There should only ultimately be a single market.

BOB:**
[530.4s] It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.
[538.6s] Because it's like, "No, no, this is all about freedom from the man, right?"
[541.9s] You know—yeah, you can't tell me what to do.
[544.5s] Permissionless chains—yeah.
[546.1s] But not like that.

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[547.1s] Everything here—just in this one approved location.
[551.2s] Yeah.
[552.5s] So I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon.
[557.2s] I mean, I get it also.
[558.4s] I guess like, I'm—
[563.1s] I'm a kind of a believer in the more permissive open-source software licensing. Like, at the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as like GPL sort of forcing the
[578.2s] commercial efforts to accrue back one place. And, you know, the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent. You know, and perhaps maybe it out-competed because it had a
[595.4s] benevolent dictator genius—but maybe it outcompeted in part because of the virality of the license.
[602.1s] And this is not to say—I think there's a mix of licensing regimes.
[606.4s] I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software—some of it permissive, some not.
[613.7s] But
[615.2s] you know, it's sort of—part of it’s also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn’t really have any need for a job per se at some point.
[633.7s] And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing.
[642.2s] It's a strange sort of religiosity also.
[644.9s] And I think we experienced it even back in 2015—even like any deviation from Ethereum principles was looked askance, you know.

VICTOR WONG:**
[656.8s] Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition.
[659.0s] Maybe we can—
[660.6s] You know, we—as BlockApps and Strato—went in, you know, with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in a corpo-chain direction.
[671.3s] Maybe, like, you can talk about why we did that and what happened there.
[677.0s] So we may be partly to blame for this.

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[680.0s] Partly to blame.
[681.3s] You know, it was barely on purpose.
[684.2s] So rolling back in 20…
[689.6s] let's say late 2014, our CTO Jim and I—mostly Jim—started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum.
[701.0s] And he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could, like, sync the testnet. You know, and there were some chat groups, a Slack, there was a bit of a—the yellow paper, I guess, was out at that time.

BOB:**
[712.9s] I found an exact date for this actually.
[715.3s] So Jim’s first commit was mid-September 2014.
[719.5s] The yellow paper had been out about April.
[725.5s] Really?

KIERAN JAMES LUBIN:**
[726.2s] Yeah.
[726.7s] Gotcha.
[727.6s] Yeah.
[728.1s] And he might've been working on it for a while before he pushed anything.
[732.3s] I think I would have gotten back…
[735.5s] So we met up—we got introduced by a previous co-founder of Jim’s who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum.
[745.5s] And we probably spoke the first time, June, July, something like that.
[751.8s] And we met up
[753.6s] in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts.

[1052.6s] And the interesting thing is, at that time, the real development seemed to be happening by these
[1060.5s] corporates in these innovation labs versus independent labs.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1065.3s] Yeah, that's right.
[1066.0s] It felt like, okay, they would come to you with a PowerPoint describing the billion-plus dollar problem that they had.
[1073.8s] This is after all the NDAs were signed and all that sort of thing.
[1076.6s] This was very convincing.
[1078.1s] Some of the use cases were bad, but a lot of them were like, oh, okay — you have some really complicated multi-organization settlement problem that you handle with spreadsheets or some ancient system, and it costs a ton of money.
[1091.9s] And if you could actually upgrade it, it would be way better, potentially.

[1096.4s] And the vast majority of those did not work out.
[1100.0s] But it wasn't like they identified the wrong problem.
[1103.4s] It was more that the will to implement across a corporation or multiple corporations — this big consortium era — was probably the issue.

[1113.5s] And to some extent, I know we want to talk a little bit about Libra — regulatory barriers as well in certain cases.
[1121.9s] Yeah. So again, we at first wanted to be just like the public net API — like Alchemy or Infura now.
[1135.5s] And I think we were just a little early for that.
[1139.1s] And then also, we were going to the effort of maintaining a whole client, which was challenging because things kept changing — as they continue to do.
[1147.6s] But we got very much pulled in this "let's run our own network" direction by the corporates.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1155.1s] And I think part of it was, at that early time, they couldn't hold ETH.
[1160.9s] So they were like, "We will do all these things, but we can't hold ETH. Can you make
[1165.5s] a version where we don't need to do it to do all these things?"

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1168.7s] Yeah, I totally forgot.
[1169.6s] It was like Treasury didn't know what to do.
[1171.8s] Pretty much like, "No, we've got our procedures.
[1175.9s] We can't — you know — it has to get in the ERP.
[1178.9s] We can't have a line item for that."
[1181.0s] And, you know, just not compatible.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1184.4s] I remember with RSDB, who became Monax and so on — so they started in 2014 as well, when it was still on POC5, before the mainnet.
[1197.9s] And there you had a situation of a company being set up by lawyers who really loved the smart contract functionality.
[1207.9s] But nothing to do with that.
[1209.8s] It's like, ETH is probably a legal security.
[1212.1s] "We don't want to get anywhere near that."
[1214.7s] It really was the "blockchain, not Bitcoin" being the phrase at the time, right?
[1222.9s] Blockchain — not Ethereum, not Ether.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1225.8s] But the one thing that was really interesting: when we launched that Blockchain-as-a-Service, and it got on Azure, we had thousands of people spinning up stuff.
[1235.9s] And then a good number of them reaching out to us.
[1238.6s] And I will say — the use cases that didn’t seem speculative did come from these corporates, right?
[1244.5s] Like, to Karen’s point — we did get contacted by sort of smaller groups, but they were like, "Oh well, we just want to launch our own token and sell it," like that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1255.7s] That came a little later, actually. I think once a couple of ICOs had happened, suddenly everyone wanted to pay someone to build their thing for an ICO.
[1270.0s] But that was kind of more like a 2016 to 2018 phenomenon, I would say.
[1274.4s] Yeah, that's true.
[1275.0s] The corporates came first, actually — which was good.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1277.6s] Yeah, exactly.
[1278.6s] And so, I mean, you know, that was our experience.
[1281.9s] And shortly afterwards — and Bob, you might have the timing — Libra by Facebook came along.
[1288.6s] And they were doing their own thing.
[1291.0s] Do you know the time?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1292.0s] Yeah, it was ’18–’17.
[1294.4s] Yeah, we launched Blockchain-as-a-Service in 2015.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1296.6s] Right.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1297.2s] And it's 2015.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1298.8s] I'm feeling like it was 2016.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1301.0s] But no, it was later, I think, wasn’t it?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1304.4s] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1305.6s] Um, here we go.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1307.6s] As the resident historian of all things blockchain...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1310.7s] Here we go.
[1311.0s] June the 18th, 2019.
[1313.8s] Oh yeah.
[1314.7s] Isn’t that right?
[1316.4s] Yeah.
[1316.9s] At that point, Meta — then Facebook; this was before they even turned into Meta —
[1322.6s] you know, announced it, which was a stablecoin project intended for global payments via its applications — sorry, via its apps.

[1333.7s] So what you had there — and the other thing worth saying about Libra — is Libra is not an EVM project.
[1343.5s] You know, they had their — I guess, you know, they're happening like five years later.
[1347.4s] So it’s like, "Let’s apply all of our learnings of what's worked and what has not worked over that five-year period," especially about smart contract security and, you know, having a constrained model.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1362.7s] Their language seems pretty good to me, actually — but no one uses it.
[1367.6s] We're stuck with Solidity, which will be the JavaScript-slash-COBOL of the
[1373.1s] crypto age. We're never getting rid of this thing.
[1375.6s] That's it.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1376.2s] Well, and you know, I think the EVM has become the standard, right?
[1380.4s] That's just — I mean, Red Wong was mentioning that last week.
[1384.1s] And I think that is true, basically, to a certain degree.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1388.2s] Yeah, yeah.
[1388.5s] I mean, I think it’s the JavaScript, it’s the C — it’s good enough that stuff got made on it, and it’s never going away.
[1397.9s] Yeah, it's good.
[1398.3s] But, you know, this stuff is going to be there forever—or like...

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1403.0s] Sorry.
[1403.8s] Yeah.

[1404.3s] But the launch of Libra — they had super high-profile partners, if I recall.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1409.4s] Very similar, actually, to the kind of — it was mostly payment networks and notably no banks.
[1417.1s] It felt like a
[1419.2s] tech company-driven disintermediation play.
[1425.5s] Like, "Well, if we just had these stables, then we wouldn’t have to have the bank account at the edge too."
[1432.1s] And we could just — and I think this is kind of what killed it, right?
[1435.8s] The banks each called up their representatives and just screamed about big tech.
[1444.3s] Here’s a list.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1448.9s] So: Facebook, Uber, Spotify, Andreessen Horowitz, Anchorage (bank/depository custody), Lyft, Xapo, Coinbase, Union Square Ventures.
[1465.5s] So yeah — it's actually a crappier list by far than Tempo.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1471.9s] You know, MasterCard was in until like the last second.
[1476.9s] People started making regulator noise and they dropped. I think maybe Visa too.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1483.5s] So I guess that gets into the question — like, why didn't that work, right?
[1487.8s] And I think we touched — like, I recall Mark Zuckerberg having to talk to

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1494.0s] Congress?

[1496.0s] I just found these exits.
[1498.3s] So the major exits out of that were: PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Stripe, eBay.
[1506.1s] And they all dropped out super fast, didn’t they?
[1511.2s] And I mean, I think it was a mixture of things.
[1515.4s] This is my thought — maybe you guys have different thoughts.

[1516.5s] Firstly, everyone hated Facebook because they had just had the Cambridge Analytica stuff.
[1522.9s] It was like, "We're not going to trust you guys — no."

[1528.1s] But then the second one was regulatory stuff — because it was kind of going up against the dollar, right?
[1534.8s] It was like, "We're going to have a basket of things."
[1539.2s] So it wasn’t just a straight stablecoin.
[1542.0s] It’s like, "Oh, we're kind of having a go at the US dollar."

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1546.5s] And they cut the banks out of it, too.
[1548.8s] That’s the third point.

[1553.1s] And also, the banks are fond of making their —
[1559.3s] I guess they're called market utilities —
[1562.0s] their bank-owned industry cabals, like SWIFT, the DTCC.
[1567.3s] A lot of the exchanges are like this.
[1570.3s] I guess even the — I don’t really understand how that works.
[1572.7s] Even the Fed is bank-owned. But basically,
[1575.4s] the banks pooled a bunch of capital a long time ago,
[1578.2s] and they set up this thing that you kind of have to use.
[1582.5s] And the profits from using that thing go back to them.
[1588.0s] And it's also a choke point.

[1591.3s] Under other circumstances, you would have some sort of antitrust issue in doing this.
[1598.0s] It’s kind of definitionally collusion.
[1603.6s] But you also need these things to make the whole thing function.

[1610.6s] But it seemed like when tech attempted to do that itself, the banks still had the ear of the relevant parties.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1619.9s] I mean, that's happening here again, right?
[1623.5s] It’s almost the same people.
[1627.7s] And it's basically saying, right — the banks and the credit card companies, to a lesser degree, own these pipes.
[1636.3s] And we had to sit on top, kind of, and service.
[1639.8s] Yeah.
[1640.6s] How about if us fintech, techie companies — the Silicon Valley ones instead — how about...

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1652.1s] I think it would be cool if it happened.
[1653.8s] By the way, though I'm a bit of a big tech hater, I always thought Libra was at least cool.
[1661.9s] It would be interesting.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1664.1s] I mean, the technology behind it — it was UTXO-based, but it seemed pretty good.
[1670.8s] They did a good job from the technology side.

(SPEAKER_01, SPEAKER_04, etc. continue...)

[1974.6s] And that's still a problem on the public nets, et cetera.
[1981.2s] But it's sort of just like, you kind of have to let it be, embrace it.
[1989.2s] They would have had to turn it on persistently
[1994.2s] at small volume and then like kind of let it grow and fix the problems as they went.
[2001.8s] And what they instead wanted was like a totally complete product that fits perfectly in their current workflow and existing regular... like one thing people really are using, or seem to sincerely be using, is stables for global internal clearing and settlement.

[2024.1s] We actually, uh, you know, the—I won't say the names—but we competed for (didn't win) a project for, like, a big—call them a utility that’s global—to do that.
[2035.7s] And the use case was actually really good.
[2037.6s] And they had such tremendous volumes that dealing with the currency fluctuations was a giant line item that they had to deal with.
[2046.9s] Yeah.

UNKNOWN:**
[2047.3s] And.

Kieran:**
[2047.7s] They wanted a permissioned chain for it.
[2050.6s] You could just do it with stables today.
[2052.9s] That’s why there will always be a little bit of demand for non-USD stables.
[2058.4s] But you may as well just use the public chains to move money around the world now.
[2065.8s] And then you could build from that into various other use cases.
[2069.4s] I believe Stripe even does this.
[2070.9s] I think I’ve heard them say that.

UNKNOWN:**
[2072.8s] And PayPal does it.
[2074.0s] PayPal does it.

Kieran:**
[2075.1s] And that’s what they would have needed to do.
[2077.7s] And instead, it was like they had to go very top-down—there’s budgeting, setting up legal entities, maybe investing in a consortium, very tight rules about how the data can flow, which data, all that sort of thing.
[2097.5s] And it sort of leads to a strangulation, where you would kind of just need to let it bloom a little bit.

[2103.3s] And that’s what the public chains did.
[2107.7s] They also had the incentive mechanism.
[2109.8s] It's not like there's a ton of corporate usage of public chains now, although I guess there's some institutional-style financial usage that's now quite large.

[2120.6s] But even for that, I think you'll see some corporate operational stuff—again, the stablecoin global clearing and settlement/remittance stuff is starting to get there.
[2134.0s] I think that will happen the way I described, as opposed to… again, these folks all have done extremely heavy IT implementations.
[2146.4s] I’ve heard that, at least in the era when Oracle and SAP were big at it, on average, an ERP implementation takes 5% of global revenue, no matter the size of the group.

[2157.6s] So like the bigger you are... I think, Victor, maybe you mentioned to me once that you were working on one for like a full decade.

Victor (SPEAKER_04):**
[2166.2s] When I started at a company, they had already been working on an SAP implementation.
[2174.5s] And when I left six years later, they were still working on it.

Kieran:**
[2177.9s] So it was just like… you know, the project.
[2182.1s] It’s hard to do things incrementally in corporate. In part it's because it’s super complicated and very regulated and whatever, but it’s also mentality too.
[2190.2s] Like, just kind of turn it on, and then just start it.

[2195.5s] I mention this is what happened with the cloud.
[2197.2s] Like, they’re like, “All right, let me just do this one little thing.”
[2201.3s] And it’s easy, and you keep just putting more and more up on there.
[2204.0s] And now you have—I think JP Morgan turned almost all of its on-prem stuff off and it’s all on Amazon or... all on—you know, and so I think that was the problem.

[2209.8s] The consortium model really means you gotta pre-think and have multi-party agreements with everybody—and then the negotiation was endless.
[2220.0s] It’s hard to do the data modeling. I think that was the problem at its core.
[2240.0s] But I think it came down to if the corporations had just had this “let’s play with it” mentality I’m describing.

Victor:**
[2241.8s] Yeah.
[2242.4s] Bob, what do you think? Do you have any view to add on?

Bob (SPEAKER_01):**
[2245.7s] Yeah.
[2246.7s] I think a lot of it is just technical maturity as well.
[2250.8s] There wasn’t really any ZK back then.
[2253.1s] So it’s like, how do you do privacy?
[2255.3s] How does that work?

[2257.0s] That’s how Quorum came into existence—Amber and the team at JP Morgan wanted to do something.
[2268.4s] And without a privacy story, it was never going to get approved.
[2272.2s] They wouldn’t be allowed to do anything.
[2275.0s] So it was like, okay, what’s the thing we could do?
[2277.4s] Okay, we can have a private database off to the side, and you just do hashes on mainnet, and the other bits are permissioned.
[2286.4s] So it’s kind of like—there's a workaround for it.
[2289.5s] But they did that with open eyes, knowing the ZK stuff is coming, just not there yet.
[2295.6s] We have to do some hacky thing, otherwise we’re literally not going to be allowed to do anything.
[2300.7s] I mean, this was a story.

Victor:**
[2302.5s] I think that’s true too.

Kieran:**
[2306.2s] While I agree with you, I still think everyone who found that deficiency—none of them solved it better, really, than what exists in the public chains out there today.
[2320.8s] I keep asking the AIs and looking around the internet on the state of ZK—having still not really arrived. Maybe a little bit.
[2332.8s] And the enterprises all want the following permissioning model:**
[2334.0s] Like yeah, I should be able to send value to Victor.

[2339.2s] He should know that whatever I have really exists.
[2343.7s] He should be able to send it on to you.
[2347.2s] You should be able to verify that Victor had it, but not know that it came from me or how much he has total.
[2353.2s] And the regulator should somehow be able to see all of this—at least in a financial services setting.
[2358.0s] And it mostly still can't do that.
[2361.4s] I kind of can't really tell... I think Zcash is the closest.
[2366.4s] And then there are various ZK things, but mostly...

[2373.7s] A lot of the ZK is for efficiency—like throughput—as compared to privacy at this time.
[2383.3s] But that use case still can’t really be done.
[2387.0s] There are some hints that there’s a Cosmos—which you never hear about—project that kind of does that.
[2392.1s] I have a summary I think I’ve sent you before, but it’s still not there.
[2398.2s] But they are using it, right? Like Stripe is moving money around the world.
[2400.6s] So I think...
[2401.6s] I also think it’s the rigidity of mentality actually being a bigger factor.

Bob:**
[2406.5s] Totally.
[2407.0s] I mean, the other tech piece there is scaling though, right?
[2410.6s] Yes.
[2411.0s] Because at that time, it was like, yeah, you’ve just got the Ethereum mainnet and everything’s gotta go on it.
[2415.8s] So it’s like, useless.
[2417.3s] But we’ve got a way better L2 story now.

Victor:**
[2421.5s] So that’s... Well, I kind of think the fundamental problem from my point of view is like,
[2429.4s] they don’t think of themselves like communities and they don’t want to share.

[2433.3s] Right.
[2433.6s] So like, when I talk about tokenomics, I think tokenomics provides you a system where participants can get everything.
[2440.5s] So, you know, not to go into names of the projects, but we built some very large consortium chains.
[2446.7s] And then at some point every single one of those chains said, “Oh, well, we need data from this source that this group of people have.”
[2455.5s] And then the question is like...
[2458.3s] Why would that group—shippers or whatever—provide that data?
[2462.9s] And there are always answers like, “Oh, we’ll just force them to do it.”
[2468.1s] But it never worked.

Kieran:**
[2470.4s] This is a big reason.
[2472.3s] And I guess this is in part what I meant by mentality.
[2476.3s] But yes, the incentive alignment specifically was a huge problem.
[2480.0s] A lot of the time it’s like: either one of them wants the thing way more than the others and is willing to pay for it—one of the three.
[2488.0s] Yeah.
[2489.0s] Or there’s the Walmart/IBM thing that didn’t go anywhere.

Bob:**
[2492.6s] Yeah.
[2493.5s] Maersk as well.

Kieran:**
[2494.5s] Or a bunch of parties have roughly equal interest in the thing, but then no one really wants to pay for it.
[2504.0s] It gets treated like a utility—“let’s pay cost recovery”—and it's slow.
[2511.2s] There’s not the urgency to get those sorts of things done.

[2514.3s] And in both cases, you have big trouble attracting the rest of the value chain.
[2519.8s] And so we concluded you just had to turn the thing on and let them come in as they’re ready.
[2528.3s] One way or another.
[2529.9s] And I think it’s worked the best in public chains because there’s sort of a common token, if you will, and people are excited about the value of that token rising.

[2541.7s] By the way, this goes back to, like, other than technological deficiencies—why do people
[2549.4s] decide to stick with Ethereum or do something else?
[2551.7s] And it’s like, what’s going to make the most money?
[2554.2s] Ethereum’s got a lot of assets on it.
[2556.4s] Maybe you can get some of them.
[2557.6s] Maybe you should just sit there.
[2559.9s] But if there’s something you’re just bumping your head against and can’t quite
[2565.4s] figure out how to... you might have to go leave. Which, you know, plenty of people have experienced that.

Victor:**
[2572.7s] Yeah. And it’s true for any real platform, like the app stores, right?
[2576.3s] Everyone, myself included—we built for iOS first because they figured out payment, they figured out micropayments really quickly, so we could get paid for what we did, right?

[2586.6s] So, okay, here’s a question that we’ll close out on:**
[2591.3s] Are the new round of corporate chains the future, or are they DOA based on similar problems?
[2597.6s] I’ll start with Bob on this one.

Bob:**
[2601.2s] They are not solving the same problems as truly permissionless ecosystems.
[2607.8s] However, it’s not a winner-takes-all either.
[2613.9s] So I think maybe the losers here are going to be the banks.
[2621.2s] They can get their business eaten a lot easier than this can cannibalize Bitcoin or Ethereum, I think.

Victor:**
[2631.2s] Okay.
[2631.9s] Kieran, your verdict?
[2633.0s] Good question.
[2633.7s] DOA or are they the future?

Kieran:**
[2635.8s] I think we’ll get a couple long-lived corporate chains.
[2639.2s] I agree with that.
[2640.6s] I think they'll be semi-niche.
[2643.4s] I mean, I think of SWIFT as a corporate chain.

Victor:**
[2647.2s] Yes.

Kieran:**
[2648.0s] DTCC—corporate chain. They just happen to not be using a blockchain.
[2653.5s] And both of them are sort of trying to, right?
[2656.3s] So we’re not going to completely get rid of that.

[2660.1s] I think they won’t go huge. They might actually be enormous volume,
[2665.0s] but I probably will never be allowed to run a validator on one.
[2675.6s] I agree also that they’re not going to siphon that much value from public chains.
[2682.5s] I think the tech may be similar—backend pipes from your bank account when Stripe launches bank accounts
[2697.8s] versus your MetaMask account—but there’s not really going to be that much intermingling between the two.
[2706.1s] One will have bearer assets, one largely will not.
[2713.1s] And the uncensorability is really important at the end of the day.

[2721.2s] So yeah, I don't think they'll go away.
[2723.7s] I think it's very slow.
[2726.9s] I think the most immediate failure mode on all of these is political.
[2733.1s] Like if we see a big flip around, they’ll get killed again, whereas the permissionless chains will maybe suffer in price a little bit—but probably not.

[2747.2s] But I am surprised that the banks...
[2752.4s] I mean, they’re already trying to rewrite the Genius Act to prevent Coinbase from offering rewards.
[2759.8s] And one way or another, the banks are finished—either from the fintechs or crypto or both.
[2770.6s] The big ones will be around and are kind of tech companies anyway, but it is only regulatory capture protecting them at this point.

Bob:**
[2776.9s] Yeah.
[2777.6s] I mean, I think it is both because payments is quite different from lots of other things happening on the blockchain side, right?
[2784.3s] Savings, store of value, dApps...
[2789.2s] You're not going to run dApps on Tempo.
[2793.5s] You’re not going to save your money in TempoCoin.

Kieran:**
[2797.4s] Right.
[2798.2s] I mean, I agree. There will not be a lot of DeFi on Tempo, for instance, because it’s too closed of an environment.
[2808.5s] You won’t get the compositional aspect of things—probably because they won’t allow it.
[2813.2s] In theory you could, but you won’t.

Victor:**
[2815.8s] Yeah.
[2816.6s] So my view is that the projects that might succeed in this space have to have two properties.
[2823.4s] One is they have to be driven by at least mostly one company.
[2830.6s] I don’t think this idea of “the bigger names we have all together” works. We’ve experienced this—it just slows everything down, to your point.

Kieran:**
[2838.4s] A lot of grandstanding legal departments.

Victor:**
[2841.5s] It sounds good but operationally it’s terrible.
[2845.8s] But the other thing is that they have to have that sort of community mindset from the start.
[2851.7s] I think things like Base and Binance Chain have been able to do this because they brought a Web3 mentality, even though they drove it at first.
[2863.4s] And so I think the projects are likely to kind of evolve on those kinds of projects—that would be my prediction.

Bob:**
[2870.0s] And I guess also because their customer base are crypto-y people—that’s a similar kind of group.

Victor:**
[2876.6s] And you understand those demands, right?

Bob:**
[2880.3s] Tempo will be going for retail.
[2882.3s] It’s going to be normal retail—Apple Pay, Tempo Pay.

Kieran:**
[2886.4s] Yeah.
[2886.9s] You’re not going to know you’re using Tempo, most likely.
[2890.2s] I guess the banks could really suffer, or it could be the credit card networks that really suffer.

Victor:**
[2897.8s] I think the first victim is SWIFT, really.

[2903.0s] On that note, I'll give a quick preview to everyone.
[2905.6s] Let's wrap up today's conversation.
[2908.5s] Thank you for joining us.

[2910.4s] Quick preview for next week.
[2912.3s] We have Brian, founder of Pistachio Phi, joining us next week
[2916.9s] to talk about, you know, starting a new project.
[2921.1s] And his background — actually, he was previously an employee at BlockApps, so we know him very, very well.

[2928.0s] So if you want to find us, we're always doing this every week.
[2932.5s] But if you want to find me, you can find me on X at Vic4Wong.
[2938.4s] You can find out why I have the "4" in my name.
[2941.7s] Bob has posted that on our Telegram — thanks.
[2944.2s] Bob, where can people find you if they want to hear more from you?

Bob Summerwill:**
[2947.2s] So yeah, again, X.
[2949.1s] So, Bob Summerwill.
[2950.8s] "Summer," like the season.
[2951.9s] "Will," like write your will.
[2953.8s] That’s me.
