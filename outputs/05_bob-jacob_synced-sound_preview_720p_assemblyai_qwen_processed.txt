[00:03] You

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:05] I was thinking about the early days of Ethereum, and specifically around 2015 when things were just getting started.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:10] Yeah, that period was really interesting. The community was small but incredibly passionate.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:17] I remember the funding squeeze in early 2015 and how it affected the Ethereum Foundation's plans for DEF CON 1.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:24] Consensus stepped up to fill that gap, and DEF CON 1 ended up being a pivotal event for the community. It was held in November 2015 in London.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:36] For me, it was amazing. I attended every talk from morning until evening. The energy was incredible.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:47] It was a full day of ideas and visions. People like Fabian Fogelstella and Alex Van Hasande presented the early ERC 20 token standard, which has become such an integral part of Ethereum now.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:03] I remember the Raiden network presentation getting a lot of positive feedback. It was one of those moments that made me realize this is where my future lies.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:15] The technology focus at DEF CON 1 was so intense. There were no side events or parties, just people talking about tech and sharing ideas.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:27] It felt like everyone there was genuinely inspired by the potential of Ethereum. People only talked about technical aspects and future possibilities.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:40] There were a few booths, but mostly it was just people sitting together, discussing ideas over dinner or pie.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:53] The contrast between DEF CON 1 and later events is stark. By DEF CON 2, there were already parties and side events.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:07] And by DEF CON 3 in Cancun, the scale had grown significantly. There was a lot of money involved, which changed the dynamic completely.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:24] Looking back at those early days, it's clear how much has changed. But for me, DEF CON 1 remains one of my best memories from this period.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:39] It was inspiring to see so many people with such innovative ideas and a genuine passion for the technology.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:54] I recently found out that someone I met later on had also been at DEF CON 1. He mentioned trying to get Geth running on his machine, which was quite challenging back then.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:10] It wasn't easy getting things up and running in those early days. Even with the developers nearby, it could take days to set everything up.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:25] But despite these challenges, everyone was excited about the potential of Ethereum. That enthusiasm is what really drove the community forward.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:40] It's amazing how far we've come in just a few years. From DEF CON 1 to where we are now, it's been quite a journey.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:56] Thanks for chatting about this with me. It’s always great to reflect on those early days and the impact they had.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:08] You're welcome. All the best to you as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:13] Same to you!
