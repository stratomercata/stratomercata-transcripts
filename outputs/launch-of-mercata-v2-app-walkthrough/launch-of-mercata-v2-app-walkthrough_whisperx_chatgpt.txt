SPEAKER_03: You've been live for real.

SPEAKER_00: We are live, yes.

SPEAKER_03: We're live and we're live. So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the... burning at the stake, I guess, of Guy Fawkes, who was the guy who tried to blow up the Parliament in the mid-17th century. Oh, the V for Vendetta guy. V for Vendetta, so that's based on that.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, the poem says "Remember, remember" right in the first line.

SPEAKER_03: That's right. So basically the deal there was that I guess annually you had like the King giving the speech in front of the Parliament. So you had like basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They were stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on Bonfire Night to celebrate that it didn't happen. And yeah, so you have a, you know, like a doll or whatever, that's the guy that you put on the fire. So anyway, happy Bonfire Night everybody, happy Bonfire Night. We should probably introduce Michael because he's a special guest.

SPEAKER_00: Absolutely, yes. See, I guess he's a guest. I mean, we'll make him a regular, I assume. But yeah, guys see me on the Telegram.

SPEAKER_00: Michael, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I work on the sales side of the team. I'm going to be introducing the app today to you guys and I hope you're excited.

SPEAKER_00: Well, you work sales, you're a dev, you're a front-end dev, you do a bunch of different stuff on the team.

SPEAKER_03: Got the moves. Let me just kick off. Hi. Hello, everybody. Welcome, welcome. So we did it. We launched V2. It happened. How does that feel, man? I think Bob, you may not be as tired. Oh, did— oh, he's gone away. Okay, he's frozen. He was filming, yes, well.

SPEAKER_00: There are a lot of sleepless nights and working through weekends. Oh, you are back.

SPEAKER_02: He was back. It was my problem. Okay. Yeah, it started spinning everything for a second, and then you all came back. Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: Take it. So how's V2 being live? How does that feel?

SPEAKER_02: Much better than before. You know, it's still... never— it's a funny thing. Do you ever feel like good for like a sustained period? Like I think not. But extremely happy that it's live. I think it would be maybe interesting for the audience to go into a little bit of like what it is and also like why it took so long. So we, through the end of 2024, we started to realize that there was a lot of demand for DeFi-type features. So basically, Marketplace version one—Mercado version one, if you will—was more NFT-ish. We had interesting and exotic things that might be numbered and a breadth of them. So this was— we had carbon offsets trading on there, whiskey barrels. Michael moved a lot of collectible shoes through the system. So truly, you know, fairly unique, at least down to like having a serial number or sometimes very unique stuff. So there was occasional one-of-ones on there. We dipped our toes into the art market a little bit with some collabs. And also more financialized stuff, too. So the medals in particular being something that we've had for a long time. And we kind of saw the most demand for the most financialized items. And it sort of led us to realize what people want from this technology. I mean, one way or another, I think in the course of the company, obviously we did very enterprise stuff, a lot in the supply chain, and that kind of actually led very naturally to the unique item focus. But you know, often everything in the blockchain space pulls back to some sort of financialization. And we kind of decided to stop resisting this impulse, you know, as the market seemed to be demanding it. So we released— the other thing we realized is that in some ways, say your goal is to tokenize everything, like you want all manner of real-world value to be on-chain, existing alongside truly digital-native assets like Bitcoin, ETH, and so on. What would get the world to do that? And we thought the answer was making liquid trading markets where they didn't exist prior. And that is definitely still part of it. But I think it is more about debt than it is about selling or transacting. Right. And so we kind of on Marketplace version one created a mechanism whereby you could borrow against collateral. It was sort of primitively done, but you could do it within the system and it got great uptake. And then we said, all right, let's just make this stuff a little more DeFi. And it just turned out that we were not expecting to do a relaunch. In fact, we were bringing folks on through Q1 and Q2 and TVL was rising and, you know, etc., more loan volumes and all that sort of thing. But we realized that we were hitting the limits of the system pretty quickly and that it would be just, you know, that we needed to at least change some of the way the internals worked. And, you know, we did a listing of our gold token with a small exchange. It was a good experience to work with them, but they had a hard time dealing with things as they were and found that just everyone wants the ERC-20 style. And that to make the capabilities, you know, sort of show the best of DeFi, it was like a huge, huge effort that turned into a full relaunch, which was never the goal at the outset. You know, happy to be on the other side of it. The system is definitely way better. It's a little bit different. There are some areas where we kind of took a shortcut on version one that made it kind of easy, and we've gone and made it, say, more decentralized now, which is definitely better, but there could be like rough edges around it. As a for instance, we often had fixed pricing on Marketplace version one or pure spot pricing, and we have swap pools now, which is great in that they let the market determine the price and get third-party liquidity in and so forth. But then there's just more variability on any given trade execution. And so though these things will all sort of work themselves out over time, but huge effort. It's way better, way better. But we ended up in more of a different place than I intended at the outset. Let me just throw it over to say Victor just on all this.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think the thing is that really, I think our core insight was really if you think about how people in the real world really accumulate wealth, it's really through like small accumulation over time of interest. You know, like think about a savings account, a retirement account, all these things. People aren't like day trading constantly, right?

**[08:04] UNKNOWN:** So—

SPEAKER_00: What we realized is that, you know, it wasn't enough to simply be able to buy new exotic or not even exotic, but tokenize things in the real world, but really to turn those into things that were revenue-generating for you individually and earning over time. So it should, you know, you should be able to have multiple ways except for trading to earn things. And we realized that DeFi had kind of answered this, but it did it in a way that was too complicated for the vast majority of people to understand. I mean, you know, it was only a year ago that Vitalik himself was like, someone needs to explain to me where DeFi yields are coming from, right? Like if he couldn't understand it, you know, how could the rest of the world kind of get into it? And we wanted to build a system that would allow the rest of the world to really kind of get those DeFi earning potentials. And, you know, I think there were two things that really came out of it. One is that we had to kind of combine the pool of assets to not just be about real-world assets, liquid real-world assets, which we started with, but we also had to bring in, you know, high-quality crypto assets. And then the second thing is that we had to offer different paths of earning. Like you could be able to put some of those assets into a liquidity pool that you would lend out to other people and get interest on that. You would be able to go into swap pools and see when their price is different. You should be able to earn directly if you put some of your things into a savings account that people can offer. So basically, V2 offers all of those paths for users, which we're really, really excited about.
