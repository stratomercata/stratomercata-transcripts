SPEAKER_03:
[0.7s] We're live for real.

SPEAKER_00:
[3.1s] We are live, yes.

SPEAKER_03:
[5.0s] We're live and we're live.
[8.9s] So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night, or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the...
[30.7s] burning at the stake, I guess, of Guy Fawkes, who was the guy who tried to blow up the Parliament in the mid-17th century.
[42.3s] Oh, the V for Vendetta guy.
[44.3s] V for Vendetta, so that's based on that.

SPEAKER_00:
[49.2s] I mean, the poem says, "Remember, remember," right in the first line, right?

SPEAKER_03:
[54.3s] That's right.
[55.4s] So basically the deal there was that, I guess, annually you had the king giving the speech in front of the Parliament, you know,
[65.2s] so you had basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall.
[71.5s] They were stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute.
[81.1s] So then there you go.
[82.9s] You now have a burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on Bonfire Night to celebrate that it didn't happen.
[92.7s] And yeah, so you have a doll or whatever that's the guy that you put on the fire.
[99.9s] So anyway, happy Bonfire Night, everybody.
[103.9s] Happy Bonfire Night.

SPEAKER_00:
[105.8s] We should probably introduce Maiko, because he's a special guest.
[109.1s] Absolutely, yes.

SPEAKER_02:
[112.0s] I guess he's a guest.

SPEAKER_01:
[115.1s] We'll make him a regular, I assume.
[117.7s] You've seen me on the Telegram.

SPEAKER_00:
[119.3s] Maiko, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

SPEAKER_01:
[122.2s] Yeah, I work on the sales side of the team.
[124.8s] I'm going to be introducing the app today to you guys, and I hope you're excited.

SPEAKER_00:
[128.9s] Well, you work sales, you're a dev, you're a front-end dev—you do a bunch of different stuff on the team.

SPEAKER_03:
[136.4s] Got the moves.
[140.8s] Let me just kick off.
[142.6s] Hi.
[143.1s] Hello, everybody.
[144.5s] Welcome, welcome.
[146.1s] So we did it.
[148.1s] We launched V2.
[149.5s] It happened.
[150.2s] How does that feel?

SPEAKER_02:
[153.5s] Man, I think, Bob, you may not be as tired, you know.

SPEAKER_00:
[161.4s] Oh, he's gone away.
[165.1s] Okay, he's frozen.
[167.7s] He was filming.
[169.6s] Yes, wow.
[170.9s] There were a lot of sleepless nights and working through weekends.
[177.0s] Oh, you are back.

SPEAKER_02:
[178.1s] He was back.
[179.2s] It was my problem.
[180.8s] Okay.
[181.6s] Yeah.
[182.1s] It started spinning everything for a second and then I—and then you all came back.
[187.3s] Um, yeah.

SPEAKER_03:
[190.8s] So how's V2 being live?
[193.8s] How does that feel?

SPEAKER_02:
[195.7s] Much better than before.
[198.2s] You know, it's still—
[200.8s] It's a funny thing.
[202.6s] Do you ever feel good for a sustained period?
[206.8s] I think not, but I'm extremely happy that it's live.
[211.9s] I think it would be maybe interesting for the audience to go into a little bit of what it is and also why it took so long.

[224.3s] The end of 2024, we started to realize that there was a lot of demand for DeFi-type features.
[234.4s] So basically,
[236.6s] Marketplace version one—or Mercado version one, if you will—was more NFT-ish.
[244.9s] We had interesting and exotic things that might be numbered and a breadth of them.
[252.4s] So we had carbon offsets trading on there, whiskey barrels.
[258.4s] Maiko moved a lot of collectible shoes through the system.
[263.2s] So truly,
[265.7s] fairly unique—at least down to like having a serial number—or sometimes very unique stuff.
[270.6s] So there were occasional one-of-ones on there.
[273.3s] We dipped our toes into the art market a little bit with some collabs,
[278.0s] and also more financialized stuff, too.
[281.7s] So the medals in particular have been something that we've had for a long time.

[287.3s] And we kind of saw
[290.6s] the most demand for the most financialized items.
[295.5s] And it sort of led us to realize what people want from this technology.

[301.0s] I mean, one way or another, you know, I think in the course of the company, obviously we did very enterprise stuff—a lot in the supply chain—and that kind of actually led very naturally to the unique item focus.
[313.5s] But, you know, often everything in the blockchain space pulls back to some sort of financialization.
[321.2s] And we kind of decided to stop resisting this impulse, you know, as the market seemed to be demanding it.

[328.9s] So we released—the other thing we realized is that in some ways,
[336.5s] say your goal is to tokenize everything—
[339.5s] like you want all manner of real-world value to be on-chain, existing alongside truly digital-native assets like Bitcoin, ETH, and so on.
[351.6s] What would get the world to do that?

[353.9s] And we thought the answer was making liquid trading markets where they didn't exist prior.
[360.0s] And that is definitely still part of it.
[361.8s] But,
[363.4s] I think it is more about debt than it is about selling or transacting, right?

[369.4s] And so we kind of, on Marketplace version one, created a mechanism whereby you could borrow against collateral.
[381.6s] It was sort of primitively done, but you could do it within the system.
[386.1s] And it got great uptake.
[388.4s] And then we said, all right, let's just make this stuff a little more DeFi.

[397.2s] And it just turned out that we were not expecting to do a relaunch.
[403.3s] In fact, we were bringing folks on through Q1 and Q2 and TVL was rising and, you know, etc., more loan volumes and all that sort of thing.
[413.7s] But we realized that we were hitting the limits of the system pretty quickly and that we needed to at least change some of the way the internals worked.

[431.4s] So we did a listing of our gold token with a small exchange.
[437.2s] It was a good experience to work with them.
[439.3s] But they had a hard time dealing with things as they were and found that just everyone wants the ERC-20 style.
[450.1s] And that to make the capabilities really show the best of DeFi, it was a huge, huge effort that turned into a full relaunch, which was never the goal at the outset.

[467.1s] You know, I'm happy to be on the other side of it.
[470.5s] The system is definitely way better.
[472.3s] It's a little bit different.
[474.5s] There are some areas where we kind of,
[480.4s] took a shortcut on version one that made it kind of easy,
[484.1s] and we've gone and made it more decentralized now, which is definitely better, but there can be rough edges around it.

[493.4s] For instance, we often had fixed pricing on Marketplace version one or pure spot pricing.
[499.5s] And we have swap pools now, which is great in that they let the market determine the price and get third-party liquidity and so forth.
[507.9s] But then there's
[509.1s] more variability on any given trade execution.
[514.8s] And so these things will all sort themselves out over time.
[520.4s] But huge effort—way better, way better.
[524.5s] But we ended up in more of a different place than I intended at the outset.

[530.5s] Let me throw it over to, say, Victor, just on all this.

SPEAKER_00:
[535.8s] Yeah, I think the thing is that really—I think our core insight was if you think about how people in the real world really accumulate wealth, it's through small accumulation over time of interest.
[561.7s] You know, think about a savings account, a retirement account—all these things.
[565.3s] People aren't day trading constantly, right?
[567.7s] What we realized is that it wasn't enough to simply be able to buy exotic—or not even exotic, but tokenized—things in the real world.
[575.5s] But really to turn those into things that were revenue-generating for you individually and earning over time.
[583.2s] So you should be able to have multiple ways—apart from trading—to earn.
[589.5s] And we realized that DeFi had kind of answered this, but
[594.0s] it did it in a way that was too complicated for the vast majority of people to understand.
[600.2s] I mean, you know, it was only a year ago that Vitalik himself was like, "Someone needs to explain to me where DeFi yields are coming from," right?
[607.7s] If he couldn't understand it, how could the rest of the world kind of get into it?
[614.2s] And we wanted to build a system that would allow the rest of the world
[619.1s] to really access those DeFi earning potentials.

[623.7s] And I think there were two things that really came out of it.
[628.2s] One is that we had to combine the pool of assets to not just be about real-world assets—liquid real-world assets, which we started with—
[634.6s] but we also had to bring in high-quality crypto assets.
[641.8s] And then the second thing is that we had to offer different paths of earning.
[648.6s] Like being able to put some of those assets into a liquidity pool that you would lend out to other people and get interest on that.
[655.4s] You would be able to go into swap pools and see when their prices are different.
[660.1s] You should also be able to earn directly if you put some of your things into a savings account that people could offer.
[667.6s] So basically, V2 offers all of those paths for users, which we're really, really excited about.

SPEAKER_03:
[676.1s] Yeah, I mean, the point you were making about trading specifically, Victor—you know, sort of a stat I've repeatedly said parroting from a prior project—was that
[688.5s] only about 5% of people who try and day trade actually make a profit. Most people are terrible—absolutely terrible—at trading because you just end up trading your emotions, right?
[699.2s] You're scared at the wrong time, you're not brave at the right time.
[702.5s] It's very, very easy to put yourself in a worse position.
[713.3s] So having passive yield is absolutely a big need for a huge amount of people.

SPEAKER_00:
[719.5s] Yeah.
[720.1s] I was really surprised that even in the crypto world, the amount of people that had exposure to DeFi was relatively small.
[727.9s] And I think people didn't understand how well established those patterns have gotten.
[735.6s] It's funny that Vitalik has just woken up to this. After, like, last year saying he didn't understand, now he said the future of Ethereum is going to be based on low-risk DeFi, right?
[748.2s] So that's what we're really talking about.

SPEAKER_03:
[750.1s] Well, the EF are using DeFi themselves now, finally.
[752.8s] Exactly.
[753.7s] For like 10 years, they were just market dumping to raise funds.
[757.9s] And now it's like—they're finally using the thing that’s kind of gotten built here because of Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00:
[764.5s] Well, and the world fundamentally—insurance, support—runs on credit, right?
[769.2s] And DeFi has really solved the collateralized lending component in a way that is so seamless. Like, where else can you get a loan in minutes?
[783.2s] A place where you could do that in a reliable fashion.
[786.7s] And I think it does it in a way that allows it to be much more transparent than, say, typical financial institutions.
[794.8s] So the people that are benefiting from those loans are the other users, which is really exciting to us.

SPEAKER_03:
[803.0s] So, I mean, how would you say
[805.8s] V2 is different than existing, you know, other big-name DeFi protocols?

(Transcript continues…)

[1035.3s] Let's say it's fast confirmations that are irreversible and that sort of thing.
[1042.6s] And it just gives you the latitude to make the user experience as good as possible, which will be a continual battle.
[1049.0s] But it's been a real step-function change from both our old stuff and what's out there today.

SPEAKER_03:
[1055.8s] Well, should we take a look?
[1057.2s] Let's take a look.
[1058.2s] Let's take a look.

SPEAKER_01:
[1059.2s] Oh, I guess I'm off.
[1060.8s] All right.
[1062.0s] Share my screen.
[1071.0s] Okay, everybody see my screen?

SPEAKER_00:
[1077.2s] Yes.
[1078.2s] Great.

SPEAKER_01:
[1078.5s] So we're going to start with bridging in tokens.
[1081.6s] There are two ways to do it.
[1083.2s] The normal bridge.
[1084.3s] First, you have to connect your wallet, of course—using MetaMask here.
[1087.7s] There are two ways to do it.
[1090.5s] If you want to bridge in ETH or any kind of wrapped Bitcoin, PaxG—oh, I think we have something else I forgot—but
[1098.9s] you bridge it into this.
[1100.4s] If you want to bridge in stables, I would go through the convert feature—that will mint on-bridge.
[1107.2s] So we're going to bridge in USDC.
[1108.6s] This is the testnet, by the way. If you want to try it out, just go to this link.
[1113.6s] And if you want to get some test USDC, Aave has some test faucets for USDC and USDT.
[1123.9s] But let's bridge in like a hundred bucks.
[1130.1s] Maybe let's do USDC, get USDT.
[1134.5s] Bridge it in, confirm, confirm—minting.
[1134.5s] So I bridged them in before just because it's a bit of a process, but you can also check the status here.
[1140.7s] Takes a little bit for the server to update there, but there's an earlier one I did that completed.
[1147.4s] So let's just assume that it's already in here.

SPEAKER_00:
[1151.3s] We should be aware that delays are not on the Mercado side.
[1157.2s] It's on the Ethereum Sepolia side.

SPEAKER_01:
[1160.0s] Yep.
[1161.1s] So we're going to swap some right now.
[1162.8s] Let's swap some USDT.
[1164.7s] Let's do, like—I don't know—10.
[1167.5s] Let's get some EFST. Swap.
[1176.1s] And also, gas is used through USDST on our app as well.
[1180.3s] Similar to Hyperliquid, actually.

SPEAKER_03:
[1184.2s] And what do you pay?
[1185.8s] What do you pay?
[1186.7s] What do you pay?

SPEAKER_01:
[1188.4s] It depends on the transactions, but some are one cent to three cents, depending on what it is.
[1194.8s] If it's three cents, it's probably three transactions in there.
[1197.7s] Yes.

SPEAKER_02:
[1198.2s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_01:
[1198.6s] Yeah.
[1198.9s] Usually, like—I believe a transfer—no, not a transfer.
[1204.2s] A bridging is two transactions, if I'm not mistaken.

SPEAKER_02:
[1209.6s] Although yes, if you bridge in, you get minted vouchers.
[1213.6s] So the vouchers just give you free transactions—one-to-one with the cents, I suppose.

SPEAKER_01:
[1219.4s] Yep. Vouchers—you can track here as well.
[1221.9s] And it's a cool little widget.
[1225.6s] Anyway, so I swapped some assets and vouchers, just to clarify.

SPEAKER_03:
[1230.1s] So that's kind of a little nice hack to get past the “Oh my God, I haven't got any
[1239.1s] ether for gas on this chain at this time,” right?

SPEAKER_00:
[1245.0s] Yeah, exactly.
[1246.2s] It's an onboarding thing, right?
[1248.8s] Like, yeah—that's one big limitation on a lot of chains, right?
[1252.7s] You can't even do your first transactions on most of them until you have the native token.
[1259.2s] So this allows us to bring people on without requiring that.

SPEAKER_01:
[1263.2s] Yep.
[1263.7s] So we've done the swaps.
[1265.1s] We're going to add some liquidity.

SPEAKER_00:
[1267.1s] I just want to mention—if you can go back to the swap.
[1269.7s] One really important thing with our system is it allows you to see the exchange rates—
[1272.5s] both internally, but also like the global exchange rate.
[1280.5s] That's where you see "Exchange Spot" right under there.
[1283.5s] So that's the global rate.
[1285.9s] This is something we learned from two of our trading contests.
[1289.0s] Where—like, you know—the
[1292.9s] arbitrage opportunities—you can see from these two things directly, instead of having to go somewhere else to figure it out.

SPEAKER_02:
[1299.4s] It's been funny on the live system.
[1303.3s] For those who have used DEXs—you find that if there's not that much liquidity,
[1312.7s] you can definitely push the price as reported and provided by the DEX off of the true market price.
[1320.8s] And here, we're combining a couple different data sources to get the spot price, and that's just coming through an oracle.
[1327.7s] Really, here it's just a reminder—the spot price is used for the health calculations when you borrow.
[1337.1s] The reason you want to do that is—
[1338.4s] someone could do a big trade on one of the pools, manipulate that price, and then liquidate someone or etc.

SPEAKER_00:
[1347.0s] As we saw very recently with the Balancer attack.

SPEAKER_02:
[1350.9s] Yeah, yeah.
[1354.2s] But it's also just a reminder to get good execution.
[1357.7s] So, for those who go try this on the live net, just make sure, you know—
[1362.8s] don't do huge trades on there just yet, because liquidity is still coming in—both from us and externals—
[1369.1s] to make sure you get good execution.

SPEAKER_01:
[1375.4s] Yep.
[1375.5s] And yeah, just—the pool is not really relevant to the oracle price, but everyone should keep that in mind as well.
[1382.8s] Anyway, we'll get back to the pool.
[1384.3s] So, these are the lending pools that contribute to the borrow/lending, which we'll get to in a little bit.
[1390.5s] I can deposit a hundred in here.
[1397.2s] And then it should mint me some MUSDST tokens, which is my pool token—
[1402.6s] representative of my lending pool contribution.
[1405.2s] I believe that is in these Non-Earnings right here.
[1405.3s] So let's also contribute some money to the swap pool so you can earn APY.
[1413.7s] Let's see what looks juicy right now.
[1415.1s] The silver—wow.
[1418.0s] Someone confirmed my deposit.
[1433.7s] And we are deposited and we're earning APY.

SPEAKER_03:
[1436.5s] And you're depositing both SILVST and USDST?

SPEAKER_02:
[1442.1s] That's right.
[1442.6s] When you input to a swap pool, you need to put in both pairs.
[1447.1s] And we have two modes here.
[1448.8s] It's probably just better to use the A and B mode.
[1452.2s] But you can do a single-sided liquidity add.
[1456.0s] What it does is it performs a swap so that you have an equal amount of the other one,
[1460.8s] and then it deposits it.

SPEAKER_03:
[1462.6s] So yeah, it's a convenience if you want to get into it, but you haven't got the right stuff.

SPEAKER_01:
[1470.7s] That's correct.
[1471.4s] Yeah—the button's right here for everyone who wants to do it single-sided, if they choose to do so.
[1478.3s] And let's see—we're going to do some borrowing.
[1482.7s] So I'm going to supply my whole ETH stack—$14.
[1487.9s] All of it.
[1488.7s] Don't do it all.
[1489.4s] Do all of it.

SPEAKER_02:
[1490.9s] He'll be okay on the gas, though.

SPEAKER_01:
[1496.2s] So I have—let's see—I have $14.
[1499.6s] Oh, we've got to hide some of these.
[1502.5s] $14.90 here.
[1504.2s] Because the LTV, I believe, is about 75%.
[1508.1s] I have $11.

SPEAKER_02:
[1511.1s] You don't need to go all the way up to the LTV.

SPEAKER_01:
[1514.1s] Let's go all the way.

SPEAKER_00:
[1518.4s] This is risky.

SPEAKER_01:
[1523.9s] My hope—always be careful.
[1528.2s] Once you hit 1.0, you can get liquidated.

SPEAKER_00:
[1530.2s] But we can also recommend—basically—we can always just repay it.

SPEAKER_01:
[1538.8s] And it should update here.
[1540.9s] Buyer's remorse: instant refund, please.
[1544.7s] Overall, that’s the app.
[1546.0s] It's kind of a combination of Uniswap and Aave—for those of you more familiar with Web3.
[1552.1s] If you have any questions or want a deeper walkthrough, feel free to message me on Telegram and we can hop on Zoom.

SPEAKER_02:
[1558.0s] Yeah.
[1558.1s] There you go, guys.
[1559.6s] Also, for the gold and silver bugs out there—we take physical deposits in addition to supporting some of the popular—
[1568.4s] well, actually, there’s no—
[1570.0s] as far as I know—there’s no really popular silver token other than ours.
[1574.6s] But we’ll take PAXG right now and soon the Tether gold coin as well.
[1581.2s] That can drive your borrowing power within the system.
[1584.8s] You can borrow and then turn around and lend—CDP path—and that will make your gold into a productive asset.
