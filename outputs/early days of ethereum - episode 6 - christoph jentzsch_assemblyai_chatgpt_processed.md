**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Okay, recording is in...
[00:01] Pro is in progress...
[00:02] It says so.
[00:03] Hello everybody.
[00:04] Today, delighted to have Christoph Jentzsch with us.
[00:08] We did attempt to record this, Christoph and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button.
[00:13] So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded.
[00:17] So this is round two.
[00:18] Hello Christoph, how are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:20] Hi everyone.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:22] Nice to meet you again.
[00:23] I'm doing good.
[00:24] I hope you too.
[00:26] Thanks for the invitation.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:28] Fantastic.
[00:29] Christoph and I—our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch.
[00:36] And this was around the time that Christoph was still at the Ethereum Foundation.
[00:41] And then I think our paths have crossed a number of times since, and Kieran's too.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:44] Indeed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:45] So Christoph, what were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:52] So the journey started in 2013.
[00:55] I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics, actually about self-organizing systems—so like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things.
[01:02] I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior.

[01:06] And I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency.
[01:11] But the reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs—graphic cards—and the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs.
[01:21] And so that's how I got into Bitcoin mining.

[01:24] I bought my first Bitcoin, got into this bubble, read everything I could about it.
[01:28] Then I came across the whitepaper from Vitalik—early 2014, something like January or February, in some Bitcoin forum somewhere.

[01:34] I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decentralized currency with all the characteristics and features.

[01:40] And this whitepaper of Vitalik—if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy.
[01:43] Except for NFTs, everything is in there: DAOs, ENS—like domain name systems—all of that.

[01:48] For me, it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but not just a currency—everything else.
[01:55] Then I started reading everything about it.

[01:57] In 2014, actually still 2014 in summer, I remember the crowdsale was in 2014, right?
[02:03] Yeah, the crowdsale was around July–September.

[02:04] So around the time of the crowdsale, I watched a video from Gavin Wood—he was somewhere in Scandinavia, some conference in the Nordics.
[02:10] He talked about Ethereum—I loved it.

[02:12] And he said, "We want to open up an office in Berlin, looking for C++ developers."
[02:15] I was a C++ developer.
[02:17] In theoretical physics, it's 90% software development.

[02:21] So I said, "Well, I want to do this."
[02:23] I took my parental leave time, plus some vacation time, and paused my PhD for like three or six months.
[02:29] I said, I'll return after I'm done.

[02:30] I thought this was just a short project.
[02:32] They raised money, maybe six, twelve, eighteen months, then it's over.

[02:36] When I started, I thought maybe three to six months, then I'd go back to the PhD.
[02:39] So I worked there with Ethereum's Gavin Wood—was a great time—and then just decided to stay.
[02:44] It was so exciting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:46] So you never got to be a doctor?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:48] No, I'm not a doctor.
[02:49] I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left, which was kind of a pity.
[02:53] I worked for three years on that.

[02:55] But I also had, at the time, I think four or five kids—I needed some money.
[02:59] I didn't get much money as a PhD student, so I did software development as a side hustle basically.

[03:05] When I got this project, I said, "Well, let's do this for two or three months as part of parental leave time, then I can return."

[03:09] I decided to really interrupt my PhD, thinking I’ll return maybe a year later.

[03:13] I thought the Foundation will eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits, they just raised donations, they spend them, and then it’s over.
[03:18] That was the original plan, but it just turned out different.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:21] I mean, I guess it's never too late, right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:23] I actually sometimes think about if I should return.
[03:26] But there’s so much to learn again.

[03:28] I'm right now doing TokenizeIt—I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies.
[03:32] It works very well.
[03:34] So currently I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:36] No, because I mean famously you had, you know, Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian Reitwiessner as well, and I think there were a couple of other PhDs too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:43] Definitely.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:44] I also dropped out of mine.
[03:46] I was actually in mathematical physics too—similar background.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:48] It's actually the same—it’s theoretical physics, the mathematical part of physics.
[03:51] I enjoyed it very much.
[03:52] I did thermodynamics and statistics mostly.
[03:54] Software development was really fun.
