Kieran James-Lubin:**
[0.0s] All right.
[2.2s] Well, welcome back, everybody.
[4.0s] The first episode of the Early Days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter.
[14.3s] I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video.
[23.1s] And there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content.
[28.6s] One of them called it essential viewing.
[34.7s] So anyway, we're back for another episode.

[39.8s] So to remind everybody, I'm Kieran James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders.
[46.0s] Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

Victor Wong:**
[48.3s] Oh, OK.
[48.8s] I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[54.8s] I'm James Ramos Dia, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[61.8s] All right.
[62.4s] Thank you.
[63.6s] And so I believe where we left... So I can't watch
[68.4s] video of myself.
[69.9s] So I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch.
[76.8s] And there were some things we left out, even prior to launch, that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the post-launch activity.
[87.1s] So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

Victor Wong:**
[97.5s] Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building what in those days were known as dApps.
[111.3s] I guess some people still call them that, but that term seems to have fallen out of favor—with "blockchain applications" being more common now.
[115.9s] So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum.
[124.4s] That was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small co-working space in Greenpoint, I think.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[134.3s] It was actually in Williamsburg.
[138.2s] It was called Green Desks, maybe.

Victor Wong:**
[140.3s] Green Desks.
[141.3s] Yeah, that’s right.
[142.3s] Yeah.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[142.4s] It’s right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[147.2s] Exactly.
[147.9s] Yeah, that’s right.
[148.8s] And of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time.
[151.9s] In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise.
[155.7s] I looked up one day and there was a big, well-manicured park there.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[160.0s] Yeah.
[160.8s] Well, they kind of walled it off.
[162.0s] So it just looked like an abandoned site.
[166.2s] And then one day, all of a sudden, the wall was gone and there was a beautiful park there.

Victor Wong:**
[170.1s] So at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say, the concepts were really interesting.
[186.0s] People were coming up... and it was mostly interns who were interning at ConsenSys over that summer.
[191.9s] And ConsenSys at this point was only maybe 20 people, max.
[196.5s] Twenty or thirty, yeah.
[197.5s] It was really, really small.
[200.0s] And some great concepts came up, but even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time.
[210.7s] It was just impossible.
[213.1s] Very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible.
[219.3s] You couldn’t read the state off the blockchain and all of this kind of stuff.

[221.9s] So that kind of led into...
[225.0s] Yeah, like everything—building in those days—was incredibly hard.
[230.7s] And that led into... so we decided at that event we were going to, at the launch of Ethereum, do a bigger hackathon.
[239.8s] And that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum.
[246.8s] And it included us, the Java client—which I think was called Ether.Camp at that time—
[253.8s] and other tools that were kind of combined together.

[259.4s] But what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger. I think the first one had like six participants. The second one had around 30.
[270.4s] But it introduced a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly.
[275.6s] Like the winner was a GameFi app,
[278.6s] like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay.
[282.6s] There was a decentralized social app, I think called Truthr or something like that.
[288.9s] And then there was a traceability supply chain app, even in those early days.
[293.7s] And that kind of all coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[299.2s] Yeah, so OK, so you're talking about the second one.

Victor Wong:**
[303.2s] I'm talking about the second one, yeah.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[304.4s] The second one—also, the offices had shifted.
[307.2s] So ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which I believe they still have a presence in—though they’ve gone mostly remote.
[325.1s] I remember there was like a horse lineage app...
[328.4s] Yeah, yeah, interesting. You know, and we ended up actually hiring a couple of people who participated in the hackathon.

[335.5s] But that one was open to externals, right? That was the difference. And it actually was quite well-attended.
[345.1s] The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall.
[353.0s] Do you think that one was 24 hours or two days? I can’t remember.

Victor Wong:**
[359.4s] I think it was two days.
[360.5s] And yeah, like the air conditioning thing...
[362.3s] So we moved into that space to have the hackathon.
[366.4s] ConsenSys was expanding because they had outgrown that co-working space already.
[370.7s] And so we moved into that space, which was a reasonably sized room.
[375.6s] You could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room.
[378.7s] But yes, the air conditioning was terrible.
[380.5s] And we had to frantically—we only realized this after we got into the room—
[386.6s] so we had to frantically buy some and set them up.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[389.7s] Okay, I do have a memory of that.

Victor Wong:**
[392.0s] Yeah, I don’t know if you recall that,
[393.6s] but yeah, we were trying to get those air conditioning units in place before other people showed up.
[400.2s] Because yeah, we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[404.3s] These were the scrappy days—manually configuring air conditioning.
[408.2s] I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for how scrappy you are in your startup journey.

Victor Wong:**
[416.5s] There was a lot of furniture.
[418.2s] It was basically an empty room when we moved in there.
[422.5s] And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started.
[426.5s] So we had to get everything up and running.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[429.1s] And was this to sort of commemorate the launch, I think? Or was it right before the launch?

Victor Wong:**
[438.4s] It actually... you know, if you recall at the time, we didn’t know when the launch would be.
[444.7s] The dates were always shifting, right?
[447.5s] And we kind of arbitrarily chose a date—we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch—but because we couldn’t know exactly when the launch was,
[458.5s] and even when they declared the date, it was still a little vague.
[461.6s] We were like, is that actually going to happen?
[463.7s] So we kind of at some point had to arbitrarily choose the date—and they more or less got it right.
[472.2s] I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[475.3s] Jim, I might’ve asked you this last episode, but I’ll ask again.
[478.1s] Do you remember: one, trying to predict the launch and could you explain how?
[482.8s] And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen—
[487.8s] because it’s hard for a decentralized group to decide on a launch time.
[491.8s] I can’t remember that at all.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[493.2s] You were mentioning it in the last video and I didn’t remember it, but I don’t doubt it.
[496.9s] It sounds correct.
[498.2s] You were saying we were looking through the Git commits at the time.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[501.7s] Yes, you know you make this plot—it was like commits by day.
[505.8s] And as the commits... and you extrapolated it forward. I think you probably got within a couple days of the launch date.
[513.5s] OK, so I have to... yeah, I still don’t know how they set the clock on the first block, so to speak.
[520.8s] Maybe we can dig this up.
[522.4s] There was something they did,
[524.0s] and we had probably in our DMs.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[526.1s] I wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had.
[532.4s] Maybe the graph is in there.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[534.0s] Yeah.

Jim Ramos Dia:**
[534.7s] Yeah, that’s very funny.

Kieran James-Lubin:**
[535.7s] The Slack is a treasure trove of interesting things.
[540.4s] Um, all right.
[543.3s] So yeah, so it launched, and I kind of felt like there was a sort of “and then... what’s going on?” You know, it took a little time for things to get going.
[557.2s] And then, you know, obviously it’s been a smashing success, right?
[561.3s] It’s just the reality of a new platform.
[563.7s] You sort of get it out there,
[565.5s] see what people do, you learn from it.
[568.5s] And it took a minute for the activity to kick in.

[…continued in further edits if needed…]

**SPEAKER_03:**
[894.0s] But in any case, I guess Augur then blazed the trail sort of after Ethereum did with its successful crowdsale,
[901.8s] for the wave of ICOs that came later.
[906.7s] But yeah, so Truthcoin was also this competing project.
[909.4s] I just remember meeting up with Matt at like a Berkeley coffee shop and talking about both Augur and Truthcoin had some sort of
[919.0s] you know, machine learning–slightly like computer science graph theoretic–way of determining what the truth was. So like, you take a bunch of votes from a bunch of people but then determine the principal components of how the voting is and extract the truth from there. So it sounded like very, you know, high-end math mechanistic, which was very common in the space.
[940.7s] You know, crypto has a lot of these like—and I was in the math department at Berkeley—a lot of these mathematician types who came in and wanted to create really complicated schemes and mechanisms and all that sort of stuff that had provable theoretical properties for something interesting about
[959.9s] you know, the space.
[961.4s] But yeah, so they must have launched it like right away.
[964.5s] That's very interesting.

Andrew Keys:**
[965.6s] I remember us talking to them at some point, and they were developing that.
[970.3s] Like, they did want to be a day-one dApp, I remember.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[973.7s] And they were—I think the first one went live in 2018, the Wikipedia page says—but they did the crowdsale basically right away.
[979.6s] Right, right, right.

UNKNOWN:**
[982.7s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[984.3s] So should we go on to Devcon1, which I guess I can talk about.
[990.5s] So kind of concurrently, while all this is happening, we started to work a bunch.
[995.8s] So ConsenSys had a business development team—
[1000.1s] a little bit of a mix of marketing, BD, actual sales, et cetera—that was starting to generate interest from big companies in the technology.
[1013.2s] So for us ourselves, we definitely worked with companies far more than the crypto public for most of the history of the company.
[1025.5s] Still don't really work with the crypto public today.
[1029.0s] But ConsenSys was kind of conflicted on this front.
[1033.3s] So they had sort of pure blockchain-native projects, and eventually in big numbers.
[1040.5s] They also had an enterprise arm, which was really more consulting-oriented, although they kind of ended up backfilling what they saw demand for with products at times.
[1052.0s] But in any case, the BD folks were reaching out to everybody, and they actually got a fair bit of interest from Microsoft.
[1061.7s] And I think Microsoft had already been kind of watching the Ethereum revolution and seeing it as something interesting—the new front of the cloud war, perhaps.
[1074.6s] And so, you know, we got to working with them, and maybe for the technical part of this I could kind of transition. But basically, ConsenSys had a couple of
[1088.6s] preferred projects, which had the low-level—you know, like low-level, I mean the blockchain client itself—infrastructure that could be deployed on cloud platforms.
[1100.3s] And maybe, you know, so that ended up being basically us and the, you know, the Java folks.
[1109.7s] Vic, do you want to take any?
[1112.0s] I think you were saying before.

Andrew Keys:**
[1113.4s] Yeah, sure.
[1116.5s] So they were interested in being able to deploy one of the clients that we had.
[1124.4s] We had the Haskell client and then the Java folks.
[1127.3s] They were actually more interested in the Java folks.
[1131.1s] Wait, I should take a step back here.
[1133.3s] Just mentioning that Devcon1 almost didn't happen—if you recall, right?
[1139.3s] It was in this low period, and the Ethereum Foundation was kind of running out of money. This is why the launch had to happen when it happened.
[1148.2s] And in that low period, they were still trying to preserve a lot of cash.
[1153.8s] And so it almost didn't happen.
[1156.0s] And I remember a lot of people inside ConsenSys were like, "No, we have to bring this—
[1162.8s] to bring this up and make an event out of this."
[1166.6s] I think Andrew Keys was leading the charge on that, really saying, "We got to do this."
[1171.3s] And then this Microsoft thing bundled into that.
[1176.2s] It was us and the Java client.
[1180.0s] And my background was like, you know, in my previous company, I had tried to work with Microsoft in building apps, like when they had their first mobile platform.
[1189.7s] And it took me like six months to get a meeting.
[1192.4s] And I had a cousin who was like a VP at Microsoft.
[1194.8s] So it—
[1195.2s] so it was amazing to me that they were just coming to us and they wanted to launch something with us in two months.
[1201.6s] And I think at that point, we decided, okay, this is a huge opportunity.
[1206.7s] We're going to drop everything and focus on that launch, which turned out to be the launch of Blockchain as a Service.
[1213.5s] But oddly enough, the Java guys started and then they just kind of faded away.
[1218.1s] Like they weren't really interested in pursuing it.
[1223.1s] They just had other things going on.
[1225.1s] So we, like, went over it.
[1227.2s] So by the time Devcon1 happened, the only thing that was working was, you know, our client—it was ready on the cloud.
[1235.2s] You could download it and you could start building on it right away.
[1238.4s] And I remember we started to get downloads immediately.
[1242.1s] People started to get people using it immediately.
[1245.6s] But that’s also—in that run-up—that was when we realized, when Microsoft realized, if we're going to make this as a developer tool, it can't connect to the public Ethereum network because
[1261.8s] people wouldn't be able to get Ether.
[1264.1s] Like it was quite hard to get Ether at that point.
[1266.7s] There weren't really that many exchanges or anything to go on.
[1270.0s] So that's kind of how we created private Ethereum, you know—what became known as private Ethereum or Enterprise Ethereum.
[1281.6s] So—
[1282.1s] that kind of all led up.
[1283.5s] And then the launch itself in London, when we got up with Microsoft—I think people were shocked that Microsoft was into it.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1293.2s] You know, so I just looked that up—it didn’t have in our little outline—but I had forgotten about this.
[1299.3s] So I think Coinbase listed Ether like mid-2016, right?
[1304.0s] I'm seeing May 24, 2016.
[1307.4s] So—and I guess like Kraken was the popular exchange at the time, you know.

Andrew Keys:**
[1312.6s] I think it was Poloniex.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1314.5s] I'm sorry, you're right.
[1316.9s] Poloniex still exists.

Andrew Keys:**
[1319.4s] And I just remember there was like the chat function on Poloniex and like—man—that was like crazy.
[1325.4s] Like that was Discord before there was Discord.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1328.4s] Oh wait, hold on.
[1329.9s] Circle bought it maybe, and then it seems to have shut it down.
[1334.5s] Anyway, I'm confused by all this.
[1336.1s] But yeah, so it was sketchy for sure.
[1339.4s] It was like a whale chat box.
[1341.7s] I never really used it, but I would see it on people's computers and all that sort of thing.
[1346.8s] It was difficult to get in and out of Ether for a while.
[1351.8s] Jim, were you going to say something?

Jim (SPEAKER_01):**
[1353.4s] I'm just kind of remembering back then—remind me—because I'm sort of like, not sure if I've got this right, but I think maybe you're downplaying the Java thing a little bit. I think if I remember right,
[1365.3s] Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time.
[1367.5s] Am I misremembering that?

Andrew Keys:**
[1369.2s] No, you're not.
[1371.2s] Well, the thing is, they really wanted something that they could pitch to companies.
[1377.4s] And you know, like—companies use Java, right?
[1382.5s] So they were like, really...
[1384.7s] And, um—
[1386.4s] So like when we kind of like—were like—we just dropped everything and just focused on that—
[1393.1s] and I remember like, we sort of had this internal mantra: "We got to get on stage and be able to write a dApp in, like, 30 seconds."
[1401.3s] Like, that was our internal mantra.

Jim:**
[1402.9s] They had like, pre-announced something or something.
[1405.0s] And then the Java guys sort of disappeared or something.

Andrew Keys:**
[1408.5s] Yeah.
[1408.6s] They pre-announced that they were going to show like the Java client and the Haskell client.
[1413.9s] And we were like this—we were like the runner-up.
[1417.0s] Like, I think they kind of accepted us because we were willing to work really hard.
[1424.3s] And the Java guys—I think they knew that they needed a backup.

Jim:**
[1429.7s] The other thing I remember about Microsoft is that there was a little bit of like, um, tension within there, because they were just launching Azure at that time.
[1440.2s] And at the same time they had blockchain people, and the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it.
[1445.5s] And the Azure people wanted to use this as a way to promote the new platform.
[1450.4s] So there was always a little bit of friction within.

Andrew Keys:**
[1455.3s] Yeah, I mean like, I remember, I think Marley Gray was really driving those efforts inside Microsoft at the time. And they were really, really pushing it.
[1467.4s] And I remember they were trying to get people in the room to talk to us, and some of them weren’t even—
[1474.5s] I mean, it was probably like you said, they were launching Azure.
[1477.9s] So that's a huge project.
[1479.2s] I'm sure they were just busy with other stuff.
[1481.0s] But we spent a lot of time in their New York office.
[1483.8s] I remember we were going there all the time.

[1751.8s] I remember the project Slock.it was sort of being marketed at DevCon1, but I believe it's a lot of the same people as The DAO.
[1760.7s] And do you remember, like, I think they presented, but I can't, I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.

Victor:**
[1765.5s] So Slock.it was this sort of IoT kind of strange thing where you could unlock a lock, but it was structured around
[1775.2s] what actually became The DAO.
[1777.5s] Like they—I think they invented the concept—not the concept, but I think they practically created a DAO in order to own this lock.
[1786.2s] And then they realized, well, you know, I think they realized, "Well, we don't actually need the lock."
[1792.1s] Like, The DAO is the most important thing.
[1794.2s] And the lock, the actual lock thing, is not that interesting.
[1797.6s] So yeah, it was 100% the same people.
[1801.2s] Like they were introducing both ideas at the same time.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[1804.6s] So let me transition into The DAO part.
[1807.3s] I'm going to go slightly out of order here.
[1810.1s] So, Victor, what was The DAO?

Victor:**
[1814.2s] So The DAO was basically—it was kind of like an investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain, right?
[1822.8s] So basically, people would put money into this contract, and this contract would basically fund—
[1836.9s] the goal of it was that it would fund different projects.
[1841.8s] But it started to consume a huge amount of money—
[1844.0s] you know, the overall Ether supply.
[1844.0s] I think it was as high as like 20 or 25 percent of the entire Ether supply that got locked up into this contract.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[1850.6s] Yeah, I'm looking on the Wikipedia right now.
[1852.9s] So part of the reason I thought of it in this sequence is by looking at the price action.
[1858.3s] Part of it is that the extant Ether supply went down because—okay,
[1863.2s] so as of May 2016, The DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all Ether tokens issued to date.
[1872.9s] So they ran a crowdsale, and the crowdsale raised $34 million—
[1879.6s] $34 million by May 10, 2016.
[1884.4s] More than $50 million by May 12, over $100 million by May 15.
[1889.3s] So sometimes the dynamics of these ICOs—this is one thing that’s kind of crazy—but one thing that blockchains seem to do that's really difficult to do with other technologies
[1907.7s] is to have this sort of really large-scale collaboration.
[1910.7s] And in this case, to pool capital, basically.
[1917.4s] So I suppose there was some sort of virality going on—
[1924.8s] people were talking about The DAO, and you just see this enormous movement of funds sort of overnight.

[1927.7s] They end up holding by May 21, 2016, over $150 million in Ether from over 10,000 people,
[1948.9s] which is about, it says according to the article, about 14% of all Ether tokens issued at that time.
[1952.1s] So it was really fast, right?
[1954.3s] It took everybody by surprise.
[1954.3s] I remember, I think I had a meeting that the enterprise folks at ConsenSys had set up with—I'm going to say the people at BBVA.
[1967.5s] I'm forgetting last names, but I think it was like Scarlett and Carlos.
[1968.9s] I don't think you went to this one, Vic.
[1971.8s] I think you were at Ed's now.
[1974.8s] They were just like—it just caught everyone’s attention.
[1981.3s] It was crazy, you know. And they were talking a bit about operational use cases for the bank,
[1994.2s] but then it was also like—there was a sense that like this is where the future is. Like, the money just moved, you know?
[1994.2s] There were none of those heavy subscription agreements, and, you know, all that sort of thing.
[2001.8s] And, you know, it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years.
[2015.4s] Yeah.
[2016.7s] Do you remember anything about that, beyond, you know, "It was crazy"?

Victor:**
[2021.4s] So there were—so you had all the supply locked into this contract.
[2025.8s] And I think the hack was like—yeah. So there was this massive race between—there was a flaw in the contract logic, and because it's immutable,
[2037.2s] the smart contract couldn’t be changed.
[2038.4s] When people realized, there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract
[2050.0s] and the people who actually worked on The DAO itself.
[2052.7s] But the people who were successful at extracting the money pulled out a lot of it.
[2057.6s] I don't remember the number, but I think it was a huge amount of the value—they were able to pull that out.
[2067.1s] The ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account.
[2072.9s] And everyone knew where it went—because everything on the blockchain is completely transparent—
[2078.1s] but no one could do anything about it.
[2080.2s] They couldn't take the money out.
[2082.0s] And so the money was just sitting there, basically.
[2086.2s] It was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something.
[2090.3s] And no one knew what to do about this situation.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[2093.9s] Yeah, yeah.
[2096.8s] And so, okay.
[2101.5s] I'm kind of looking back on it.
[2104.1s] So it was—yeah, it blew up, and it also caused the creation—
[2109.8s] so I remember there was, at this time—and we had to implement this in our software—a hard fork debate.
[2119.8s] Because—so it’s pretty early,
[2123.8s] it’s like less than a year after Ethereum launched.
[2129.5s] Probably a lot of the big Ether holders participated in this.
[2133.5s] They’d lost significant funds—maybe all of their funds.
[2133.5s] And the question was: do you make people whole, or do you stick true to the absolute immutability in the classic blockchain sense?
[2151.1s] Where it’s totally buyer beware—you shouldn't have put your Ether in this contract if you weren’t prepared to lose it.
[2163.2s] And the refund group won. So in a sense—I mean, both Ethereum, Bitcoin—really all the projects—are governed, to an extent,
[2176.4s] by the people who develop the software and,
[2179.6s] on an ongoing basis, discuss additions to the protocol, etc.
[2187.1s] And even in the early days of Bitcoin—I was not really around for this—but supposedly they had to be extremely creative about keeping the protocol running
[2202.3s] while not ever reverting any of the history.
[2202.3s] I don’t believe they’ve ever done a hard fork of the nature described here—though there have been, maybe not sponsored by the founders.
[2211.4s] Obviously there are forks of Bitcoin now: Bitcoin Cash, all that sort of thing.
[2216.7s] And so the Ethereum community elected to—or the Foundation or whatever that is—elected to
[2230.4s] sort of forcibly revert the funds.
[2234.3s] There was just like a—almost like a credit as of a certain block number.
[2239.9s] So everyone got their funds back.
[2242.3s] Jim had to code it.
[2243.7s] Maybe I helped a little bit.
[2245.3s] No, I was not coding anymore at this point.
[2247.6s] And so Ethereum Classic was like the hardliners:**
[2253.5s] "We’re sticking to immutability."
[2256.1s] Sorry, Jim, are you going to say something?

[2258.6s] Oh no—Victor, you were gonna say something.

Victor:**
[2260.9s] No, no, no.
[2262.8s] And so Ethereum Classic got some backers—I think maybe famously, I think Barry Silbert was into Ethereum Classic. Maybe still is.
[2273.6s] And eventually it was—I think someday, Victor, you told me this, right?
[2280.9s] Someday later, it had a hard fork itself, right?
[2283.7s] When some issue was discovered with the protocol. Is that correct?

Victor:**
[2286.7s] I think—I don't know if it was a hard fork or a soft fork—but yeah,
[2292.6s] there have been debates inside the Ethereum Classic community too, on how to implement different changes into the protocol, right?
[2304.1s] It’s not just running—like, there’s constantly... I think Bob Summerwill of the Ethereum Classic Collective knows more about this stuff than I do.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[2314.5s] Interesting.
[2315.1s] Yeah, maybe I can follow up on exactly how this went down.
[2318.4s] But I think—also I think Ethereum Classic maybe was mining forever, philosophically, whereas Ethereum switched over to proof of stake like a year ago—a year and a half.
[2332.9s] So yeah, there were more kind of... although there was—okay, yeah, I just Googled it.
[2338.2s] Here's a June 28 Cointelegraph article that says “Ethereum Classic devs announce upcoming hard fork,” yada yada.
[2344.2s] So they at least subsequently did some amount of hard forking, but, you know—interesting nonetheless.
[2353.1s] Funny thing also when this hard fork happens, right?
[2356.4s] It's—you know, you don’t—this is a silly comment from someone who's, you know, fairly compliance-focused, right?
[2364.1s] Like, what’s the tax treatment of a hard fork??
[2366.9s] Like, you had some—say you had some tokens on one chain, and then they morph and now you have tokens on both chains.
[2373.2s] I think it’s like airdrops too—or like ordinary income,
[2377.2s] which means whether or not you wanted those hard fork coins, you probably have to pay taxes on them if you can access and liquidate them.
[2387.6s] But you have to pay them whether or not you liquidate.
[2390.1s] It's not just capital gains.
[2392.3s] So, quite a strange test of our system that we’ve seen with blockchain,
[2399.8s] because they fork all the time.
[2399.8s] There’s lots of airdrops, etc.
[2401.5s] And you might not even be aware.
[2403.8s] Um, all right.
[2405.7s] So that was The DAO.
[2408.0s] I want to...
[2413.1s] Yeah, this was crazy.
[2416.1s] Like, I still kind of can’t believe this happened.
[2419.4s] And it's happened way bigger and differently later.
[2419.4s] But, you know, it’s—yeah, it was quite a moment—all of this.

Victor:**
[2428.3s] Well, I looked up the current price, and in current dollars,
[2431.9s] it would be roughly the equivalent of $30 billion, if you think about it.
[2439.2s] So yeah, it would be huge.
[2441.7s] Because I think we were so small at the time, right?

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[2445.2s] Yeah.
[2446.3s] Okay, I want to take you to the second CoinDesk Consensus hackathon.
[2453.5s] And again, hand it to Victor for everything you recall.
[2458.2s] Also, we have some pictures from that time.
[2459.9s] We could just show some of that on screen.

Victor:**
[2462.1s] Yeah, I found it from CoinDesk.
[2464.7s] Let me see if I can still find them.
[2467.2s] So what I remember of it is that it was—
[2470.5s] I think it was one of the first CoinDesk Consensus events, which, you know, subsequently became huge.
[2478.5s] And then—so they kind of had two events around it.
[2484.9s] One was a hackathon, which we were part of.
[2487.7s] And then the event itself, which was—I think at the Ritz. Like, both events were in Times Square.
[2505.2s] The hackathon came first at Microsoft in Times Square,
[2505.2s] and then the event was kind of, you know, a couple blocks away in the hotel.
[2512.2s] And I remember that, like, during the hackathon itself,
[2517.9s] we were all in these different conference rooms.
[2521.5s] There was early Hyperledger and some other—I can't remember who the other clients were—but there were competing clients not Ethereum-based.
[2534.5s] There was a pretty good turnout.
[2536.0s] I think like over a hundred people showed up—a lot of people kind of showed up.
[2540.2s] And our room got so crowded, we had to co-opt another boardroom in order to build.
[2548.4s] So I think we got a significant majority of the developers building stuff on our platform, which was super exciting.
[2557.8s] I remember walking by
[2560.4s] the rooms that Hyperledger had—or I’m trying to remember what the other client was—and there weren’t very many people in there.
[2570.2s] It seemed like the people that were in there were people who were working for them.
[2574.5s] So that was really, really exciting.
[2576.3s] Though, in the end, we didn’t win.
[2579.8s] At least, someone building on our stack didn’t win because I think the winner was actually something that had been built way before that hackathon existed—
[2586.9s] which was, you know, technically against the rules, but we didn’t hold anyone to that.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_02):**
[2597.0s] This is—Victor asserts—if we lost, it’s because someone else cheated.
[2601.5s] Exactly.
[2604.5s] That’s how we feel.

Victor:**
[2606.5s] That’s at least how I felt at the time, whether or not that’s completely true.
[2611.4s] Memory is subjective.
[2614.6s] That’s all I’m saying.

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[2620.6s] And the rest of the conference?

Victor:**
[2624.6s] Oh, and then the rest of the conference—
[2628.1s] that I think was like the first shiny big blockchain conference, right?
[2633.6s] I remember Vitalik speaking. They launched—I think—the first Hyperledger app there, and a bunch of—
[2643.8s] there was a bunch of activity.
[2643.8s] It was a really interesting combination because most of the other conferences like DevCon are really developer-focused.
[2654.8s] But this—you could really see a lot of businesses becoming interested.
[2665.9s] The thing I most remember about that conference is that we were pulled into a room at one point.
[2665.9s] In the room was the head of Hyperledger, John Wolpert, and Vitalik.
[2675.6s] And they were like, “Hey, we heard that you guys have an enterprise-ready version of Ethereum
[2681.5s] that can switch between the public net and private blockchains,” right?
[2687.3s] And I remember Wolpert at the time was like, “My engineers claim that this is completely impossible.”
[2695.1s] And Jim—I think—you pulled out your laptop and said, “Here it is.”
[2699.3s] Showed him—you know, “This is how it works.”
[2701.9s] And you could start building on it and everything.
[2704.4s] And there was this conversation going back and forth between Wolpert and Vitalik about—
[2713.8s] I think—Hyperledger supporting Ethereum.
[2716.4s] And it kind of ended—what I remember of it—it ended with
[2721.0s] I think Vitalik was—you know, he always wears an Ethereum t-shirt, right?
[2726.2s] And Wolpert is about three sizes larger than Vitalik, but...

Unknown Speaker (SPEAKER_03):**
[2731.4s] Interesting. I think Vitalik is very tall, and John is stockier.
[2736.1s] If they’re at a bench press competition, I expect there would be a pretty big differentiation, you know, in
[2744.5s] what John could bench and what Vitalik could bench.

Victor:**
[2748.8s] Yeah, I think you’re right.

[2750.6s] Like, it's not—we're not saying that John is unfit.
[2753.9s] He's just much larger, and Vitalik is still quite skinny, right?
[2759.4s] So John was like three sizes bigger.
[2762.2s] And I think it was Andrew Keys who pointed to the t-shirt and said, "Vitalik, take that shirt off and give it to John," because he was about to walk on stage.
[2772.3s] And it was like a muscle shirt on him.
[2776.0s] It was so tight.
[2778.8s] It looked like a compression shirt.
[2780.2s] And he went on stage.
[2781.1s] People were kind of shocked—like, hey, what's going on?
[2785.0s] This is the head of Hyperledger, and now he's wearing an Ethereum t-shirt?
[2788.7s] And it's interesting, because eventually, that led to Hyperledger actually supporting Ethereum-type clients like Besu.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2797.9s] Yeah, I would add—talking to John occasionally over the years—he actually went on to join ConsenSys later. I don’t really know what he’s up to today.
[2807.9s] I don’t think he’s there anymore.
[2810.7s] But he had sort of a sense of not wanting to be on the wrong side of history.
[2818.1s] He was always talking about IBM’s embrace of Linux—instead of pushing really hard with its own operating system, they just invested tons into open source development on Linux.
[2830.1s] So they were able to have something to run on their mainframes, which is still a big business for them today.
[2840.9s] And so he was always debating back and forth: should we do our own thing?
[2847.5s] It was at least mostly open source.
[2850.0s] Should we go the Ethereum way?
[2853.2s] What do we do?
[2854.4s] And I think this was perhaps the best illustration of that conflict.
[2861.3s] IBM was formidable for a while—sort of scary as a competitor and all that.
[2869.5s] And I don’t hear that much blockchain noise out of them anymore.
[2873.2s] I think they’ve shifted resources and so on.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2877.3s] By the way, I did find the picture from that first hackathon.
[2881.3s] This is off CoinDesk, but here’s the picture at the mic.
[2888.7s] This was one of the rooms, and we had to co-op another room.
[2892.8s] This was very early in the process.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2895.4s] Yeah, yeah.
[2896.5s] I remember this one.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2898.0s] And here I am sitting in the middle over here.
[2901.2s] But yes.
[2905.0s] But yeah, it grew really, really rapidly.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2910.5s] All righty, I’m close to rounding up here, but I’ve got a couple more things.
[2918.6s] So, things are moving along.
[2920.5s] 2016—there’s some kind of organic momentum.
[2923.3s] I know we hired a lot of people during this period.
[2926.6s] Our software was being used in enterprise projects.
[2932.6s] We were ramping up headcounts because people were using our software more.
[2937.8s] I was looking at this and thinking, I can't believe the timeframes were this tight.
[2946.4s] So Devcon 2 was in September 2016.
[2950.0s] And yes, it was in Shanghai, right?
[2952.7s] I remember dealing with all the visa stuff.
[2958.8s] Thankfully, ConsenSys dealt with that.
[2961.6s] We were doing a capital raise—kind of our first seed-ish one at the time.
[2967.1s] But it felt like a coming-out party.
[2972.3s] I don’t know. What do you all recall?
[2977.7s] What are your impressions from Devcon 2, et cetera?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2985.7s] There was some big attack on Ethereum.
[2988.0s] I’m trying to remember the details, but I remember waking up and suddenly I was completely involved in digging into the Haskell client, figuring out what was going on and what changes we had to make.
[3007.0s] So...

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3008.3s] I do remember—there were transactions being created that slowed the clients down, right?
[3020.6s] I think it was due to the way the data structures were set up—it was just hard to process them quickly.
[3027.4s] I can’t recall all of it. But yeah, it was funny.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3035.0s] The funny thing I sort of remember is—maybe you’re about to bring this up—but the EEA was formed during that conference.
[3042.6s] Victor somehow grabbed me in the morning and said, “I’ve got all these meetings, and I’d like you to come along too.”
[3051.8s] But I had my laptop and was trying to dig into the tech with all the stuff going on.
[3056.5s] So I sat in the corner at a coffee shop coding all day.
[3062.0s] And then at the end of the day, I asked, “What were all those meetings you had?”
[3064.8s] And Victor said, “Oh yeah, we just formed the EEA.”

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3069.5s] Yeah, it was funny.
[3071.4s] Really, it was Jeremy Miller—who I think later became Chief of Staff at ConsenSys—who kind of drove that.
[3078.4s] There had been a previous attempt, I think by Matt Spoke, to create a group of enterprises to work together on standards.
[3090.4s] And that never really went anywhere.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3092.5s] I have no memory of this.
[3095.5s] So could you—
[3099.2s] Matt was at Deloitte?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3104.5s] Yes, Matt was at Deloitte at the time.
[3106.5s] Deloitte was early into blockchain.
[3108.6s] They were at Devcon 1.
[3110.1s] They were really early into blockchain and had started building out a practice—ironically in the Toronto office.
[3116.0s] They were quite focused and knowledgeable.
[3121.4s] At some point, they started a sort of consortium of companies wanting to use Ethereum.
[3131.1s] Then there was us—we were working with Microsoft—and that was happening kind of organically.
[3137.8s] But we realized there was a need for companies to collaborate on this kind of stuff.
[3146.6s] Jeremy Miller just thought, “What’s happening now isn’t working. We need some proper structure.”
[3155.1s] I think there had just been an announcement on the Ethereum Foundation site, but no one was really driving it.
[3161.0s] So during that day, we kind of aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop—
[3167.3s] like literally right beside you.
[3170.8s] Jeremy, John Whelan from Santander, Matt Spoke came in, I think Marleah came at one point, and James Slazas too.
[3188.9s] We were all saying, “Okay, we need this organization. We need to get this together.”
[3197.5s] It all happened at that Starbucks just outside the conference center.
[3198.2s]
[3200.2s] It really came together.
[3202.3s] It was amazing—by the end of the day, we said, "Yes, we’re going to form this group," which eventually became the EEA.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3210.0s] I’ll add some peripheral details.
[3212.2s] So we get to Shanghai, right?
[3215.3s] You get this wave of jet lag.
[3217.1s] It’s a hefty flight.
[3219.4s] You get this card.
[3221.6s] And the card says something like "Aliens not going to hotels"—aliens being people who aren’t Chinese—must report to the police within 72 hours or something.
[3238.2s] And I was like,
[3240.7s] “Does this mean hotels are part of the police system?”
[3245.0s] I don’t know.
[3246.6s] Plenty of listeners probably haven’t been to mainland China.
[3251.9s] Then you get to the hotel.
[3254.9s] It’s like an hour drive from the airport.
[3262.0s] Shanghai is vast—
[3264.1s] there are high-rises along the highway all the way in, and they just get denser as you get close.
[3272.3s] What was the name of the neighborhood? Wasn’t it the old stock exchange building that had been converted to a hotel?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3279.2s] Yeah, we were right downtown.
[3281.4s] I’m trying to remember the hotel’s name.
[3284.0s] The conference was right downtown, close to the Bund.
[3288.0s] That’s the area by the river.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3291.3s] Right—the side with the old European architecture—and the other side is like brand new.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3296.6s] Yeah, that’s Pudong—it was originally the suburbs.
[3302.2s] I had founded two companies in China, so I was the “China expert,” taking people around.
[3310.8s] If you’re not staying at a hotel, the government wants to be able to contact you.
[3318.6s] If you stay in a hotel, they take care of the police registration.
[3326.7s]
[3327.9s] We were all in this smaller hotel.
[3332.8s] I remember taking you guys for Chinese breakfast,
[3336.3s] and you really loved it.
[3338.4s] We even went back.
[3339.6s] I was like—there are better places!

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3341.0s] It was really good.
[3341.8s] I think we went to a couple of holes-in-the-wall too.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3344.6s] Exactly.
[3345.5s] Exactly.
[3346.8s] This one was a hole-in-the-wall.
[3348.6s] I was trying to give you the experience.
[3350.7s] You guys liked it, so we kept going.

[3353.1s] Another thing I remember from that conference—the Wall Street Journal was covering it, and I got quoted saying, “I think China is going to be one of the biggest blockchain markets in the world.”
[3368.1s] This was before they started their own digital currency and really doubled down on building their own blockchain.
[3374.3s] People thought I was bonkers for saying that—at the time, China hadn’t done anything.
[3382.9s] It was so early in the journey.
[3386.0s] But as you said, all of this happened really fast.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3388.9s] Yeah.
[3390.2s] Also, we announced a project we were working on—it was nearing completion—with BHP Billiton.
[3399.1s] It was a big-time project, kind of the beginning of our supply chain work.
[3405.3s] Our champion at BHP was a guy named Tyler Smith—super smart guy, a geophysicist and blockchain enthusiast.
[3412.8s] The announcement really helped—got people excited about the tech, helped us close financing at the time, etc.

[3422.8s] So we were all on stage.
[3425.2s] Tyler had been to Shanghai before, and
[3432.1s] like people often do in Asia, he was hunting for inexpensive but nice suits.
[3439.2s] He told me his “algorithm.”
[3441.6s] There’s a place nearby called the fabric market, right Vic?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3445.7s] Yeah, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3446.4s] He hung around watching where local Chinese businesspeople were going.
[3450.0s] They all went up to the third floor to a particular tailor.
[3457.2s] He showed us where it was.
[3461.4s] I think you got some suits too, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3463.0s] I did.
[3463.5s] That algorithm worked.
[3464.1s] That’s also my trick for finding good food:**
[3466.7s] I watch where the taxi drivers go.
[3470.4s] That’s how I found that hole-in-the-wall place.
[3480.3s] I lived in Beijing and had been to Shanghai many times, but didn’t know near our hotel where to eat.
[3483.5s] So I watched where taxis stopped. Chances are the food’s good there.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3487.7s] Yeah—and he told me the last time he was in China he went like 10 hours by bus, train, and boat to get the best silk blankets, apparently somewhere near Shanghai.
[3501.8s] I never found out where, so I couldn't follow up.

[3505.4s] But same deal—local knowledge gets you far.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3511.9s] Nowadays it’s all high-speed rail.
[3513.6s] I remember traveling through China with like 18-hour train rides—brutal.
[3528.4s] Sometimes I had to stand the whole time in a packed train.
[3530.5s] But now it’s high-speed rail.
[3532.3s] It’s amazing.
[3532.4s] In many cases, it’s faster than flying.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3536.2s] Yeah.
[3538.4s] In any case, it was quite an experience.
[3540.4s] We did some business development—lots of meetings with potential customers and investors.
[3552.1s] Doing business in China is tough, for any listeners considering it.
[3557.0s] I wouldn’t recommend it unless you really know what you’re doing.
[3562.0s] But it was a trip.

[3564.5s] I had to leave early for events I was doing—with Intel, I think?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3570.5s] Yeah, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3571.6s] But it was wild.
[3577.1s] For a tech project, Ethereum was kind of Europe-centric...
[3584.7s] But I think Asia showed even greater uptake.
[3589.2s] It made it feel really global.
[3592.4s] It was kind of funny to see all this happening.
[3606.0s] The Internet kind of works there—it was cool to hang out in Shanghai. Totally different planet, it felt like.

[3612.9s] All right, I think that’s a wrap—leading up to the EEA launch.
[3620.8s] The idea was hatched in a Starbucks in Shanghai.

[3626.6s] And basically, kind of the quote—I guess Jeremy was fond of saying—is that, like, every innovation lab is using Ethereum now. They're watching us and they're each hacking it their own way to be something they can actually use, right?

[3640.1s] So no one wanted to connect to the public net at that time.

[3644.7s] It's definitely changed some over the years, especially with the NFT revolution, et cetera.

[3652.5s] And so there was not a lot of technological reuse going on in the duct tape that various enterprises were putting on the software to make it work

[3667.4s] for their needs.

[3670.3s] Probably most notable in that set of enterprises was JP Morgan, which we can talk about in more detail.

[3681.0s] But a lot of them were doing it.

[3682.3s] The folks at the Innovation Lab at Santander, who we know pretty well, were doing their own thing.

[3691.3s] It was quite interesting to observe

[3695.3s] the goings-on. And Vic, do you remember—OK, so there were like a couple face-to-face meetings that were very hush-hush. I think Microsoft hosted some of them around the launch of the EEA.

[3708.2s] So you’ve kind of napkinned out the idea in Starbucks, but then what was the next thing that happened?

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[3714.9s] So then there were a bunch—there were a series of meetings

[3718.8s] that were really about structuring. So like, how did we want to structure this organization? And, you know, what should the composition be like—should it be all big companies? Should it be, you know, like how much of the tech should be involved? How much of the company side should be involved?

[3738.2s] And how it should work, like, you know, should it be a free organization? Should we charge membership? Should—you know, all of that was on the table. But the amazing thing about those meetings is they did start small, but they eventually wound up to be

[3756.8s] like 40 people in the room. Like all the major clients, you know, all of these things.

[3762.6s] Because I think at the time, really where the interest was in terms of real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain was in the enterprise space.

[3772.7s] Like they were willing to make investments into that.

[3775.3s] So like everyone was kind of participating in that.

[3778.1s] And so there were these really, really active discussions.

[3781.8s] And ultimately, we just kind of had to set a line in the sand and make a launch, basically.

[3789.5s] And that kind of led to it launching in early 2017.

[3794.5s] But, you know, in terms of timeframe, you’ve got to think that it was only a little over a year when we launched with a single big company.

[3802.6s] And then at the launch of the EEA, it was like 40 companies that were—yeah, I remember 28 or something like that.

Jim McDonald:**
[3808.7s] There was a logo wall that was nice—they showed it.

[3811.8s] You know, it was really substantial.

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[3814.2s] And it was in the Brooklyn JPM office.

[3816.5s] And, you know, it was a lot of big players.

[3820.1s] And this really kind of told the world, like, hey, this is serious—this is something that should happen.

[3825.4s] So, you know, it was really, really exciting.

[3828.3s] But yeah, the negotiations around it were really complicated.

[3832.2s] And in some cases, needed.

[3833.8s] I remember one of the biggest negotiations was between the different clients, right?

[3839.2s] Like there was us, and then there were other clients who were trying to figure out how do we share information among us?

Jim McDonald:**
[3847.1s] Yeah.

[3848.1s] I’d also add—OK, so JP Morgan—when did they announce Quorum?

[3854.4s] That’s a good question.

[3856.8s] I think it was probably before the EEA launch, but I'm not sure.

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[3861.3s] Yeah, I know they had a blockchain team that ironically also was working in Haskell.

[3868.4s] And, you know, eventually we wound up doing work on Quorum too.

[3872.8s] So there was—like, we had been talking to them for a while.

[3876.2s] But I can’t remember when the official launch of Quorum was.

Jim McDonald:**
[3881.0s] I have some memory that they demoed something at—

[3886.4s] and ConsenSys might have helped with like the front end of the demo—I can’t quite recall. But I believe that they demoed something at the launch, which was, what, like February or March 2017? Something like that?

[3902.8s] Yeah.

[3903.1s] So I think they must have announced it by then. So Quorum was

[3908.5s] a flavor of Ethereum—or a flavor of Enterprise Ethereum—where they’d taken the Go Ethereum client and done things like add privacy, so that it was easier to obscure data.

[3921.0s] And there was a messaging layer it had, et cetera.

[3924.4s] And similar things we developed over the years just in response to the privacy preferences and needs of big enterprises, basically.

[3934.2s] So they all wanted to use the technology.

[3936.7s] But they didn't want a native token.

[3938.4s] They didn’t want too much detail leaking to potential competitors or even trading counterparties, et cetera.

[3951.0s] So a lot of people developed similar features at the same time to service the enterprise need.

[3964.2s] But yeah, so the event—

[3968.0s] Thirty big enterprises—or 30 companies—a few startups, a lot of big enterprises.

[3973.7s] I think the membership of the EEA peaked at like 500 companies, or something really large, right?

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[3980.6s] It was in the hundreds.

[3981.6s] I don’t remember.

Jim McDonald:**
[3983.0s] Three hundred or something like that.

[3984.3s] So on the back of this announcement, the business side got pretty excited.

[3991.7s] And later in that year, there were also crypto run-ups—kind of everyone wanted to be

[3998.0s] involved.

[3998.7s] But I think of the EEA launch as sort of the end of the beginning.

[4003.3s] If you look back at the price trend also—oh, I'm bringing it back up.

[4008.9s] I closed it.

[4016.4s] So let’s say it’s February here.

[4018.6s] It does start to really tick up and hit into kind of a fever pitch—2017, 2018, right?

[4027.6s] You know, it’s already at this time around $10. But it really goes dramatically up, and then, you know, kind of the next phase is the

[4037.5s] heyday of the ICO era, which we probably won't talk about today.

[4043.2s] But in my mind, that was when it was a new but established platform and technology—Ethereum—kind of generally acknowledged, by not just some of the public but big businesses as well.

[4060.1s] And had sort of transitioned.

[4062.4s] It was almost in the position of incumbent at that point.

[4066.3s] Now, I also—I don’t quite recall—like, what, you know—maybe if I flip this to market cap, like when did Ethereum

[4077.1s] move up the ranks?

[4081.7s] You know, it’d be good to know the—like, what were the big ranks?

[4084.4s] Crypto coins, or however you want to call them.

[4087.3s] Like, for a while Litecoin was number two, right?

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[4088.3s] I think Ripple was up there.

Jim McDonald:**
[4089.7s] XRP was usually three or something.

[4092.1s] And I don’t even know where Litecoin is today, but I’d have to check when the actual crossover happened.

[4101.3s] Ethereum would be solidly number two for a long time, but maybe we shouldn’t, you know—maybe I’ll—can I figure that out right now?

[4112.2s] I forget how to overlay the prices on CoinMarketCap—or the market caps, rather.

[4116.6s] So we’ve never seen the flip just yet, but it got close at different times in this journey.

[4126.9s] Anyway, I think we could probably leave it there—slightly shorter than the last episode, it appears.

[4135.5s] But I don't know, any final words, Vic, Jim, from this interesting time period in many people's lives—our lives?

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[4146.7s] I think it was just like, looking back, it seems that

[4154.9s] you know, if you look back on successful projects, there’s sort of that survivorship bias—like all the elements were just there.

[4163.0s] And you can see a lot of the elements there, but I don’t think in any way that success was predetermined.

[4171.7s] Like, I think there was a lot—

Jim McDonald:**
[4172.7s] A lot of coordinated effort, right?

[4175.0s] A lot of work, and hard on it together.

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[4177.2s] Yeah.

Jim McDonald:**
[4178.1s] Getting the pieces to make it happen, so to speak.

Unidentified Speaker:**
[4181.5s] I mean, it’s dangerous to look back in time and say, like, I knew that was going to happen.

[4185.7s] But I will say that even before the launch, I remember feeling that I’d never seen such a large group of people so excited about a particular project as that one.

[4196.3s] So, yeah, it felt like it was going to be successful.

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[4204.4s] Yeah. I just mean that—we’ve mentioned a bunch of the people that I think all contributed to the success of the key point. Even though they weren’t, you know, the founders of Ethereum, they made something happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

Jim McDonald:**
[4221.3s] Yeah.

[4222.9s] It’s an interesting thing.

[4223.6s] It’s like—are you being tossed in a great wave, or can you will reality into existence?

[4229.3s] And it’s like—I tend to think of it as a little bit of both.

Unidentified Speaker:**
[4232.5s] Yeah.

[4233.8s] It’s not all hot air from us, because we literally—we did live this technology.

Jim McDonald:**
[4241.8s] So yeah.

[4243.4s] Anyways, all right, let’s close it there.

[4246.9s] Thanks everybody for listening this far, if you made it this far on the second one.

[4253.0s] And yeah, it’d be interesting to, you know—we might continue the series.

[4258.3s] We could also delve in on any particular part of it.

[4261.5s] Maybe we’ll get a guest. Maybe we’ll do something.

[4265.5s] So if anyone wants us to cover anything in particular, please do let us know.

Anthony D'Onofrio:**
[4271.5s] Thanks everyone.

[4272.3s] Have a great day.

[4273.4s] Thank you.
