• Premium models STILL maintain 93-107% retention
• Proves premium models have NO practical length limit
• Non-premium models completely unsuitable

LLAMA DEGRADATION CONFIRMED:
• Continues degrading: 73-77% at 75min → 62-66% at 82min
• Clear linear degradation pattern with length
• Completely unsuitable for production at this duration
• Only premium models viable for 80+ minute content

CONTENT PRESERVATION:
✓ Excellent (93-107%): Opus, Gemini, Sonnet (length-independent!)
⚠ Poor (62-66%): Llama (loses 34-38% content)
⚠ Severe (45-49%): Qwen (loses 51-55% content)

★ From 16 min to 113 min (episode001), premium models maintain 87-107% retention
★ NO degradation observed regardless of duration
★ Opus, Gemini, Sonnet suitable for ANY podcast length
★ This is the defining characteristic of premium processors

NON-PREMIUM MODEL FAILURE PATTERNS:
• ChatGPT: Fails at ALL lengths >40 min (loses 65-87% content)
• Llama: Excellent <60 min, degrades 60-70 min, fails >70 min
• Qwen: Fails at ALL lengths >40 min (loses 45-60% content)
• Qwen-Cloud: Expansion issues at all lengths

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PRODUCTION USE:
├─ PRIMARY: whisperx-cloud + opus (9.3/10)
│           95% retention, premium quality, no length limit
│
└─ BACKUP:  whisperx + gemini (9.2/10)
            102% retention, excellent quality, no length limit

FOR 80+ MIN EPISODES:
• Use EXCLUSIVELY premium models (Opus/Gemini/Sonnet)
• DO NOT use Llama (loses 34-38% of content)
• DO NOT use Qwen (loses 51-55% of content)
• NEVER use ChatGPT (loses 85-87% of content)

choice for podcast transcription at ANY length. All others fail predictably
based on duration, with catastrophic content loss on longer episodes.
