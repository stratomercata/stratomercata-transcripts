**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** So we're using StreamYard too. We're using StreamYard and I'm just double checking.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit... Not all perfect, yeah. Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one looks pretty cool. Pretty great.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to track you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. That's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like, I can go, I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know, But at least I can go in and say, what did you do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I find it quite, quite well. 501.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** We are live. So we are live. No, no, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good call-in show, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for Jane Jo Live in real life.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** In the same room. In the same room. Amazing.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** And you are a special guest. Do you want to show?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslen. Yes. Meslen, who is the executive director of the EA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years. Healthy run.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah. It's eight years now. Since 2017, yeah. February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** There were meetings I was part of in December and January. Those were the first big meetings with whatever, 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at DevCon 2, really. It did. Those were the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. They were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Right. So that public launch was February. It was February. But December, there was an internal one, and then J.P. Morgan...

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** was in January 2017 but but yeah like a lot of those initial contacts have happened at DevCon2 yep in October the previous year well in the DevCon2 oh yes yeah so like basically uh basically uh there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too and there were a lot of interested parties and yeah like The group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at like a Starbucks just off site. And that was sort of the idea formation thing about the.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** And then Matt spoke of NewCo held a little bar side event as well, which we have some technical issues.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, okay. Hold on a second. I'm just going to push James to tell everybody to go to YouTube.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** We have a technical issue, everybody.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I will fix that. Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Space is at 5 a.m.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, Matt spoke, held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to, and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that, yeah, so I think the main thing, I'm going to try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** If not, I am.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I did choose a...

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff. That's right. So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. so that was a not quite the same group it was a larger group that's slightly different uh nuka was part of that luca was part of that um also um by the way we should introduce ourselves yeah i'm boxing will so i'm head of ecosystem at Stratum Cut.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Chairman James Lubin, CEO of Blockups. Victor Wong. Creators of Stratum Recon.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer of Blockups.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** That's it. Sorry, back. But yeah, Amos as well. Do you remember that? Yeah. Taiwan. Taiwan. We should check in on. I haven't thought of Amos until, in like several years until the moment.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep. But then they, they did like work on like Chinese cryptography and stuff like they've got differing requirements. Right. Um, and the master chain, which was in Russia, that was like a, a, a spare bank thing. Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** because you you have uh you know i was not at the year at that time and so it's very interesting for me to you know what were the hopes and the excitement that you see you know you were part of those early conversations this was created yeah i think companies it's like a pretty it was a pretty big event you know yeah as you mentioned you know like gp morgan and everything all those big names coming into the ecosystem And what were the hopes and really like the overall like atmosphere, you know, when the EA was created like eight years ago?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, well, I mean, so, I mean, consensus were very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise like engagement stuff, right? You've got many, many companies like starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot. We want to get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But yeah, you know, over those months, you really have like, they've got a hell of a lot of momentum. Yeah, really, really quick.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** So the observation during DevCon 2 when the idea was hatched was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had, like, hacked their own consensus algorithms and security and... Many guests. Many guests, indeed. We learned later that, like... like a lot of JP Morgan's forum was initially built by Jeff Wilkie.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** He had like some kind of. And that was not announced at the time of DevCon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EA started. But, but yeah, you, you, You've got all of this stuff brewing up, I mean, for years earlier. Like, if you think of, like, ErisDB that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client off POC5 pre-mainnet, mid-2014, of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVF. So, yeah, like, you know, it was all a bit smished apart. But it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Us too. We had our own client and they got used in a bunch of the consensus consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base standard.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I think it was even beyond that. There was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company's silo to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was like bolting on these things. what came out of that those early conversations at devcon was wait like while doing similar things maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster and that was all around private everyone and i guess also like a marriage between like

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** kind of customers of these things and builders yeah of saying you've got all these kind of startup kind of companies that are making ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this but it's there's but yeah on that standardization side there was like nothing and it's like you're all going to get vendor locked like instantly and it'll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible so let's try and work out because well at some point as well with with quorum it was kind of like you know are we going to like collaboratively do code bases as well uh like you know hyperledger was another was another piece into this is that is that a few months earlier i've spent a bunch of time working on c plus plus relicensing c plus plus client to get back to apache 2 so it could have been contributed into hyperledger and we could have gathered around that, that fucked up. So the EA was kind of a backup, I guess, of like, right, we can't have this grand fusion, but there's enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together. And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, okay, we don't want to straight compete with Hyperledger having a shared code base also kind of like screws up the companies.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** So I think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness, I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base, and they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years. And they're just like, not this time. We're not going to live through this.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, also, you have got that market pressure, right, of Corda coming out, of IBM launching Fabric.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** They were worried it would end up that kind of Nominally open source, but quite proprietary.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it's that kind of timeline is like, right, we've got to get our shit together to be able to do like an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** DA at that time, I remember one of our prominent enterprise user EA members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with, you know, 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say. Right. And it's funny that all of the, like, Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention and, like, you know, this competition kind of came in.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening. At that DEVCON event, really were like the first, like the kind of enterprise use cases we talked about today. Like for example, Santander talked about, you know, US dollar on chain, which we all recognize as a stable coin now.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** But you see, Victor, I think that's a very cool parallel. Like you set the stage pretty well for like, you know, where it's coming from. Yeah. And where it started, you mentioned, you know, innovation labs, like starting to contribute to some codes. We've known like the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably like for the last year that things have been really changing drastically. And to take, you know, like your words for when you say innovation labs. it's not innovation lab anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It's really like executive team that say, hey, we want to plan what is the production, like how we get it to market.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Thankfully, like they're scared now.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So like they better move or out. I don't know if it's like, there is, but there was some interesting, some interesting talk, you know, like when we were at Sibos, like the Swift conference.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we should mention that because like, you were just at Sibos and you're dealing with like what we think of as ShredFi institutional players and that's you know where you have a lot of communication so like what were your impressions about where they're at with that because that's the other side that we talk about the digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic everyone is looking because um

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** They know it's happening. They want to be involved. And it's more, and now, especially like there is less, there is less like regulatory, you know. The listeners may not know what Sibos is. Oh, yeah. So Sibos is the big Swift conference. Swift, if you're not familiar, it's a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institutions around the world, it's actually a co-op. It's a DAO for Trash Buy. Okay. Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once. It is a doubt.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Although it's like, can we buy in now? I feel like, you know, it's not. Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** The token is having probably a bank license.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It's like you want to sign up, you got to like buy a bunch of shares and like, you know, then there's an annual fee and whatnot. And you have to like put someone there all the time.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** You have to join the trade guild.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Exactly. And so that big conference is a big make-out of payments, I would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also global financial institutions like clearing house, settlements, like your work leader, etc. But also like all the banks. And they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Saibos and Swift. is a very kind of standard organization. Because what they do is how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format, and recently now they're migrating to something new, which is ISO 222. Okay. Which is, if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time, and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, like they have to be codified.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I think it's good to explain. So, like, most of finance gets cleared through messaging. And it's like, so crypto people are used to like putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** It's not really like this.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, indeed. That's a very key point is that process of what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance. It's a pretty complex thing because how you make sure when you deliver the money, the money has been received, that you receive the asset, that everything has been... And it's a lot of dance because you receive message, you send another one. And it's not like how we used to do where in crypto we submit and it's actually an atomic transaction, which is just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know it's been executed, it's been delivered, and all the parties that it's actually, you know, I give you the can, well, I know you've been giving me, like, the money exactly, you know, where actually there is, like, a little bit dense, well, I put the can here, like, you see the can that has been moving here, like, you send the money, and so the blockchain here offers such a efficiencies because things that were like you know like the t plus one or t plus two for some of some of those different exchange now you you do it like well depending on what chain you're going to deploy yeah between a second to even like less than that yeah and also swift

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** isn't a payments mechanism right no it's not it's a message that's another that's another comment let me i think interject with this specific example i think they're biggest in fx right yes so let's say i've got some usd i want some euro and we kind of like agree to a usd euro trade and so we like i guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and i think it's like i send my side of the trade with some unique id to swift and you do too, and then Swift checks if it matches, it charges $7 either way. If it does match, then it'll tell us that it matched.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way. It's more a swift offer type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It's not much, you know, like the people, like they're going to be some, you know, corresponding banking that's going to be like locally taking your cash and they're going to, everyone is going to take their share.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** It's not moving the asset. It's just, it's like, I have the USD on my bank list. You've got the euro on your bank list.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to each other in a secure and compliant way. Because it's also, oh, he sent that, you have to send some specific messaging for compliance. Then I send another one, say, hey, I checked, there's all the information.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** A bunch of local jurisdiction-specific Yeah, it's like a lot of different handshakes.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I think the way someone described it to me, it's sort of like what they're doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOUs. So like when I send a Swift transaction from like, let's say I send $100 to you in France and I go to my bank, I put in $100. The money doesn't

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** go anywhere they're just oh yeah so the my debate i have to write the usd off the net at the end of the day rtgs that's going to do like the transfer actually exactly that's like a different messaging yeah if you research and i'm not a swift expert but i have to learn that the last couple of months you know i've done like a little bit more like deep dive and it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance you know between you know like two transfer of money Because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money, then you have like the deposit money. So like those, like what you call like M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex. And then we're just talking about payment here, you know, talking about, you know, securities or like those other like financial instruments that you can exchange also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that's, you know, using stablecoin, you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention is like, you know, like we talked about stablecoin and CBDCs.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** They actually exactly the same thing, but just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for a central bank.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** It's just the issuer.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** It's just the issuer is not the same. We're never going to really touch CBDCs because this is like the money of banks, if you say. But almost, I think, from a technical level, it's almost like a copy-paste of the same contract mechanism. But we create a whole different language and terminology for that. But they're actually very similar. And funny fact, Those CBDCs, they've been doing, you know, like the, I think the baby needed to grow, you know, like you said, DEF CON 2. So it was a two years old kid, Ethereum. And we were like, hey, come in here. You can manage like the most critical infrastructure of the planet, which is our money and how we do trade. And you can do all of this. And I think like the Ethereum Foundation, I have to give them credit like they did. Yes, for a long time, they were saying, hey, guys, you're not considering the enterprise and everything. But I think they did the right thing because they protected that baby. So it could grow. And now we're at an age of it's more mature. It's more than 10 years. It's still not even a teenager. The analogy with human is going to take some limits. But we are at a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing, you know, that we're blocking with institutions without, which is, you know, well, scalability, privacy, Composability and interprobability. The four points that you had in the Arc paper from Circle, and now we have this. Just last week, ZKSync announced up to 15,000 TPS, and there is some new thing that almost every week going on. We really like now that the technology, when it looks at, well, I need to make sure like this is private. I need to make sure like this is a, this is going to be like be executed in a seamless way. Also like the decentralization, it's more about the way they look at it. It's more like the vendor locking. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity, but also be resilient enough. This, we still have some work because it's definitely, and I understand the perspective of institution to deploy on a public infrastructure. At first, when Wikipedia showed up 20, 20, 25 years ago, something like that. I think. I mean, I remember I was at my engineering college I was at the board and we were talking about having Wiki, you know, for doing some articles. And they were like, that's very academic guy said, this is, uh, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. Whenever I'm going to do this, this is anyone to put any information. It's not trust to be clear.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** You are friends.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. You're allowed to, you're allowed to. So. But they were in French. They were very like, you know, and protecting this. And at that time, I said, well, we cannot trust, you know, something that's being built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt, but it's actually much more accepted, you know, like that those are like reliable source of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that are actually very resilient.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Sorry, I was just going to ask, like, but, like, there's always this, like, gap between what traditional institutions understand about, like, we all understand what's been capable for a really, really long time. But are there still gaps? Or do you think that's been closed now? Like, it's maybe grown up fully? But, like, but even if, even, like, when the capability is there, there's still, like, A knowledge gap, I think, sometimes.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Well, let me put it this way. There is about, if you combine all the different types of money, $123 trillion of cash around the world.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Right, right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** $300 billion are on chain.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So... The numbers talk for itself. We're very early. So there's people like they can, I think we still have like a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education, I mean really talking from a product perspective. What business problem I can solve for you, how it's going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after, how you're going to deal with very specific use cases. And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding of what you can achieve, but we still need to provide, I think, as an ecosystem more structuring who you can work with, the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what's the type of contract you're going to have after, and really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market. And so some of them, they understand very well, and they have already some pretty detailed questions, even asking me, our red one we need to increase like the contract size from the 24 to uh 40 48 kilobytes and uh we have some you know like those those uh stack overflow issue like well known so yeah the stack tip one that was always a problem and so there is some of them it's this but but then some other ones in in this small product they're going to ask me okay Why should I go on an L2? What is the L1? What does it mean? And what about those changes? What are the primitives? Explaining like, well, if you build on any L2s, you're actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way. But you can completely move your assets freely among all the ecosystem. The wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Mm-hmm.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** And, and so those are seeing, you know, like you, you need to explain some of them, maybe people they're going to say, well, what, what is, what is this? This is just like some, uh, some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers, but most of them, they actually kind of elaborate IOUs. And now we're moving towards more and more having some standards and like, things like it's the legal tent. You want the native issue. The token is the legal claim to the asset. When this happens and when focusing on that, that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things. You connect this with DeFi, you're going to always need some form of AML, KYC and everything. like the, the, the, the defy, like the, like we've known for the last year, it's, They're probably going to have like two of those, but once you connect this, I think that's going to be pretty incredible.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** But how do the institutions feel about like, obviously as the head of the EA and you feel strongly about Ethereum, right? Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly of L1s, O2s, like how do they feel about that? Do they see any other, you know, like we know that Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Like, are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point or are they, Are they still needing to be convinced?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I've heard several executives at CYBO saying, Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard. This is the ecosystem. Having said that, and as decision makers, they also want to make sure they keep the door open and not being locked, so they move progressively. You know, 60% of the stablecoin issuance is on ECUM. I think probably 85 to 90% of all WAs, it's the same. Some similar statistics about DeFi activities. That's, you know, like electric capital, like you can see a graph like three times more like that than any other ecosystem in terms of like builders and everything. So that's the most radiant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every, every facet. And so they know, they recognize. But it doesn't mean that we need to keep educating, to keep like, you know, working with the EF for instance, like they've been incredible work for the last few months of really packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there's more like some work for instance, like, you know, like the protocol team, they're already addressing so many of the fear, like can have some different like, you know, digital asset manager in financial institution. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it's easy to understand, that's some of the work that is being done as we speak. And that's going to really help continuing solidifying that dominance position. But to also answer your question, some of those institutions they say hey we want to be multi-chain we want to look at everything which i think it's it's absolutely fair and i would do the same if i were in their shoe so okay well we they have some different assessment um you know criteria and they say well we're going to take this chain this chain this chain this chain and and then we'll see i mean go back to beyond evm i mean you've obviously got competition between ethereum and other evm flavors

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** What is the competition outside of that? Because I know you've obviously got competition within that. But are institutions doing non-EVM things as well?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** There's like cantons around. I don't know what they're using. Do institutions use Salada at all? Well, I know, but does DA still have its own big proprietary-ish stack?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** It's not proprietary anymore, but yeah. Well, Hedera. No one using Hedera.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** What are you here? Competitive. Kenton is probably the one, the most advanced in terms of like, you know, connection with the rest of the ecosystem. And I would say that not the rest, but the traditional finance, they have, they have like a way it's structured though. It's, It's something I still don't completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that you can exchange on some private market. And so some form of revenue. And then they have already like that. It's a consortium, you know, like it's a quorum V2, I would say. And they've been able to bring into their governance like a lot of the different financial institutions. So, but then once again, And if you ask me, and I'm biased, of course, but this is an ecosystem. He has a Canton code. He's open source and everything. But, well, you're still building on a technology that is not super very, there's not a lot of people. When are you going to be the CIO of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something? It's going to be, what, like 20 guys in a country that can do some work on this? And so that's the way I look at this. But I think Solana, I'm not sure, was the institution.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** I don't hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Oddly enough, Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don't hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Nobody ever used Ripple.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I've been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And I spent like almost four years at ChainSafe. Very authentic, like, you know, builders, like crypto native protocol development. And I've been to conferences, you know, with the engineers and I asked them in a very candid way, I said, have you ever built on Ripple or on some other? And I had conversation with the engineers at ChainSafe. We had some polls and we had some conversation in the Slack, I remember.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** And no one really came up with some very... Just got an infinite war chest for marketing and lobbying.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I mean, at one point, one of the cyborgs I went to years and years ago, right? Ripple was supposed to have a huge proof. And, you know, like, I guess Swift decided, oh, they're too much of a competitor. So they kicked them out.
