**[00:01] SPEAKER_00:** I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_03:** So we're using StreamYard too. We're using StreamYard and I'm just double checking.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_01:** We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit... Not all perfect, yeah. Yeah.

**[00:13] SPEAKER_00:** I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one looks pretty cool. Pretty great.

**[00:17] SPEAKER_01:** Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works?

**[00:22] SPEAKER_00:** But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to trap you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. That's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like, I can go, I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know, but at least I can go in and say, what did you do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:14] SPEAKER_00:** I find it quite, quite well. 501.

**[01:16] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, yeah.

**[01:17] SPEAKER_03:** We are live. So we are live. No, no, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good call-in show, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for Jane Jo Live in real life.

**[01:27] SPEAKER_01:** In the same room. In the same room. Amazing.

**[01:29] SPEAKER_03:** And you are a special guest. Do you want to show?

**[01:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslen. Yes. Meslen, who is the executive director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years. Healthy run.

**[01:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly.

**[01:46] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah. It's eight years now. Since 2017, yeah. February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th.

**[01:52] SPEAKER_02:** There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more.

**[01:55] SPEAKER_01:** There were meetings I was part of in December and January. Those were the first big meetings with whatever, 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2, really. It did. Those were the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[02:08] SPEAKER_02:** There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. They were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

**[02:13] SPEAKER_01:** Right. So that public launch was February. It was February. But December, there was an internal one, and then J.P. Morgan...

**[02:18] SPEAKER_03:** ...was in January 2017. But yeah, like a lot of those initial contacts had happened at Devcon 2. Yep. In October the previous year. Well, in the Devcon 2. Oh yes. Yeah. So like basically, basically there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, like the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at like a Starbucks just off site. And that was sort of the idea formation thing about the...

**[02:43] SPEAKER_01:** And then Matt spoke of NewCo held a little bar side event as well, which we have some technical issues.

**[02:47] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, okay. Hold on a second. I'm just going to push James to tell everybody to go to YouTube.

**[02:51] SPEAKER_01:** We have a technical issue, everybody.

**[02:53] SPEAKER_03:** I will fix that. Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

**[02:59] SPEAKER_02:** Space is at 5 a.m.

**[03:00] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[03:02] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, Matt spoke, held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to, and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_03:** I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that, yeah, so I think the main thing, I'm going to try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now.

**[03:17] SPEAKER_01:** If not, I am.

**[03:18] SPEAKER_03:** I did choose a...

**[03:19] SPEAKER_01:** But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff. That's right. So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group that's slightly different. NewCo was part of that. Luca was part of that. Also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves. Yeah, I'm Boxin Will, so I'm head of ecosystem at Stratum Cut.

**[03:48] SPEAKER_02:** Chairman James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. Victor Wong. Creators of Stratum Recon.

**[03:53] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**[03:56] SPEAKER_02:** That's it. Sorry, back. But yeah, Amos as well. Do you remember that? Yeah. Taiwan. Taiwan. We should check in on. I haven't thought of Amos until, in like several years until the moment.

**[04:05] SPEAKER_01:** So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep. But then they did work on like Chinese cryptography and stuff. They've got differing requirements. Right. And the Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing. Yeah.

**[04:18] SPEAKER_00:** Because you have, you know, I was not at the EEA at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to know what were the hopes and the excitement that you see. You were part of those early conversations. This was created. Yeah, I think companies, it was a pretty big event, you know. Yeah, as you mentioned, you know, like J.P. Morgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem. And what were the hopes and really like the overall atmosphere, you know, when the EEA was created like eight years ago?

**[04:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff, right? You've got many, many companies starting to get interested in, hey, we want to do a pilot. We want to get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But yeah, over those months, you really had a hell of a lot of momentum. Yeah, really, really quick.
