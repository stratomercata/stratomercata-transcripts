**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today.
[00:04] We are talking about the future of art and NFTs.
[00:07] And we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain.
[00:11] Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:13] Hey, Victor.
[00:14] Hey, everyone.
[00:15] Hey guys, thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:17] John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
[00:21] But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:27] Yeah, sure.
[00:28] So yeah, my crypto journey started around 2015, going to the Consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call.
[00:35] Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
[00:38] I worked in advertising.
[00:40] I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
[00:43] And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
[00:51] And so yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art, so I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:57] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:58] Remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
[01:01] Obviously we met there, but like, what was that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:03] Yeah, well, I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd.
[01:06] I had actually met, I think, John Lilic, which I forgot, but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center.
[01:11] I don't know if you guys remember that.
[01:13] Yeah, so I was hanging around and actually I was super into Counterparty.
[01:17] So I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated.
[01:20] You know, Vitalik's full of shit, it's not going to work.
[01:23] And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong.
[01:26] Like, this is actually super cool.
[01:28] I have no problem changing.
[01:30] I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing.
[01:32] And I was just Googling Ethereum, blockchain, hackathon.
[01:35] I was trying to get deeper involved.
[01:37] I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
[01:40] And so then I think I just Googled it and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
[01:44] And I applied with Charles and then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:48] Yeah.
[01:49] And to be clear, to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project and we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:57] Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Exactly.
[01:59] I think the Monday after, I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:04] Yeah, well, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:07] There was like a couple week consulting transition period while, you know—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:10] Yeah, I think that's true.
[02:11] Maybe it was like we started hourly, like getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:15] So with Counterparty, you could have been on Chris DeRose Tech.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:18] Yeah, exactly. If only.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:20] So what inspired SuperRare?
[02:22] Like, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
[02:28] But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:35] Yeah, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
[02:37] We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there—and watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
[02:45] I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens.
[02:48] I found it super interesting that this very small bit of standard—super simple protocol, very simple code—but the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
[02:56] And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
[03:01] It was incredible to see that happen.
[03:03] And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
[03:10] If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
[03:14] It could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
[03:17] I didn't know exactly what the business model was going to look like, but the total addressable market's probably pretty large.
[03:22] So that got me into NFTs.
[03:24] And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene—going to the art fairs.
[03:29] I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
[03:33] And it just seemed obvious.
[03:35] I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets.
[03:38] And this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
[03:40] So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:45] And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion?
[03:48] Because I know for a long time you were building and it was like, how's it going?
[03:52] And no one was really paying attention.
[03:54] And all of a sudden, next day everyone's talking about it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:57] It was absolutely crazy.
[03:58] It was hard. It was just completely surreal the whole time.
[04:01] It felt like a dream.
[04:03] We started in 2018.
[04:04] We tried to raise money. It never really worked.
[04:07] By the time we raised, we were already cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:12] So that's the best situation to possibly be in.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:14] Yeah, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea.
[04:18] So yeah, it was a grind.
[04:20] It was super volatile.
[04:21] Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life?
[04:24] But then it just really started.
[04:26] I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while.
[04:29] October 2020 was our first million-dollar month in volume.
[04:33] And I was just like, this is wild.
[04:35] Twelve months ago, the volume was like $5,000 and we made a couple hundred bucks.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:39] And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?
[04:42] I think we were trying to talk about that actually.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:44] Yeah, we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience.
[04:48] There were maybe a couple other minting tools, but we were the first to combine both.
[04:52] There weren't great minting tools then, so we started with the minting tool and then we were like, alright, I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll build the marketplace too.
[04:59] It was partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.
