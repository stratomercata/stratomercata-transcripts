**SPEAKER_01:**
Alrighty.
Well, thanks everyone for coming back.
We've done a couple of videos.
So we've done two on the early days of Ethereum,
and I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel.
And in the process, we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwell.
So, Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second,
but he actually went quite in-depth
in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum.
He wrote a long blog post that you should check out,
and we'll link in the notes.
And we asked him to join us here today to kinda dig more into the story
and also just generally catch up.
So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro,
and we can just kinda get into it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, yeah, hi.
You know, thanks so much for the invite.
You know, like I said to you guys,
you know, I love those first two videos.
You know, I'll I I I love this history,
and it was great to both hear that and
have a slightly different perspective as well.
You know, our paths have overlapped in some ways
and haven't in others.
So, you know, there are a few things that came up,
which I, you know, I wasn't myself aware of.
I mean, just for everyone's background
about me and who I am.
So I got interested in blockchain in 2014,
but it was 2015 where I really, like, kinda jumped in.
And that happened because I was working in Toronto.
I had a six month contract.
I was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum
was doing a mainnet launch.
And I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014,
but, you know, just kind of following along a little bit,
not actually doing anything.
But then moving to Toronto, it's just like orders of magnitude
more stuff going on and,
you know, meetups and, you know, Bitcoin decentral,
coworking space and everything.
So I got, like, really very addicted
through that year,
and it was like, right.
I can't not get involved.
Right?
It's like it's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever,
and you've, you know, you've met Tim Berners Lee,
and he's about to, like, go live on the web.
And it's like, you know, how can you not, like, wanna get involved?
So I just started
sort of volunteering
and helping.
My background prior to that was in the games industry,
so, like, fifteen years of C++,
fifteen years of C++ plus.
So I was like, well, you know, I can I can do something with with C++ Ethereum?
And I was really into mobile and wearables.
So my first thing I set myself is,
you know, can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch?
You know, could you get a smartwatch and go around it like, ping, there's some money?
You know, that'd be really cool.
So so yeah,
I just started doing stuff on there.
That was about the time that Gav was
parting company with with the foundation as well.
So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team.
So, you know, like that period,
I ended up being, like, I think the only person in the world who was actually helping on that.
Like, you know, no companies,
no nobody was helping.
And then I ended up getting hired into the foundation in early 2016.
And yeah, I've been involved
on Ethereum Enterprise,
Ethereum Hyperledger,
then more recently,
Ethereum Classic.
It's nearly a decade now.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.
Bob, I I well, and to be open to everyone,
like, we're old friends,
and we're happy to have you as our first guest who's on this thing.
But also,
you are like, you know, the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum Ecosystem.
You you're friends with everyone.
You know?
You got you've been in everywhere.
You know?
Like, so it's great to have your perspective on things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Thank you.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So I and for as Karen has mentioned,
for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post,
it's notional a blog post, almost a full novel,
probably a novella size.
It has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about.
Were those your personal pictures?
It's just stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just stuff I I I I had.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I mean, another thing here is
there are a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well,
which was there's one called Ethereum Foundation People and one called Ethereum Foundation Timeline.
So I made those in late 2017, early 2018
because there was no canonical history of any of this.
Yeah.
It's like, how did Ethereum start?
I mean, it's in people's heads.
It's all secondhand stories that you hear from people
that were around,
but, you know, it's like,
what's true, what isn't.
Because I think, especially on that foundation side,
it was such a mess.
Right?
Just like all different people weren't getting on,
blowing up,
kind of like parity versus the foundation
and and Charles, you know, and they're like, god.
What you know?
So it I think some people had almost taken this position
of, like, we don't talk about that.
Right?
Right.
Just because anything I say,
like, it's gonna offend somebody else.
So just la la la.
It doesn't matter that you know?
But but yeah.
So I started gathering that list of,
well, you know, who were the people that were around in the pre-foundation days
and then in in that.
And so yeah, I've got this one page, this people page,
which I think is really cool.
Just it's got so that's basically from 2013
through to early 2018
identifying anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum,
Free Foundation or who worked for the foundation in those early years.
And one of the things that's really great there is Devcon Zero,
which happened in, I think, October 2014.
So that was the very first Devcon,
but it was a closed event.
That wasn't a public event.
Yeah.
And it was
it was foundation people at that time, but there were also,
you know, some other key community sorts of people there as well.
And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions.
So there's this video that's about fifteen or twenty minutes long
of everybody,
like, hi.
I'm glad I'm here doing, you know, proof of stake research.
Just see these these so young, so many people that, you know, like, early twenties
Yeah.
You know, and turning up,
and it's like, that's, you know,
that that's so and so.
Right?
And and some of these people as well,
you know, they they they're not involved anymore.
You know, they're they're they're sort of like footnotes in history,
but but but you have that record.
And so yeah, that that that list of people I got
I got all of that together,
and the the the reason that that came about was
in late 2017, I got a message from Laura Shin
saying, hey.
I hear Ming's being sacked at the foundation.
Like, do you know anything about this?
Right.
And I said, well,
no.
I don't,
but it wouldn't surprise me.
But you know,
basically, it'd be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you,
but nobody else could tell you.
Anyway and then it sort of came out.
Well yeah, she's, you know, she's not been sacked,
but she's agreed to leave.
Right.
And then it's like, well, what's what's next?
So I contacted Vitalik and said,
you know, hey.
Is there anything I can do to help?
You know?
What can I do?
You know?
And he said,
well, the one thing you can do is
can you, like, try and talk to people
and work out, like, you know, what would good look like?
Right.
What do people think a good Ethereum Foundation would look like?
And so that started my sort of adventure really
of right.
I'm gonna go and talk to all the founders,
all the other people, and try and work out,
like, okay.
So, you know, to my mind, Bing was terrible.
So how did she get hired?
Like, what was going on,
you know, whatever, two and a half years back that that looked like a good option?
You know?
Like, how how did it work before?
You know?
Like, what how did the foundation come about?
And, like, what what were the group of leaders and,
like, what were all the dynamics between all of these people?
So yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there,
and that's that was the the the sort of the genesis for that information gathering.
And I learned a lot.
And that information as well
I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books is kind of like,
right.
There is no canonical,
but this is kind of what I found, which is maybe, like, the best information that there was at that time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well and also, it's to your point.
It's that I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about,
you know, like, everything works smooth,
but innovation
is messy.
You know, it's messy and it's like,
you know, there are million and one different paths that things could have went to,
and we just want to kind of acknowledge all that.
Like, you know, like, given where the ecosystem is today,
And even though, you know, it's amazing to me that so many people know about it,
that, you know, I spent we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain and no one,
you know, everyone just glaze over.
Right?
So it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Went a little bit farther along.
It took blurred out.
We'll just go with it.
Yeah.
One of the things that I know
the talent said, again,
it was maybe in Laura Shin's book,
was like the founding
of Ethereum
was very atypical
because it was essentially like here's here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people
who may be interested,
and it's, like, basically, like first people that turn up right, your founders.
Like, you know, a number of them, they've not even met each other before.
They've, you know, not really a lot of knowledge.
And so yeah,
like, there were lots of
interpersonal things that just didn't work at all.
It's just like no,
like founding a company,
and I'm sure you guys have, you know, have this experience yourself.
Right?
You wanna start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit
because you know that you're going through the fire together.
So, you know, you better have some stickability with you,
and, you know, common alignment
or at least knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times.
Right?
You you know, that you can work it out.
Yeah.
And what seemed to happen on Ethereum was absolutely the polar opposite of that.
It's just random bunch of people who were there,
didn't really know each other, like
make that commitment before you even know what you're even doing.
Right?
Yeah.
And so

**SPEAKER_00:**
That didn't work so great.
And I think also Let me actually I I wanted to ask about that.
I'm also just looking at the list of the Ethereum Foundation people,
which is remarkably long for the type of initiative it was.
You know, we we talk about this because we're a management team,
and we're trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such.
Do you think there is any benefits to this level of
you could call it disorganization or just you know?
I kind of think if there were,
know, a benefit and it wasn't merely just an inefficient and painful process that Ethereum succeeded in spite of,
It's kind of it embodied the ethos,
and it let people like put the idea out there
and then people fought for its destiny.
Like, Ethereum existed,
and then they wanted to be part of taking it to and he saw this with the clients and all that too.
Sorry, Jim.
Go ahead.
I was gonna say it kinda worked like a blockchain works,
in fact.
Yeah.
Lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to organize things,
and then they fight it out.
But what's that law that organization
technology reflects the organization?
Law, I think.
So yeah, something like that.
Like yes.
Sorry.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, I guess in general,
yes.
You know, having that like frothing emergent
stuff is is good.
I think where it was really screwed though,
was to do with money and and the ICO funding.
Right?
That it's basically like okay.
Here, we're doing the thing.
And here, the money is all actually in this organizational group.
And the people in that group are being funded,
you know, are in this privileged position.
It it's something which
Brian said to me in later years was it's sort of like the original sin of Ethereum.
Is if you wanna have that kind of collaboration,
so, you know, whatever stuff like the EA and Hyperledger or even just
the rather looser protocol development around Ethereum,
you don't wanna pay one team and not the others.
Right?
Because that just screws that battlefield.
So you have this situation, for example,
where you know, you got the C++ client,
you've got a Geth.
You know, you did have the Python client as well,
so you have that good triangulation,
but it was essentially like the funded ones were C++ and Go.
And then they had the money crisis of oh my god.
Is this thing even gonna happen?
Right?
We've got cutscope.
C++ is gone.
Gab ends up going out of the way.
And then you have parity,
you know, having one of the major clients
but without funding.
So it's like Geth.
Oh, Geth.
That's the favored child.
Right?
You know, that's the it's not like
the official client,
but it is the official client.
So all that sort of separation of implementation versus specification
and in that free market around that
was really skewed because the money was with Geth,
and Geth were in the foundation,
and they've got Vitalik's kind of blessing and everything.
So I I think that's where things were great
because you did have the diversity, but it wasn't fair diversity.
And I think if you look at what's happening now on
the consensus clients for,
I was gonna say ethereum two.
It's not called Ethereum Two anymore.
But, you know, the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients,
none of those consensus clients are made by the foundation.
The foundation doesn't have client teams.
They they do funding.
Like, they got the grants,
and I think all of those teams are gonna be grant recipients.
So that's kind of centralization in a way,
but it is an even playing field in terms of development.
Right?
Because you've got unevenness of funding,
and that wasn't the case,
you know, originally for Ethereum.
And I think that made a lot of bitterness as well because it's like,
well, why do you guys got the money?
Like, we're we're making another one as well and
or other parts
of the ecosystem.
Like, there wasn't a grants program for a number of years.
Yeah.
Between about 2015 and 2018,
there wasn't even a grants program.
You know, you've got the foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars,
and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything.
So so yeah,
I think the diversity is good,
but the money was bad.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Interesting.
Yeah.
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
think I
just have a comment.
It it's interesting, and maybe I commented on this in one of the other videos.
One of these rare big software projects that did not very much come from The United States.
It's Canada.
It's different parts of Europe.
You know?
And one of those confusing things, Bob,
to your point about who got paid for the clients on the foundation,
I think, like, I remember there being a deal struck with Zug,
the the the Canton basically around it.
They were like, there's tax stuff and all that sort of thing, but they also sort of intended to hire and operate locally.
They would either move there or they'd hire ETH Zurich grads or whatever.
And I don't know the the the details specifically,
but I think that didn't quite end up happening that way in
sort of as a surprise.
And I saw some of this firsthand at the meeting in which,
you know, and Charles were were, you know,
sent on their way.
The the client team set up in their own countries,
and that was, like, a bit of a flip.
Like, Gavin wanted to be in Berlin because the
I guess the devs were good and expensive, and they'd be, like, living there.
You know?
Inexpensive.
Excuse me.
And,
yeah, I think it's just
you know, you would running my own business, you would never make such a decision in such a flipped manner where, like, overnight, we're like, oh, we're in a different country.
You know?
But they that was kind of a regular
occurrence to some extent.
Major things changing,
you know, as part of how the the foundation plus
sort of operated that that I saw.
And, again, it didn't seem to hurt,
you know, quite as much as you might expect.
But yeah.
But I think,
you know, you you had to have you were lucky in how people works how excited people were about the project that that survived all of this.
And, again, from our side, you know, we're sitting in the Bay Area at that time,
and we're like, why why do they keep doing all of these things?
Like,
they're they're trying to build a thousand things,
and it's hard to build one thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, you have so there there were separate legal entities for those as well.
Right?
So you have f dev AG
in Berlin,
and then, you know, there was then there was an Amsterdam thing
for the Geth team.
You had the London stuff as well, which was mainly communications
sort of stuff,
with with Stefan and George Hallum,
Ian,
one other person who I forget.
But, you know, you sort of talk about,
you know, these people working for the Ethereum Foundation,
like but it's it was always woolly than that.
So yeah, you did have the the the
in Zug,
but most people, even if they're working full time, they weren't actually working for that.
You know?
So when I had my contract, it was with the the for profit
in Berlin .
That was who I was actually working for,
and then they were funded by
the foundation.
And and in general, that was another big split that it was.
Right?
Was the you got the foundation,
but then you had that
was, like,
the kind of umbrella group for that that was leading essentially.
So I think the the Amsterdam thing, like, rolled into Berlin .
I think that was also left side.
And that in itself was,
you know, a huge item of conflict.
I know,
again, in Laura's book,
I think Joe was talking about that, right, was was the kind of like, wanted a big chunk of money.
It's like, right, you know, the funds are there from the crowdsale now, so, you know, give them all to us.
Right?
And it's like, I
don't know that we wanna give you all the funds, like, you know,
as you go, but that, you know, that was typical of that period.
It's just a mess of complexity and interpersonal
things and organizational
complexity.
And with that with that Swiss people thing, so my understanding on that
was that was like a main motivation for, like, getting renting that
spaceship building .
Right?
Was the intention was that there were gonna be a load of people there.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.

know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.

you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,

and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**

but then the money ride ran out before it happened.

I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.

You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.

And and that that Geth team were working

you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.

Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.

So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.

and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.

You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,

Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.

yeah,

coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated

Well, you're one of the baddies.

You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.

You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,

There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.

And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.

When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?

I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,

I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.

And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.

You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.

So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,

He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And and
wait.
So see the Solidity compiler.
That was part of that C++ group too?
Yeah.
That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
But yeah.
It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.
I remember web three umbrella.
I remember the web three umbrella.
Yes.
So, yeah,
web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
you know, for for f.
It was called f.
It was just called f the executable.
So you'd have f and again,
yeah, you had f.
You had solc.
You had
mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Acute client.
You had,
which was the gooey miner.
Yeah.
That's right.
So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
And then you had one,
which was sort of
I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
I can't remember the exact scope,
but but it was sort of like, right.
You're running a node,
but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
That's a lot.
That that was a lot.
And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
But then they were all really codependent.
I mean, when I started,
one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
It's like Lib Ethereum,
Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
Dev p two p.
Live p two p.
There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
documentation all over the place.
I mean You know?
I think, you know,
I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
it's like, right.
Let's try and make this modular.
Right?
We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
But it was it was pulled apart
into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
There was no
interplace discipline on any of it.
You had to use all the latest ones together,
but then it was all split into separate repos.
So it's like, right.
You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
like, that wasn't atomic.
It was it was just a big old mess.
So yeah,
one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
and specifically
decoupling
and the tests from the client.
Right?
So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
it was literally a twenty four hour build.
It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
compiling QT,
all of this stuff.
So just to get you know?
And and there weren't binaries available
for Solsea either.
Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
you know, a smart contract to do anything.
You have to do all of that.
So I remember,
you know, after all that decomposition,
I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
And then I did, like, homebrew,
and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
And everyone's like, oh my god.
This is not great.
It was my benefit.
It's amazing.
But, yeah,
it was,
yeah,
it was a bit of a mess.
I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you know, many times trying to build things,
coming back,
looking at it,
saying, like, this can't be
my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
Can't be, like, eight hours.
Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
you know, but you're right.
It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know, talking about that,
you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
and everything.
One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
these people seem allergic to professionalism
because that seems,
you know, in an organized way.
Well, you're one of the baddies.
You know, you're the status quo.
You're trying to subvert and take it over.
You know, things as simple as,
like, like, you know, have we got,
like, technical
leads that actually lead?
You know, have have we got any project management ?
Have we got any IT ?
Have we got
anything?
And it's like, no.
It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
And
it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
But that was kind of the vibe as well.
That was seen as a good thing,
you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
Right?
You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
You know,
I I
alright.
Okay.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a premine and no token presale.
And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right,
on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for PyEthereum,
PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was
Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that,
and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But so yeah,
there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
and that would have alienated fewer people,
and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
get people to fight over it,
but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it,
that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything,
right, was several months
I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the white paper came out in November 2013,
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
so just three further days.
The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
But
then, yeah,
following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out
and you basically did have a major,
you know,
rapidly load-bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out,
and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the C++ client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid 2015,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean,
I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
But the Go client was more stable.
Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
it was often in an unstable situation.
So even when C++ Ethereum
as a client,
like, died,
it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
It's like, right.
Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
across solc,
the tests,
and C++ Ethereum.
You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
but
that will be because it was all around Gav.
Right?
You know, Gav was leading all of that.
He was he was building that client.
He was writing the yellow paper.
He was,
you know, working there with Christian and
Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
You know, all of that was was there.
And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
Right?
It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
And and that that Geth team were working
closer with Mist,
you know, with on Mist.
Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
You know, it's like Yeah.
All these groups not really talking to each other.
But but, yeah,
that would make sense.
