**SPEAKER_04:**
All righty, well thanks everyone for coming back. We've done a couple of videos—so we've done two on the early days of Ethereum, and I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel.

In the process, we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwill. So Bob, we'll ask you to introduce yourself in a second, but he actually went quite in-depth in reaction to the videos and helped to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out, and we'll link in the notes.

**SPEAKER_00:**
We asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up. So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

So yeah, hi. Thanks so much for the invite. Like I said to you guys, I loved those first two videos. I love this history, and it was great to both hear that and have a slightly different perspective as well. Our paths have overlapped in some ways and haven't in others. So there are a few things that came up which I wasn't myself aware of.

Just for everyone's background about me and who I am—I got interested in blockchain in 2014, but it was 2015 where I really kind of jumped in. That happened because I was working in Toronto. I had a six-month contract and was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum was doing a mainnet launch.

I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014, but just kind of following along a little bit, not actually doing anything. But then moving to Toronto, it's just like orders of magnitude more stuff going on—meetups and Anthony Di Iorio's Bitcoin Decentral co-working space and everything. So I got really very addicted through that year, and it was like, right, I can't not get involved.

It's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever, and you've met Tim Berners-Lee and he's about to go live on the web, and it's like, how can you not want to get involved? So I just started sort of volunteering and helping.

My background prior to that was in the games industry—so like 15 years of C++. So I was like, well, I can do something with C++ Ethereum. And I was really into mobile and wearables. So my first thing I set myself was, can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch?

Could you get a smartwatch and go around and like, bing, there's some money? That'd be really cool. So yeah, I just started doing stuff on there. That was about the time that Gav was parting company with the Foundation as well. So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team.

So during that period, I ended up being, I think, the only person in the world who was actually helping on that. No companies, nobody was helping. And then I ended up getting hired into the Foundation in early 2016.

And yeah, I've been involved in Ethereum, Enterprise Ethereum, Hyperledger, then more recently Ethereum Classic. It's nearly a decade now.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, Bob, and to be open to everyone, we're all friends, and we're happy to have you as our first guest boost on this thing. But also, you are like the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum microsystem. You're friends with everyone. You've been everywhere, so it's great to have your perspective on things. Thank you.

And as Karen has mentioned, for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post, it's notionally a blog post—almost a full novel, probably a novella size. It has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about. You dug up so much content out of there. Were those your personal pictures?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, just stuff I had. I mean, another thing here is there's a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well. One is called "Ethereum Foundation People" and one called "Ethereum Foundation Timeline."

I made those in late 2017, early 2018, because there was no canonical history of any of this. It's like, how did Ethereum start? I mean, it's in people's heads. It's all secondhand stories that you hear from people that were around. But what's true? What isn't?

Because I think especially on that Foundation side, it was such a mess. Just like all different people weren't getting on, blowing up—kind of like Parity versus the Foundation and Charles, you know, and like, God, what?

So I think some people had almost taken this position of like, we don't talk about that. Because anything I say, it's going to offend somebody else. So just la la la, it doesn't matter.

But yeah, so I started gathering that list of who were the people that were around in the pre-Foundation days and then in that. So yeah, I've got this one page, this people page, which I think is really cool.

So that's basically from 2013 through to early 2018, identifying anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum pre-Foundation or who worked for the Foundation in those early years.

And one of the things that's really great there is Devcon 0—October 2014. So that was the very first Devcon, but it was a closed event. That wasn't a public event. And it was Foundation people at that time, but there were also some other key community sorts of people there as well.

And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions. So there's this video that's about 15 or 20 minutes long of everybody like, "Hi, I'm here doing proof-of-stake research." You just see these so young, so many people that are really early 20s, turning up and it's like, that's so-and-so, right?

And some of these people as well, they're not involved anymore. They're sort of like footnotes in history. But you have that record. So yeah, that list of people, I got all of that together.

And the reason that that came about was in late 2017, I got a message from Laura Shin saying, "Hey, I hear Ming's been sacked at the Foundation. Do you know anything about this?"

And I said, "Well, no, I don't. But it wouldn't surprise me." But basically, it would be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you, but nobody else could tell you anyway.

And it sort of came out, well, yeah, she's not been sacked, but she's agreed to leave. And then it's like, well, what's next?

So I contacted Vitalik and said, "Hey, is there anything I can do to help? What can I do?" And he said, "Well, the one thing you can do is can you try and talk to people and work out what would good look like? What do people think a good Ethereum Foundation would look like?"

And so that started my sort of adventure really of like, right, I'm going to go and talk to all the founders, all the other people, and try and work out what happened.

And then that just turned into really a thought experiment on my side of like, okay, so Ming was terrible. So how did she get hired? What was going on, whatever, two and a half years back that that looked like a good option?

How did it work before? How did the Foundation come about? What were the group of leaders and what were all the dynamics between all of these people?

So yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there. And that was the genesis for that information gathering. And I learned a lot. And that information as well I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books as kind of like, right, there is no canonical, but this is kind of what I've found, which is maybe like the best information that there was at that time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, and also to your point, I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about, you know, like everything worked smooth. But innovation is messy. It's messy. And it's like, you know, there are a million and one different paths that things could have went to.

And we just want to kind of acknowledge all that. Like, given where the ecosystem is today—and even though it's amazing to me that so many people know about it now—we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain, and no one, you know, everyone just glazed over, right?

So it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Went a little bit farther. We'll just go with it. One of the things that I know that Vitalik said—again, it was maybe in Laura Shin's book—was the founding of Ethereum was very atypical.

Because it was essentially like, here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people who may be interested. And it's basically like, first people that turn up, you're the founders.

A number of them, they'd not even met each other before. Not really a lot of knowledge. And so yeah, there were lots of interpersonal things that just didn't work at all.

It's just like founding a company—and I'm sure you guys have this experience yourself—you want to start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit because you know that you're going through the fire together.

So you better have some stickability with you and common alignment or at least knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times. And you know that you can work it out.

And what seemed to happen on Ethereum was absolutely the polar opposite of that. It's just a random bunch of people who were there, didn't really know each other.
