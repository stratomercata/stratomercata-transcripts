**SPEAKER_00:**
Alrighty.
Well, thanks everyone for coming back.
We've done a couple of videos.
So we've done two on the early days of Ethereum,
and I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel.
And,
in the process, we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwell.
So,
Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second, but, he actually went quite in-depth,
you know, in in in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum, wrote a long blog post that, you should check out, and we'll link in the notes.
And
we asked him to join us here today to kinda dig more into the story and also just generally catch up.
So with that,
maybe
I'll
hand it to Bob to do a quick intro, and we can just kinda get into it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, yeah, hi.
You know, thanks so much for the invite.
You know, like I said to you guys,
you know, I love those first two videos.
You know, I'll I I I love this history,
and it was great to,
you know, both hear that and and have, you know, a slightly different perspective as well.
You know, our paths have overlapped in some ways and haven't in others.
So, you know, there are a few things that came up, which I, you know, I I I wasn't myself aware of.
I mean, just for just for everyone's background
about about me and who I am.
So I
got interested
in blockchain in 2014,
but it was 2015 where I really, like, kinda jumped in.
And that happened because I was I was working in Toronto.
I had a six month contract.
I was working in Toronto
around the same time that Ethereum
was doing a mainnet launch.
And I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014,
but, you know, just kind of following along a little bit, not actually doing anything.
But then moving to Toronto, it's just like orders of magnitude, more stuff going on and,
you know, meetups and, you
know,
Bitcoin
decentral,
coworking space and everything.
So I got, like, really very addicted
through that year, and it was like, right.
I can't not get involved.
Right?
It's like it's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever, and you've, you know, you've met Tim Berners Lee, and he's about to, like, go live on the web.
And it's like, you know, how can you not, like, wanna get involved?
So I just started
sort of volunteering
and helping.
My background prior to that was in the games industry, so, like, fifteen years of c plus
fifteen years of c plus plus.
So
I was like, well, you know, I can I can do something with with CPP Ethereum?
And I was really into mobile and wearables.
So my first thing I set myself is, you know, can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch?
You know, could you get a smartwatch and go around it like, ping, there's some money?
You know, that'd be really cool.
So
so, yeah, I just started doing stuff on there.
That was about the time that that Gav was
parting company
with with the foundation as well.
So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team.
So,
you know, like that period, I ended up being, like, I think the only person in the world who was actually helping on that.
Like, you know, no companies,
no no nobody was helping.
And then I ended up getting hired into the foundation in early twenty sixteen.
And,
yeah, I've been involved
on
Ethereum Enterprise, Ethereum Hyperledger,
then more recently,
Ethereum Classic.
It's nearly a decade now.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.
Bob, I I well, and to be open to everyone, like, we're old friends,
and we're happy to have you as our first guest who's on this thing.
But, also,
you are like, you know, the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum Ecosystem.
You you're friends with everyone.
You know?
You got you've been in everywhere.
You know?
Like, so it's great to have your perspective on things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Thank you.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So I and for as Karen has mentioned, for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post, it's
notionally a blog post, almost a full novel, probably a novella size.
It has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about.
You dug up so much content out of there.
Were those your personal pictures?
It's just stuff.
Yeah.
Just stuff I I I I had.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I mean, another
thing here is
there there's a couple of
articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well,
which was there's one called Ethereum Foundation People and one called Ethereum Foundation Timeline.
So I made those in late twenty seventeen, early twenty eighteen
because there was no canonical history of any of this.
Yeah.
It's like, how did Ethereum start?
I mean, it's in people's heads.
It's all secondhand stories that you hear from people that were around, but, you know, it's like,
what's true, what isn't.
Because I think, especially on that, like, foundation side,
it was such a mess.
Right?
Just like
all different people weren't getting on, blowing up,
kind of like
parity versus the foundation
and and Charles, you know, and they're like, god.
What you know?
So
it I think some people had almost taken this position
of, like, we don't talk about that.
Right?
Right.
Just because anything I say, like, it's gonna offend somebody else.
So just la la la.
It doesn't matter that you know?
But
yeah.
So I started gathering that list of, well, you know, who were the people that were around in the pre foundation days and then in in that.
And
so, yeah, I've got this got this one page, this people page, which I think is really cool.
Just it's got so that's basically from 2013
through to early twenty eighteen
identifying
anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum
Free Foundation
or who worked for the foundation in those early years.
And one of the things that's really great there is Devcon Zero,
which happened in, I think, October
2014.
So that was the very first Devcon, but it was a closed event.
That wasn't a public event.
Yeah.
And it was
it was foundation people at that time, but there were also, you know, some other key community sorts of people there as well.
And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions.
So there's this video that's about fifteen or twenty minutes long of everybody,
like, hi.
I'm glad I'm here doing, you know, proof of stake research.
Just see these these, you know, so young, so many people that, you know, like, early twenties
Yeah.
You know, and turning up, and it's like, that's, you know,
that that's so and so.
Right?
And and some of these people as well, you know, they they they're not involved anymore.
You know, they're they're they're sort of like footnotes in history, but but but you have that record.
And
so, yeah, that that that list of people I got I I I got all of that together, and the the the reason that that came about was
in late twenty seventeen, I got a message from Laura Shin
saying, hey.
I hear Ming's being sacked at the foundation.
Like, do you know anything about this?
Right?
And I said, well, no.
I don't,
but it wouldn't surprise me.
But,
you know, basically, it'd be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you, but nobody nobody else could tell you.
Anyway and, know, it sort of came out.
Well, yeah, she's, you know, she's not been sacked, but she's agreed to leave.
Right.
And then it's like, well, what's what's next?
So I contacted Vitalik and said, you know, hey.
Is there anything I can do to help?
You know?
What can I do?
You know?
And he said, well, the one thing you can do is can you, like, try and talk to people
and work out, like, you know, what would good look like?
Right?
What do people think a good Ethereum Foundation would look like?
And so that started my sort of adventure really of, right.
I'm gonna go and talk to all the founders, all the other people, and try and work out, like, you know, what what
and then that just turned into really a mind you know, a thought experiment on my side of, like, okay.
So, you know, to my mind, Bing was terrible.
So how did she get hired?
Like, what was going on,
you know, whatever, two and a half years back that that looked like a good option?
You know?
Like, what how how did it work before?
You know?
Like, what how did the foundation come about?
And, like, what what were the group of leaders and, like, what were all the dynamics between all of these people?
So,
yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there, and that's that was the the the sort of the genesis for that information gathering.
And I learned a lot.
And
that information as well I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books is kind of like, right.
There is no canonical,
but this is kind of what I found, which is maybe, like, the best information that there was at that time.
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well and and, also, it's to your point.
It's that I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about,
you know, like, everything works smooth, but innovation
is messy.
You know, it's messy and it's like, you know, there are million and one different paths that things could have went to, and we just want to kind of acknowledge all that.
Like, you know, like, given where the ecosystem is today,
And even though, you know, it's amazing to me that so many people know about it, that, you know, I spent we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain and no one, you know, everyone just glaze over.
Right?
So it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point.
Oh,

**SPEAKER_01:**
went a little bit farther along.
It took Blurred out.
We'll just go with it.
Yeah.
One of the things that I I know that the talent said, again, it was maybe in Laura Shin's book, was
like the the founding
of Ethereum
was very atypical
because it was essentially like,
here's here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people
who may be interested,
and it's, like, basically, like, first people that turn up right, your founders.
Like, you know, a a number of them, they'd,
you know, they've not even met each other before.
They've, you know, not really a lot of knowledge.
And
so, yeah, like, there were lots of
interpersonal
things that just didn't work at all.
It's just like,
no,
like, founding a company,
and I'm sure you guys have, you know, have this experience yourself.
Right?
You wanna start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit because you know that you're going through the fire together.
So, you know, you better have some
stickability with you and,
you know, common alignment
or at least
knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times.
Right?
You you know, that you know that you can work it out.
Yeah.
And what seemed to happen on Ethereum was absolutely the polar opposite of that.
It's just random bunch of people who were there, didn't really know each other, like,
make that commitment before you even know what you're even doing.
Right?
Yeah.
And so

**SPEAKER_00:**
that didn't work so great.
And I think also Let me actually I I wanted to ask about that.
I'm also just looking at the list of the Ethereum Foundation people, which is remarkably
long for the type of initiative it was.
You know, we we talk about this because we're a management team, and we're trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such.
Do you think there is any benefits to this level of you could call it disorganization
or just you know?
I
kind of think
if there were,
know, a benefit and it wasn't merely just an inefficient and painful process that Ethereum succeeded in spite of, It's kind of it embodied the ethos, and it it let people like, put the idea out there, and then people fought for its destiny.
Like, Ethereum existed,

**SPEAKER_03:**
and then they wanted to be part of taking it to and he saw this with the clients and all that too.
Sorry, Jim.
Go ahead.
I was gonna say it kinda worked like a blockchain works, in fact.
Yeah.
Lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to organize things, and then they fight it out.
But what's that law that organization

**SPEAKER_02:**
technology
reflects the organization?
Law,
I think.
So, yeah, something like that.
Like yes.
Sorry.
Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
I mean, I I
I guess, in general, yes.
You know, having that, like, frothing emergent,
like, stuff is is good.
I think where it was really screwed, though, was to do with money and and, you know, the ICO funding.
Right?
That it's basically like, okay.
Here, we're doing the thing.
And here, the money is all actually in this organizational group.
And the people in that group are being funded, you know, are in this privileged position.
It it's something which
Brian said to me in later years was it's sort of like the original sin of Ethereum
is
if you wanna have that kind of collaboration.
So, you know, whatever stuff like the EA and Hyperledger or even just, you know, the rather looser protocol development around Ethereum,
you don't wanna pay
one team
and not the others.
Right?
Because that just
screws that battlefield.
So
you have this situation, for example, where,
you know, you got the c plus plus client, you've got a Geth.
You you know, you did have the Python client as well, so you have that good triangulation, but it was essentially like the the the funded ones were were c plus plus and Go.
And then they have the the money crisis of of of, like, oh my god.
Is this thing even gonna happen?
Right.
We've got cutscope.
C plus plus is gone.
Gab ends up going out of the way.
And then you have parity,
you know, having one of the major clients
but without funding.
So it's like, Geth.
Oh, Geth.
That's the, you know, that's the favored child.
Right?
You know, that's the it's not like
the official client, but it is the official client.
So all that sort of, like,
separation of implementation versus specification
and, you know, in that free market around that
was really skewed
because the money was with Geth, and Geth were in the foundation,
and they've got, you know, Vitalik's kind of blessing and everything.
So I I think that's where things were great
because you did have the diversity, but it wasn't fair diversity.
And I think if you look at what's happening now on
the consensus
clients
for,
I was gonna say, ethereum two.
It's not called ethereum two anymore.
But, you know, the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients,
none of those consensus clients are made by the foundation.
The foundation doesn't have client teams.
They they do funding.
Like, they got the grants, and I think all of those teams are gonna be grant recipients.
So that's kind of centralization in a way,
but it is an even playing field in terms of the development.
Right?
Because you've got unevenness of funding, and that wasn't the case,
you know, originally for Ethereum.
And I think that that made a lot of bitterness as well because it's like, well, why do you guys got the money?
Like, we're we're making another one as well and
or or, you know, other parts
of the ecosystem.
Like, there wasn't a grants program for a number of years.
Yeah.
Between about 2015 and 2018, there wasn't even a grants program.
You know, you've got the foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars, and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything.
So
so, yeah, I think the diversity is good, but the money was bad.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Interesting.
Yeah.
I I think
alright.
That's a it's a good strong point.
So if you compare it to, like, a Bitcoin,
which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin, but it was kind of similar.
There was less of a
there was no
pre mine and no
token presale.
And so
the people who are in it were in it for general interest, and it was
really sincerely,
an even playing field.
And I I would argue, you know, in
in some ways, Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin, especially since,
you know, let's say, 02/2015.
Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes, and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
And but it's, I think,
you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
I I think it's pretty hard probably to
make step function positive changes
in a fully decentralized
manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Another
major difference there talking about clients is
it was a very deliberate decision, right, on Ethereum to to separate the specification from the clients.
Yeah.
And that there were multiple clients from day one.
I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
I was finding these the other day.
I was finding the first commits
for
for PyEthereum,
PyApp,
or PyEthereum as it was, CPP Ethereum, and and Go Ethereum.
And they were all
I think they were all November or December.
I think they were all 2013,
not even 2014 for those three.
Yeah.
And then Ethereum j looked like it started in about April,
I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But, you know, that was Yeah.
Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum h in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right?
Yeah.
We were much later.
We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
When did we get the fourth quarter twenty fourteen?
Yeah.
That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer, so starting kind of
maybe June
2014.
I got to know the project pretty well.
And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
September, October, something like that, and we started work more or less right away.
More Jim than me.
But
so, yeah, so there was a big time delay on on our side.
And and, yeah, I think okay.
Yep.
Bob, it it's an interesting point.
Right?
I think probably
they could have
there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
doing any hedging.
And then later,
I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling, and that would have alienated fewer people, and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
but it it's sort of the
idea and the community
was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
I think there was value still in this, like, throw it out there, get people to fight over it, but
it it probably overcorrected,
and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
because it wasn't the big enough time.
I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
It's like, well, the people that doing it, that was the whole world.
Right?
You know, that was everything, right, was
several month I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I'm looking at the dates.
So the the white paper came out in November
2013
sorry, 2013.
PyEthereum
was started on 11/19/2013.
Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
CPP Ethereum started four days later, twenty third of of December.
Obviously, some over Christmas hacking on these things
going on.
And then Go Ethereum
was December 26, so just three further days.
The foundation
got formed, I think, in May
or May 2014,
but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September
2014.
So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
So,
you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
Oh,
sorry.
You
know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
Right?
You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through, you had,
you know, money for early contributors,
which I think I think that was nearly 10%
Yeah.
For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for for those early months.
But
then, yeah, following that,
there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
onto those teams.
And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
because you already had a for a number of months there and that, you know, that that never got funded.
And then you
and then you guys
starting
whenever you were starting.
So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
you know, when when that team spun out and you basically did have a major,
you know, rapidly load bearing client,
and it was just, you know, unfunded,
especially in with Geth who was, you know,
had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
And then it's like, right.
Sorry.
You're out, and you're not getting any money.
You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Do you
so my memory
around the c plus plus client was that
there were funds to
do a security audit
for
two clients,
but one at a time, and it was tight.
Right?
Like And so they did go Ethereum first, and I think they did actually do the security audit on CPP Ethereum,
but I'm not quite sure.
I'm not they sure did.
You know?
You know mean?
Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
maybe there'd been an intention to do that, but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is CPP Ethereum was, like, working first,
but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
So
when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
mid
twenty fifteen,
it's like,
hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co co pays that's gotta copy it.
And then
that's what happened.
And

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean, I was I was sort of building
the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
And my memory was that the c plus
