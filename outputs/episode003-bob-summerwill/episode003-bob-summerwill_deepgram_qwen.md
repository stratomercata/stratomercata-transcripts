**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Alrighty.
[00:02] Well, thanks everyone for coming back.
[00:04] We've done a couple of videos.
[00:06] So we've done two on the early days of Ethereum,
[00:09] and I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel.
[00:15] And in the process, we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwell.
[00:21] So, Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second,
[00:24] but he actually went quite in-depth
[00:27] in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum.
[00:36] He wrote a long blog post that you should check out,
[00:41] and we'll link in the notes.
[00:45] And we asked him to join us here today to kinda dig more into the story
[00:49] and also just generally catch up.
[00:53] So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro,
[00:57] and we can just kinda get into it.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:02] So, yeah, hi.
[01:04] You know, thanks so much for the invite.
[01:06] You know, like I said to you guys,
[01:08] you know, I love those first two videos.
[01:10] You know, I'll I I I love this history,
[01:13] and it was great to both hear that and
[01:16] have a slightly different perspective as well.
[01:19] You know, our paths have overlapped in some ways
[01:22] and haven't in others.
[01:24] So, you know, there are a few things that came up,
[01:27] which I, you know, I wasn't myself aware of.
[01:30] I mean, just for everyone's background
[01:33] about me and who I am.
[01:35] So I got interested in blockchain in 2014,
[01:38] but it was 2015 where I really, like, kinda jumped in.
[01:42] And that happened because I was working in Toronto.
[01:45] I had a six month contract.
[01:47] I was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum
[01:51] was doing a mainnet launch.
[01:53] And I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014,
[01:56] but, you know, just kind of following along a little bit,
[01:59] not actually doing anything.
[02:02] But then moving to Toronto, it's just like orders of magnitude
[02:06] more stuff going on and,
[02:08] you know, meetups and, you know, Bitcoin decentral,
[02:13] coworking space and everything.
[02:15] So I got, like, really very addicted
[02:19] through that year,
[02:20] and it was like, right.
[02:22] I can't not get involved.
[02:24] Right?
[02:25] It's like it's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever,
[02:31] and you've, you know, you've met Tim Berners Lee,
[02:36] and he's about to, like, go live on the web.
[02:40] And it's like, you know, how can you not, like, wanna get involved?
[02:45] So I just started
[02:47] sort of volunteering
[02:48] and helping.
[02:49] My background prior to that was in the games industry,
[02:53] so, like, fifteen years of C++,
[02:56] fifteen years of C++ plus.
[02:59] So I was like, well, you know, I can I can do something with with C++ Ethereum?
[03:04] And I was really into mobile and wearables.
[03:07] So my first thing I set myself is,
[03:10] you know, can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch?
[03:15] You know, could you get a smartwatch and go around it like, ping, there's some money?
[03:21] You know, that'd be really cool.
[03:24] So so yeah,
[03:26] I just started doing stuff on there.
[03:29] That was about the time that Gav was
[03:32] parting company with with the foundation as well.
[03:37] So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team.
[03:41] So, you know, like that period,
[03:45] I ended up being, like, I think the only person in the world who was actually helping on that.
[03:52] Like, you know, no companies,
[03:54] no nobody was helping.
[03:56] And then I ended up getting hired into the foundation in early 2016.
[04:02] And yeah, I've been involved
[04:05] on Ethereum Enterprise,
[04:07] Ethereum Hyperledger,
[04:09] then more recently,
[04:11] Ethereum Classic.
[04:13] It's nearly a decade now.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:18] Yeah.
[04:19] Bob, I I well, and to be open to everyone,
[04:23] like, we're old friends,
[04:25] and we're happy to have you as our first guest who's on this thing.
[04:28] But also,
[04:29] you are like, you know, the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum Ecosystem.
[04:34] You you're friends with everyone.
[04:36] You know?
[04:37] You got you've been in everywhere.
[04:38] You know?
[04:39] Like, so it's great to have your perspective on things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:42] Thank you.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:45] So I and for as Karen has mentioned,
[04:47] for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post,
[04:50] it's notional a blog post, almost a full novel,
[04:53] probably a novella size.
[04:56] It has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about.
[04:59] Were those your personal pictures?
[05:01] It's just stuff.
[05:02] Yeah.
[05:03] Yeah.
[05:04] Just stuff I I I I had.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:07] I mean, another thing here is
[05:09] there are a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well,
[05:14] which was there's one called Ethereum Foundation People and one called Ethereum Foundation Timeline.
[05:20] So I made those in late 2017, early 2018
[05:23] because there was no canonical history of any of this.
[05:26] Yeah.
[05:27] It's like, how did Ethereum start?
[05:29] I mean, it's in people's heads.
[05:31] It's all secondhand stories that you hear from people
[05:34] that were around,
[05:36] but, you know, it's like,
[05:38] what's true, what isn't.
[05:40] Because I think, especially on that foundation side,
[05:44] it was such a mess.
[05:46] Right?
[05:47] Just like all different people weren't getting on,
[05:49] blowing up,
[05:51] kind of like parity versus the foundation
[05:53] and and Charles, you know, and they're like, god.
[05:56] What you know?
[05:58] So it I think some people had almost taken this position
[06:01] of, like, we don't talk about that.
[06:04] Right?
[06:05] Right.
[06:06] Just because anything I say,
[06:08] like, it's gonna offend somebody else.
[06:11] So just la la la.
[06:13] It doesn't matter that you know?
[06:15] But but yeah.
[06:17] So I started gathering that list of,
[06:20] well, you know, who were the people that were around in the pre-foundation days
[06:24] and then in in that.
[06:28] And so yeah, I've got this one page, this people page,
[06:31] which I think is really cool.
[06:33] Just it's got so that's basically from 2013
[06:37] through to early 2018
[06:40] identifying anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum,
[06:45] Free Foundation or who worked for the foundation in those early years.
[06:50] And one of the things that's really great there is Devcon Zero,
[06:53] which happened in, I think, October 2014.
[06:57] So that was the very first Devcon,
[06:59] but it was a closed event.
[07:02] That wasn't a public event.
[07:04] Yeah.
[07:05] And it was
[07:06] it was foundation people at that time, but there were also,
[07:10] you know, some other key community sorts of people there as well.
[07:13] And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions.
[07:18] So there's this video that's about fifteen or twenty minutes long
[07:22] of everybody,
[07:24] like, hi.
[07:25] I'm glad I'm here doing, you know, proof of stake research.
[07:31] Just see these these so young, so many people that, you know, like, early twenties
[07:36] Yeah.
[07:38] You know, and turning up,
[07:40] and it's like, that's, you know,
[07:42] that that's so and so.
[07:45] Right?
[07:46] And and some of these people as well,
[07:48] you know, they they they're not involved anymore.
[07:51] You know, they're they're they're sort of like footnotes in history,
[07:55] but but but you have that record.
[07:59] And so yeah, that that that list of people I got
[08:03] I got all of that together,
[08:06] and the the the reason that that came about was
[08:10] in late 2017, I got a message from Laura Shin
[08:14] saying, hey.
[08:15] I hear Ming's being sacked at the foundation.
[08:19] Like, do you know anything about this?
[08:22] Right.
[08:23] And I said, well,
[08:24] no.
[08:25] I don't,
[08:27] but it wouldn't surprise me.
[08:29] But you know,
[08:31] basically, it'd be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you,
[08:34] but nobody else could tell you.
[08:36] Anyway and then it sort of came out.
[08:40] Well yeah, she's, you know, she's not been sacked,
[08:42] but she's agreed to leave.
[08:45] Right.
[08:47] And then it's like, well, what's what's next?
[08:51] So I contacted Vitalik and said,
[08:54] you know, hey.
[08:56] Is there anything I can do to help?
[08:59] You know?
[09:01] What can I do?
[09:03] You know?
[09:04] And he said,
[09:06] well, the one thing you can do is
[09:08] can you, like, try and talk to people
[09:12] and work out, like, you know, what would good look like?
[09:17] Right.
[09:18] What do people think a good Ethereum Foundation would look like?
[09:23] And so that started my sort of adventure really
[09:26] of right.
[09:28] I'm gonna go and talk to all the founders,
[09:31] all the other people, and try and work out,
[09:35] like, okay.
[09:37] So, you know, to my mind, Bing was terrible.
[09:42] So how did she get hired?
[09:46] Like, what was going on,
[09:48] you know, whatever, two and a half years back that that looked like a good option?
[09:53] You know?
[09:55] Like, how how did it work before?
[09:57] You know?
[10:00] Like, what how did the foundation come about?
[10:02] And, like, what what were the group of leaders and,
[10:06] like, what were all the dynamics between all of these people?
[10:10] So yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there,
[10:14] and that's that was the the the sort of the genesis for that information gathering.
[10:20] And I learned a lot.
[10:23] And that information as well
[10:25] I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books is kind of like,
[10:30] right.
[10:31] There is no canonical,
[10:34] but this is kind of what I found, which is maybe, like, the best information that there was at that time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[10:40] Well and also, it's to your point.
[10:43] It's that I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about,
[10:47] you know, like, everything works smooth,
[10:50] but innovation
[10:52] is messy.
[10:54] You know, it's messy and it's like,
[10:56] you know, there are million and one different paths that things could have went to,
[11:01] and we just want to kind of acknowledge all that.
[11:04] Like, you know, like, given where the ecosystem is today,
[11:08] And even though, you know, it's amazing to me that so many people know about it,
[11:13] that, you know, I spent we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain and no one,
[11:20] you know, everyone just glaze over.
[11:24] Right?
[11:25] So it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:30] Went a little bit farther along.
[11:33] It took blurred out.
[11:36] We'll just go with it.
[11:38] Yeah.
[11:40] One of the things that I know
[11:42] the talent said, again,
[11:45] it was maybe in Laura Shin's book,
[11:49] was like the founding
[11:53] of Ethereum
[11:54] was very atypical
[11:56] because it was essentially like here's here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people
[12:02] who may be interested,
[12:04] and it's, like, basically, like first people that turn up right, your founders.
[12:10] Like, you know, a number of them, they've not even met each other before.
[12:15] They've, you know, not really a lot of knowledge.
[12:18] And so yeah,
[12:20] like, there were lots of
[12:22] interpersonal things that just didn't work at all.
[12:26] It's just like no,
[12:29] like founding a company,
[12:31] and I'm sure you guys have, you know, have this experience yourself.
[12:35] Right?
[12:37] You wanna start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit
[12:40] because you know that you're going through the fire together.
[12:46] So, you know, you better have some stickability with you,
[12:50] and, you know, common alignment
[12:53] or at least knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times.
[12:59] Right?
[13:01] You you know, that you can work it out.
[13:04] Yeah.
[13:06] And what seemed to happen on Ethereum was absolutely the polar opposite of that.
[13:11] It's just random bunch of people who were there,
[13:15] didn't really know each other, like
[13:18] make that commitment before you even know what you're even doing.
[13:24] Right?
[13:26] Yeah.
[13:27] And so

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:30] That didn't work so great.
[13:33] And I think also Let me actually I I wanted to ask about that.
[13:38] I'm also just looking at the list of the Ethereum Foundation people,
[13:42] which is remarkably long for the type of initiative it was.
[13:46] You know, we we talk about this because we're a management team,
[13:50] and we're trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such.
[13:57] Do you think there is any benefits to this level of
[14:02] you could call it disorganization or just you know?
[14:06] I kind of think if there were,
[14:09] know, a benefit and it wasn't merely just an inefficient and painful process that Ethereum succeeded in spite of,
[14:17] It's kind of it embodied the ethos,
[14:21] and it let people like put the idea out there
[14:25] and then people fought for its destiny.
[14:28] Like, Ethereum existed,
[14:30] and then they wanted to be part of taking it to and he saw this with the clients and all that too.
[14:37] Sorry, Jim.
[14:39] Go ahead.
[14:41] I was gonna say it kinda worked like a blockchain works,
[14:45] in fact.
[14:46] Yeah.
[14:48] Lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to organize things,
[14:53] and then they fight it out.
[14:57] But what's that law that organization
[15:02] technology reflects the organization?
[15:04] Law, I think.
[15:06] So yeah, something like that.
[15:08] Like yes.
[15:10] Sorry.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:13] Yeah.
[15:14] I mean, I guess in general,
[15:17] yes.
[15:19] You know, having that like frothing emergent
[15:22] stuff is is good.
[15:24] I think where it was really screwed though,
[15:28] was to do with money and and the ICO funding.
[15:33] Right?
[15:34] That it's basically like okay.
[15:37] Here, we're doing the thing.
[15:39] And here, the money is all actually in this organizational group.
[15:44] And the people in that group are being funded,
[15:48] you know, are in this privileged position.
[15:50] It it's something which
[15:53] Brian said to me in later years was it's sort of like the original sin of Ethereum.
[15:59] Is if you wanna have that kind of collaboration,
[16:04] so, you know, whatever stuff like the EA and Hyperledger or even just
[16:08] the rather looser protocol development around Ethereum,
[16:12] you don't wanna pay one team and not the others.
[16:17] Right?
[16:19] Because that just screws that battlefield.
[16:23] So you have this situation, for example,
[16:26] where you know, you got the C++ client,
[16:29] you've got a Geth.
[16:31] You know, you did have the Python client as well,
[16:35] so you have that good triangulation,
[16:38] but it was essentially like the funded ones were C++ and Go.
[16:44] And then they had the money crisis of oh my god.
[16:49] Is this thing even gonna happen?
[16:52] Right?
[16:53] We've got cutscope.
[16:55] C++ is gone.
[16:57] Gab ends up going out of the way.
[16:59] And then you have parity,
[17:02] you know, having one of the major clients
[17:05] but without funding.
[17:08] So it's like Geth.
[17:11] Oh, Geth.
[17:13] That's the favored child.
[17:16] Right?
[17:17] You know, that's the it's not like
[17:20] the official client,
[17:22] but it is the official client.
[17:25] So all that sort of separation of implementation versus specification
[17:30] and in that free market around that
[17:34] was really skewed because the money was with Geth,
[17:38] and Geth were in the foundation,
[17:42] and they've got Vitalik's kind of blessing and everything.
[17:46] So I I think that's where things were great
[17:50] because you did have the diversity, but it wasn't fair diversity.
[17:56] And I think if you look at what's happening now on
[18:00] the consensus clients for,
[18:03] I was gonna say ethereum two.
[18:06] It's not called Ethereum Two anymore.
[18:09] But, you know, the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients,
[18:15] none of those consensus clients are made by the foundation.
[18:19] The foundation doesn't have client teams.
[18:23] They they do funding.
[18:26] Like, they got the grants,
[18:28] and I think all of those teams are gonna be grant recipients.
[18:34] So that's kind of centralization in a way,
[18:37] but it is an even playing field in terms of development.
[18:42] Right?
[18:44] Because you've got unevenness of funding,
[18:47] and that wasn't the case,
[18:50] you know, originally for Ethereum.
[18:53] And I think that made a lot of bitterness as well because it's like,
[18:56] well, why do you guys got the money?
[18:59] Like, we're we're making another one as well and
[19:02] or other parts
[19:03] of the ecosystem.
[19:04] Like, there wasn't a grants program for a number of years.
[19:08] Yeah.
[19:09] Between about 2015 and 2018,
[19:13] there wasn't even a grants program.
[19:16] You know, you've got the foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars,
[19:21] and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything.
[19:25] So so yeah,
[19:27] I think the diversity is good,
[19:30] but the money was bad.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:34] Interesting.
[19:36] Yeah.
[19:37] I I
[19:38] alright.
[19:40] Okay.
[19:42] That's a it's a good strong point.
[19:45] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[19:49] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[19:53] but it was kind of similar.
[19:56] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[20:01] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[20:05] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[20:10] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[20:16] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[20:23] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[20:28] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[20:34] And but it's, I think,
[20:36] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[20:41] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[20:47] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:51] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[20:56] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[20:59] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[21:04] Yeah.
[21:05] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[21:08] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[21:13] I was finding these the other day.
[21:16] I was finding the first commits
[21:19] for PyEthereum,
[21:21] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[21:27] and Go Ethereum.
[21:30] And they were all
[21:32] I think they were all November or December.
[21:36] I think they were all 2013,
[21:39] not even 2014 for those three.
[21:42] Yeah.
[21:43] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[21:48] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:51] But, you know, that was
[21:53] Yeah.
[21:54] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[21:58] Right?
[21:59] Yeah.
[22:00] We were much later.
[22:03] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[22:06] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[22:08] Yeah.
[22:09] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:12] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[22:16] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[22:20] I got to know the project pretty well.
[22:23] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[22:27] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[22:31] September, October, something like that,
[22:35] and we started work more or less right away.
[22:40] More Jim than me.
[22:42] But so yeah,
[22:44] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[22:48] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[22:51] Yep.
[22:53] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[22:56] Right?
[22:57] I think probably
[22:59] they could have
[23:01] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[23:08] doing any hedging.
[23:11] And then later,
[23:14] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[23:20] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[23:25] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[23:30] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[23:34] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[23:39] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[23:45] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[23:50] get people to fight over it,
[23:53] but
[23:54] it it probably overcorrected,
[23:57] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:01] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[24:04] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[24:08] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[24:13] that was the whole world.
[24:15] Right?
[24:16] You know, that was everything,
[24:19] right, was several months
[24:23] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[24:28] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[24:32] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:35] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[24:37] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[24:42] sorry, 2013.
[24:46] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[24:51] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[24:57] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[25:03] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[25:08] going on.
[25:10] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[25:14] so just three further days.
[25:17] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[25:23] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[25:29] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[25:34] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[25:39] So,
[25:40] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[25:46] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[25:49] Oh,
[25:51] sorry.
[25:52] You
[25:53] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[25:58] Right?
[26:00] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[26:04] you had,
[26:05] you know, money for early contributors,
[26:10] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[26:13] Yeah.
[26:14] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[26:19] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[26:25] But
[26:27] then, yeah,
[26:28] following that,
[26:30] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[26:34] onto those teams.
[26:36] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[26:41] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[26:47] you know, that that never got funded.
[26:50] And then you
[26:52] and then you guys starting
[26:53] whenever you were starting.
[26:55] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[27:01] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[27:06] you know, when when that team spun out
[27:09] and you basically did have a major,
[27:13] you know,
[27:14] rapidly load-bearing client,
[27:18] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[27:22] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[27:26] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[27:30] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[27:35] And then it's like, right.
[27:38] Sorry.
[27:39] You're out,
[27:41] and you're not getting any money.
[27:44] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[27:46] Yes.
[27:47] Do you
[27:48] so my memory
[27:50] around the C++ client was that
[27:53] there were funds to
[27:55] do a security audit
[27:57] for
[27:58] two clients,
[27:59] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[28:04] Right?
[28:05] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[28:10] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[28:16] but I'm not quite sure.
[28:19] I'm not they sure did.
[28:23] You know?
[28:24] You know mean?
[28:25] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:27] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[28:31] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[28:36] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[28:42] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[28:50] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[28:57] mid 2015,
[28:59] it's like,
[29:01] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[29:06] And then
[29:07] that's what happened.
[29:08] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[29:11] I mean,
[29:12] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[29:19] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[29:26] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[29:30] But the Go client was more stable.
[29:34] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[29:39] it was often in an unstable situation.
[29:43] So even when C++ Ethereum
[29:47] as a client,
[29:48] like, died,
[29:50] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[29:56] It's like, right.
[29:58] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[30:04] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[30:10] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[30:15] across solc,
[30:17] the tests,
[30:18] and C++ Ethereum.
[30:20] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[30:29] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[30:34] but
[30:35] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[30:38] Right?
[30:39] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[30:42] He was he was building that client.
[30:46] He was writing the yellow paper.
[30:49] He was,
[30:51] you know, working there with Christian and
[30:54] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[30:58] You know, all of that was was there.
[31:02] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[31:06] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[31:10] Right?
[31:11] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[31:14] And and that that Geth team were working
[31:17] closer with Mist,
[31:20] you know, with on Mist.
[31:23] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[31:29] You know, it's like Yeah.
[31:31] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[31:34] But but, yeah,
[31:36] that would make sense.
[31:38] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[31:42] And and
[31:43] wait.
[31:45] So see the Solidity compiler.
[31:47] That was part of that C++ group too?
[31:50] Yeah.
[31:51] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[31:56] But yeah.
[31:57] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[32:00] Okay.
[32:01] I remember web three umbrella.
[32:04] I remember the web three umbrella.
[32:06] Yes.
[32:07] So, yeah,
[32:08] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[32:13] you know, for for f.
[32:15] It was called f.
[32:17] It was just called f the executable.
[32:21] So you'd have f and again,
[32:24] yeah, you had f.
[32:26] You had solc.
[32:28] You had
[32:29] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[32:31] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[32:33] Acute client.
[32:35] You had,
[32:36] which was the gooey miner.
[32:40] Yeah.
[32:41] That's right.
[32:42] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[32:48] And then you had one,
[32:50] which was sort of
[32:51] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[32:57] I can't remember the exact scope,
[32:59] but but it was sort of like, right.
[33:01] You're running a node,
[33:04] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[33:06] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[33:12] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[33:17] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[33:20] That's a lot.
[33:22] That that was a lot.
[33:24] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[33:31] Right?
[33:32] Right.
[33:33] Right.
[33:34] Right.
[33:35] But then they were all really codependent.
[33:38] I mean, when I started,
[33:40] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[33:46] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[33:49] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[33:52] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[33:55] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[33:58] Yeah.
[34:00] Dev p two p.
[34:01] Live p two p.
[34:02] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[34:06] documentation all over the place.
[34:08] I mean You know?
[34:10] I think, you know,
[34:12] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[34:19] it's like, right.
[34:21] Let's try and make this modular.
[34:25] Right?
[34:26] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[34:32] But it was it was pulled apart
[34:37] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[34:43] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[34:48] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[34:52] There was no
[34:53] interplace discipline on any of it.
[34:56] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[34:59] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[35:03] So it's like, right.
[35:05] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[35:12] like, that wasn't atomic.
[35:14] It was it was just a big old mess.
[35:18] So yeah,
[35:19] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[35:26] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[35:30] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[35:34] and specifically
[35:36] decoupling
[35:37] and the tests from the client.
[35:41] Right?
[35:42] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[35:48] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[35:52] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[35:57] compiling QT,
[36:00] all of this stuff.
[36:02] So just to get you know?
[36:04] And and there weren't binaries available
[36:08] for Solsea either.
[36:11] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[36:17] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[36:20] You have to do all of that.
[36:22] So I remember,
[36:24] you know, after all that decomposition,
[36:28] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[36:31] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[36:35] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[36:40] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[36:42] This is not great.
[36:44] It was my benefit.
[36:47] It's amazing.
[36:49] But, yeah,
[36:51] it was,
[36:52] yeah,
[36:53] it was a bit of a mess.
[36:56] I I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[37:00] you know, many times trying to build things,
[37:04] coming back,
[37:05] looking at it,
[37:06] saying, like, this can't be
[37:10] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[37:15] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[37:18] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[37:24] you know, but you're right.
[37:26] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[37:30] You know, talking about that,
[37:32] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[37:38] and everything.
[37:40] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[37:45] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[37:49] because that seems,
[37:51] you know, in an organized way.
[37:54] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[37:56] You know, you're the status quo.
[37:58] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[38:01] You know, things as simple as,
[38:04] like, like, you know, have we got,
[38:06] like, technical
[38:07] leads that actually lead?
[38:10] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[38:15] Have we got any IT ?
[38:17] Have we got
[38:19] anything?
[38:20] And it's like, no.
[38:22] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[38:26] And
[38:27] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[38:34] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[38:37] That was seen as a good thing,
[38:40] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[38:45] Right?
[38:46] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[38:51] Yeah.
[38:52] You know,
[38:53] I I
[38:54] think I
[38:56] just have a comment.
[39:00] It it's interesting, and maybe I commented on this in one of the other videos.
[39:05] One of these rare big software projects that did not very much come from The United States.
[39:12] It's Canada.
[39:14] It's different parts of Europe.
[39:17] You know?
[39:18] And one of those confusing things, Bob,
[39:22] to your point about who got paid for the clients on the foundation,
[39:26] I think, like, I remember there being a deal struck with Zug,
[39:30] the the the Canton basically around it.
[39:34] They were like, there's tax stuff and all that sort of thing, but they also sort of intended to hire and operate locally.
[39:41] They would either move there or they'd hire ETH Zurich grads or whatever.
[39:48] And I don't know the the the details specifically,
[39:52] but I think that didn't quite end up happening that way in
[39:57] sort of as a surprise.
[40:01] And I saw some of this firsthand at the meeting in which,
[40:06] you know, and Charles were were, you know,
[40:10] sent on their way.
[40:12] The the client team set up in their own countries,
[40:17] and that was, like, a bit of a flip.
[40:20] Like, Gavin wanted to be in Berlin because the
[40:25] I guess the devs were good and expensive, and they'd be, like, living there.
[40:31] You know?
[40:32] Inexpensive.
[40:34] Excuse me.
[40:36] And,
[40:37] yeah, I think it's just
[40:39] you know, you would running my own business, you would never make such a decision in such a flipped manner where, like, overnight, we're like, oh, we're in a different country.
[40:48] You know?
[40:50] But they that was kind of a regular
[40:52] occurrence to some extent.
[40:54] Major things changing,
[40:56] you know, as part of how the the foundation plus
[41:00] sort of operated that that I saw.
[41:03] And, again, it didn't seem to hurt,
[41:07] you know, quite as much as you might expect.
[41:12] But yeah.
[41:13] But I think,
[41:15] you know, you you had to have you were lucky in how people works how excited people were about the project that that survived all of this.
[41:23] And, again, from our side, you know, we're sitting in the Bay Area at that time,
[41:28] and we're like, why why do they keep doing all of these things?
[41:33] Like,
[41:35] they're they're trying to build a thousand things,
[41:37] and it's hard to build one thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[41:42] Yeah.
[41:43] I mean, you have so there there were separate legal entities for those as well.
[41:48] Right?
[41:49] So you have f dev AG
[41:52] in Berlin,
[41:53] and then, you know, there was then there was an Amsterdam thing
[41:57] for the Geth team.
[41:59] You had the London stuff as well, which was mainly communications
[42:04] sort of stuff,
[42:06] with with Stefan and George Hallum,
[42:09] Ian,
[42:10] one other person who I forget.
[42:13] But, you know, you sort of talk about,
[42:17] you know, these people working for the Ethereum Foundation,
[42:20] like but it's it was always woolly than that.
[42:25] So yeah, you did have the the the
[42:28] in Zug,
[42:30] but most people, even if they're working full time, they weren't actually working for that.
[42:36] You know?
[42:37] So when I had my contract, it was with the the for profit
[42:41] in Berlin .
[42:43] That was who I was actually working for,
[42:45] and then they were funded by
[42:48] the foundation.
[42:50] And and in general, that was another big split that it was.
[42:56] Right?
[42:57] Was the you got the foundation,
[43:00] but then you had that
[43:01] was, like,
[43:02] the kind of umbrella group for that that was leading essentially.
[43:08] So I think the the Amsterdam thing, like, rolled into Berlin .
[43:13] I think that was also left side.
[43:16] And that in itself was,
[43:19] you know, a huge item of conflict.
[43:23] I know,
[43:25] again, in Laura's book,
[43:28] I think Joe was talking about that, right, was was the kind of like, wanted a big chunk of money.
[43:36] It's like, right, you know, the funds are there from the crowdsale now, so, you know, give them all to us.
[43:42] Right?
[43:43] And it's like, I
[43:45] don't know that we wanna give you all the funds, like, you know,
[43:49] as you go, but that, you know, that was typical of that period.
[43:54] It's just a mess of complexity and interpersonal
[43:58] things and organizational
[44:01] complexity.
[44:02] And with that with that Swiss people thing, so my understanding on that
[44:07] was that was like a main motivation for, like, getting renting that
[44:13] spaceship building .
[44:15] Right?
[44:16] Was the intention was that there were gonna be a load of people there.
[44:21] You know, it's like Yeah.
[44:23] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[44:27] But but, yeah,
[44:29] that would make sense.
[44:30] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[44:35] And and
[44:36] wait.
[44:38] So see the Solidity compiler.
[44:41] That was part of that C++ group too?
[44:44] Yeah.
[44:45] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[44:49] But yeah.
[44:50] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[44:53] Okay.
[44:55] I remember web three umbrella.
[44:58] I remember the web three umbrella.
[45:00] Yes.
[45:01] So, yeah,
[45:02] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[45:07] you know, for for f.
[45:09] It was called f.
[45:11] It was just called f the executable.
[45:15] So you'd have f and again,
[45:18] yeah, you had f.
[45:20] You had solc.
[45:22] You had
[45:23] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[45:26] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[45:28] Acute client.
[45:30] You had,
[45:31] which was the gooey miner.
[45:35] Yeah.
[45:37] That's right.
[45:39] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[45:46] And then you had one,
[45:48] which was sort of
[45:49] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[45:55] I can't remember the exact scope,
[45:57] but but it was sort of like, right.
[46:00] You're running a node,
[46:03] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[46:05] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[46:12] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[46:17] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[46:20] That's a lot.
[46:22] That that was a lot.
[46:24] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[46:31] Right?
[46:32] Right.
[46:33] Right.
[46:34] Right.
[46:35] But then they were all really codependent.
[46:40] I mean, when I started,
[46:42] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[46:48] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[46:51] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[46:54] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[46:57] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[47:00] Yeah.
[47:02] Dev p two p.
[47:03] Live p two p.
[47:04] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[47:08] documentation all over the place.
[47:10] I mean You know?
[47:12] I think, you know,
[47:15] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[47:23] it's like, right.
[47:25] Let's try and make this modular.
[47:29] Right?
[47:30] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[47:36] But it was it was pulled apart
[47:41] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[47:48] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[47:52] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[47:56] There was no
[47:57] interplace discipline on any of it.
[48:01] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[48:04] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[48:09] So it's like, right.
[48:11] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[48:17] like, that wasn't atomic.
[48:20] It was it was just a big old mess.
[48:25] So yeah,
[48:26] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[48:33] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[48:37] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[48:41] and specifically
[48:42] decoupling
[48:43] and the tests from the client.
[48:46] Right?
[48:47] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[48:53] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[49:00] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[49:05] compiling QT,
[49:08] all of this stuff.
[49:10] So just to get you know?
[49:12] And and there weren't binaries available
[49:16] for Solsea either.
[49:19] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[49:25] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[49:28] You have to do all of that.
[49:30] So I remember,
[49:32] you know, after all that decomposition,
[49:36] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[49:39] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[49:43] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[49:50] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[49:52] This is not great.
[49:54] It was my benefit.
[49:57] It's amazing.
[50:00] But, yeah,
[50:01] it was,
[50:02] yeah,
[50:03] it was a bit of a mess.
[50:06] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[50:10] you know, many times trying to build things,
[50:14] coming back,
[50:15] looking at it,
[50:17] saying, like, this can't be
[50:21] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[50:26] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[50:30] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[50:37] you know, but you're right.
[50:39] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[50:42] You know, talking about that,
[50:44] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[50:48] and everything.
[50:50] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[50:55] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[50:59] because that seems,
[51:01] you know, in an organized way.
[51:04] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[51:06] You know, you're the status quo.
[51:08] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[51:12] You know, things as simple as,
[51:14] like, like, you know, have we got,
[51:17] like, technical
[51:18] leads that actually lead?
[51:20] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[51:26] Have we got any IT ?
[51:28] Have we got
[51:30] anything?
[51:31] And it's like, no.
[51:33] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[51:37] And
[51:38] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[51:46] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[51:49] That was seen as a good thing,
[51:52] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[51:57] Right?
[51:58] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[52:03] Yeah.
[52:04] You know,
[52:06] I I
[52:07] alright.
[52:10] Okay.
[52:11] That's a it's a good strong point.
[52:14] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[52:18] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[52:23] but it was kind of similar.
[52:26] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[52:30] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[52:34] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[52:39] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[52:46] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[52:53] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[52:58] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[53:04] And but it's, I think,
[53:06] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[53:11] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[53:17] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[53:21] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[53:26] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[53:29] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[53:34] Yeah.
[53:35] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[53:38] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[53:43] I was finding these the other day.
[53:46] I was finding the first commits
[53:49] for PyEthereum,
[53:51] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[53:58] and Go Ethereum.
[54:01] And they were all
[54:02] I think they were all November or December.
[54:06] I think they were all 2013,
[54:09] not even 2014 for those three.
[54:12] Yeah.
[54:13] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[54:18] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[54:21] But, you know, that was
[54:23] Yeah.
[54:24] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[54:28] Right?
[54:29] Yeah.
[54:30] We were much later.
[54:33] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[54:36] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[54:38] Yeah.
[54:39] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[54:42] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[54:46] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[54:50] I got to know the project pretty well.
[54:53] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[54:57] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[55:01] September, October, something like that,
[55:06] and we started work more or less right away.
[55:11] More Jim than me.
[55:13] But so yeah,
[55:15] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[55:19] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[55:22] Yep.
[55:24] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[55:27] Right?
[55:28] I think probably
[55:30] they could have
[55:31] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[55:38] doing any hedging.
[55:41] And then later,
[55:44] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[55:50] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[55:55] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[56:01] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[56:05] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[56:10] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[56:17] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[56:23] get people to fight over it,
[56:26] but
[56:27] it it probably overcorrected,
[56:30] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[56:34] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[56:38] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[56:42] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[56:47] that was the whole world.
[56:49] Right?
[56:50] You know, that was everything,
[56:53] right, was several months
[56:58] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[57:03] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[57:07] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[57:08] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[57:10] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[57:14] sorry, 2013.
[57:18] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[57:23] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[57:28] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[57:34] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[57:39] going on.
[57:41] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[57:45] so just three further days.
[57:48] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[57:53] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[57:59] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[58:04] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[58:09] So,
[58:10] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[58:16] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[58:20] Oh,
[58:21] sorry.
[58:23] You
[58:24] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[58:29] Right?
[58:31] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[58:36] you had,
[58:37] you know, money for early contributors,
[58:42] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[58:45] Yeah.
[58:46] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[58:51] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[58:57] But
[58:59] then, yeah,
[59:01] following that,
[59:03] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[59:06] onto those teams.
[59:08] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[59:14] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[59:20] you know, that that never got funded.
[59:23] And then you
[59:25] and then you guys starting
[59:26] whenever you were starting.
[59:28] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[59:34] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[59:38] you know, when when that team spun out
[59:41] and you basically did have a major,
[59:46] you know,
[59:47] rapidly load-bearing client,
[59:50] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[59:54] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[59:58] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[60:03] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[60:08] And then it's like, right.
[60:11] Sorry.
[60:12] You're out,
[60:14] and you're not getting any money.
[60:17] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[60:19] Yes.
[60:20] Do you
[60:21] so my memory
[60:23] around the C++ client was that
[60:25] there were funds to
[60:27] do a security audit
[60:29] for
[60:30] two clients,
[60:31] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[60:36] Right?
[60:38] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[60:43] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[60:49] but I'm not quite sure.
[60:52] I'm not they sure did.
[60:56] You know?
[60:57] You know mean?
[60:58] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[61:00] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[61:04] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[61:09] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[61:15] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[61:23] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[61:30] mid 2015,
[61:32] it's like,
[61:34] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[61:39] And then
[61:40] that's what happened.
[61:41] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[61:45] I mean,
[61:47] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[61:54] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[62:00] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[62:03] But the Go client was more stable.
[62:07] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[62:12] it was often in an unstable situation.
[62:15] So even when C++ Ethereum
[62:19] as a client,
[62:20] like, died,
[62:22] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[62:28] It's like, right.
[62:30] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[62:37] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[62:43] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[62:48] across solc,
[62:50] the tests,
[62:51] and C++ Ethereum.
[62:53] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[63:04] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[63:10] but
[63:11] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[63:15] Right?
[63:16] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[63:20] He was he was building that client.
[63:24] He was writing the yellow paper.
[63:27] He was,
[63:29] you know, working there with Christian and
[63:32] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[63:36] You know, all of that was was there.
[63:40] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[63:44] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[63:48] Right?
[63:49] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[63:52] And and that that Geth team were working
[63:55] closer with Mist,
[63:57] you know, with on Mist.
[64:00] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[64:06] You know, it's like Yeah.
[64:08] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[64:11] But but, yeah,
[64:13] that would make sense.
[64:15] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[64:19] And and
[64:20] wait.
[64:22] So see the Solidity compiler.
[64:25] That was part of that C++ group too?
[64:28] Yeah.
[64:29] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[64:33] But yeah.
[64:34] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[64:37] Okay.
[64:38] I remember web three umbrella.
[64:41] I remember the web three umbrella.
[64:43] Yes.
[64:45] So, yeah,
[64:46] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[64:51] you know, for for f.
[64:53] It was called f.
[64:55] It was just called f the executable.
[65:00] So you'd have f and again,
[65:02] yeah, you had f.
[65:04] You had solc.
[65:06] You had
[65:07] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[65:10] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[65:12] Acute client.
[65:14] You had,
[65:15] which was the gooey miner.
[65:19] Yeah.
[65:20] That's right.
[65:21] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[65:28] And then you had one,
[65:30] which was sort of
[65:31] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[65:37] I can't remember the exact scope,
[65:39] but but it was sort of like, right.
[65:42] You're running a node,
[65:45] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[65:48] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[65:55] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[66:01] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[66:04] That's a lot.
[66:06] That that was a lot.
[66:08] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[66:15] Right?
[66:17] Right.
[66:19] Right.
[66:20] Right.
[66:21] But then they were all really codependent.
[66:24] I mean, when I started,
[66:26] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[66:32] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[66:35] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[66:38] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[66:41] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[66:44] Yeah.
[66:46] Dev p two p.
[66:47] Live p two p.
[66:48] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[66:52] documentation all over the place.
[66:54] I mean You know?
[66:56] I think, you know,
[67:00] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[67:08] it's like, right.
[67:10] Let's try and make this modular.
[67:14] Right?
[67:15] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[67:21] But it was it was pulled apart
[67:26] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[67:32] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[67:36] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[67:40] There was no
[67:41] interplace discipline on any of it.
[67:45] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[67:48] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[67:53] So it's like, right.
[67:55] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[68:02] like, that wasn't atomic.
[68:04] It was it was just a big old mess.
[68:10] So yeah,
[68:11] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[68:18] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[68:22] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[68:27] and specifically
[68:29] decoupling
[68:30] and the tests from the client.
[68:34] Right?
[68:35] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[68:41] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[68:47] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[68:52] compiling QT,
[68:55] all of this stuff.
[68:57] So just to get you know?
[69:00] And and there weren't binaries available
[69:04] for Solsea either.
[69:07] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[69:13] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[69:16] You have to do all of that.
[69:18] So I remember,
[69:20] you know, after all that decomposition,
[69:24] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[69:27] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[69:31] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[69:38] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[69:40] This is not great.
[69:42] It was my benefit.
[69:45] It's amazing.
[69:47] But, yeah,
[69:49] it was,
[69:51] yeah,
[69:53] it was a bit of a mess.
[69:56] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[70:00] you know, many times trying to build things,
[70:04] coming back,
[70:05] looking at it,
[70:07] saying, like, this can't be
[70:11] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[70:16] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[70:20] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[70:27] you know, but you're right.
[70:29] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[70:33] You know, talking about that,
[70:35] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[70:40] and everything.
[70:42] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[70:47] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[70:51] because that seems,
[70:53] you know, in an organized way.
[70:56] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[70:58] You know, you're the status quo.
[71:00] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[71:04] You know, things as simple as,
[71:06] like, like, you know, have we got,
[71:09] like, technical
[71:10] leads that actually lead?
[71:12] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[71:17] Have we got any IT ?
[71:19] Have we got
[71:21] anything?
[71:22] And it's like, no.
[71:24] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[71:28] And
[71:29] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[71:36] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[71:39] That was seen as a good thing,
[71:42] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[71:47] Right?
[71:48] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[71:53] Yeah.
[71:54] You know,
[71:56] I I
[71:57] alright.
[72:00] Okay.
[72:01] That's a it's a good strong point.
[72:04] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[72:08] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[72:13] but it was kind of similar.
[72:16] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[72:20] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[72:24] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[72:29] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[72:36] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[72:43] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[72:48] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[72:54] And but it's, I think,
[72:56] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[73:01] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[73:08] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[73:12] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[73:16] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[73:19] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[73:24] Yeah.
[73:25] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[73:28] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[73:33] I was finding these the other day.
[73:36] I was finding the first commits
[73:39] for PyEthereum,
[73:41] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[73:48] and Go Ethereum.
[73:51] And they were all
[73:52] I think they were all November or December.
[73:56] I think they were all 2013,
[74:00] not even 2014 for those three.
[74:03] Yeah.
[74:04] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[74:09] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[74:12] But, you know, that was
[74:14] Yeah.
[74:15] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[74:19] Right?
[74:20] Yeah.
[74:21] We were much later.
[74:23] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[74:26] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[74:28] Yeah.
[74:29] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[74:32] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[74:36] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[74:40] I got to know the project pretty well.
[74:43] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[74:47] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[74:51] September, October, something like that,
[74:56] and we started work more or less right away.
[75:01] More Jim than me.
[75:03] But so yeah,
[75:05] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[75:09] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[75:12] Yep.
[75:14] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[75:17] Right?
[75:18] I think probably
[75:20] they could have
[75:21] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[75:28] doing any hedging.
[75:31] And then later,
[75:34] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[75:40] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[75:45] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[75:51] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[75:56] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[76:01] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[76:08] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[76:14] get people to fight over it,
[76:17] but
[76:18] it it probably overcorrected,
[76:21] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[76:25] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[76:29] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[76:34] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[76:38] that was the whole world.
[76:40] Right?
[76:41] You know, that was everything,
[76:44] right, was several months
[76:49] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[76:54] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[77:00] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[77:01] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[77:03] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[77:08] sorry, 2013.
[77:12] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[77:16] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[77:21] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[77:28] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[77:33] going on.
[77:35] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[77:40] so just three further days.
[77:43] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[77:48] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[77:54] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[78:00] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[78:05] So,
[78:06] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[78:12] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[78:15] Oh,
[78:17] sorry.
[78:18] You
[78:19] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[78:24] Right?
[78:26] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[78:30] you had,
[78:31] you know, money for early contributors,
[78:36] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[78:39] Yeah.
[78:40] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[78:45] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[78:51] But
[78:52] then, yeah,
[78:53] following that,
[78:55] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[78:59] onto those teams.
[79:01] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[79:06] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[79:12] you know, that that never got funded.
[79:15] And then you
[79:17] and then you guys starting
[79:18] whenever you were starting.
[79:20] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[79:26] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[79:30] you know, when when that team spun out
[79:34] and you basically did have a major,
[79:38] you know,
[79:39] rapidly load-bearing client,
[79:42] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[79:46] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[79:50] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[79:55] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[80:00] And then it's like, right.
[80:03] Sorry.
[80:04] You're out,
[80:06] and you're not getting any money.
[80:09] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[80:11] Yes.
[80:12] Do you
[80:13] so my memory
[80:15] around the C++ client was that
[80:17] there were funds to
[80:19] do a security audit
[80:21] for
[80:22] two clients,
[80:23] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[80:28] Right?
[80:29] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[80:34] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[80:40] but I'm not quite sure.
[80:43] I'm not they sure did.
[80:47] You know?
[80:48] You know mean?
[80:49] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[80:52] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[81:00] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[81:06] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[81:12] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[81:19] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[81:26] mid 2015,
[81:27] it's like,
[81:29] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[81:34] And then
[81:35] that's what happened.
[81:36] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[81:39] I mean,
[81:40] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[81:47] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[81:53] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[81:56] But the Go client was more stable.
[82:00] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[82:05] it was often in an unstable situation.
[82:09] So even when C++ Ethereum
[82:13] as a client,
[82:14] like, died,
[82:16] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[82:22] It's like, right.
[82:24] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[82:30] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[82:37] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[82:41] across solc,
[82:43] the tests,
[82:44] and C++ Ethereum.
[82:46] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[82:57] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[83:02] but
[83:03] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[83:06] Right?
[83:07] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[83:11] He was he was building that client.
[83:15] He was writing the yellow paper.
[83:18] He was,
[83:20] you know, working there with Christian and
[83:23] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[83:27] You know, all of that was was there.
[83:32] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[83:36] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[83:40] Right?
[83:41] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[83:44] And and that that Geth team were working
[83:47] closer with Mist,
[83:50] you know, with on Mist.
[83:53] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[84:00] You know, it's like Yeah.
[84:02] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[84:05] But but, yeah,
[84:07] that would make sense.
[84:09] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[84:13] And and
[84:14] wait.
[84:16] So see the Solidity compiler.
[84:19] That was part of that C++ group too?
[84:22] Yeah.
[84:23] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[84:27] But yeah.
[84:28] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[84:31] Okay.
[84:32] I remember web three umbrella.
[84:35] I remember the web three umbrella.
[84:37] Yes.
[84:39] So, yeah,
[84:40] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[84:45] you know, for for f.
[84:47] It was called f.
[84:49] It was just called f the executable.
[84:53] So you'd have f and again,
[84:56] yeah, you had f.
[84:58] You had solc.
[85:00] You had
[85:01] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[85:04] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[85:06] Acute client.
[85:08] You had,
[85:09] which was the gooey miner.
[85:12] Yeah.
[85:13] That's right.
[85:14] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[85:21] And then you had one,
[85:23] which was sort of
[85:24] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[85:30] I can't remember the exact scope,
[85:32] but but it was sort of like, right.
[85:35] You're running a node,
[85:38] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[85:41] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[85:48] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[85:53] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[85:56] That's a lot.
[85:58] That that was a lot.
[86:00] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[86:07] Right?
[86:09] Right.
[86:10] Right.
[86:12] But then they were all really codependent.
[86:15] I mean, when I started,
[86:17] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[86:23] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[86:26] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[86:29] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[86:32] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[86:35] Yeah.
[86:37] Dev p two p.
[86:38] Live p two p.
[86:39] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[86:42] documentation all over the place.
[86:44] I mean You know?
[86:46] I think, you know,
[86:50] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[86:58] it's like, right.
[87:00] Let's try and make this modular.
[87:04] Right?
[87:05] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[87:12] But it was it was pulled apart
[87:17] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[87:24] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[87:28] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[87:32] There was no
[87:33] interplace discipline on any of it.
[87:36] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[87:40] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[87:45] So it's like, right.
[87:47] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[87:53] like, that wasn't atomic.
[87:56] It was it was just a big old mess.
[88:01] So yeah,
[88:02] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[88:09] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[88:13] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[88:18] and specifically
[88:19] decoupling
[88:20] and the tests from the client.
[88:24] Right?
[88:25] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[88:31] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[88:37] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[88:42] compiling QT,
[88:45] all of this stuff.
[88:47] So just to get you know?
[88:49] And and there weren't binaries available
[88:53] for Solsea either.
[88:56] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[89:02] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[89:04] You have to do all of that.
[89:06] So I remember,
[89:08] you know, after all that decomposition,
[89:12] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[89:15] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[89:19] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[89:26] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[89:28] This is not great.
[89:30] It was my benefit.
[89:33] It's amazing.
[89:35] But, yeah,
[89:37] it was,
[89:38] yeah,
[89:40] it was a bit of a mess.
[89:43] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[89:46] you know, many times trying to build things,
[89:50] coming back,
[89:51] looking at it,
[89:53] saying, like, this can't be
[89:57] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[90:02] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[90:06] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[90:13] you know, but you're right.
[90:15] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[90:20] You know, talking about that,
[90:22] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[90:26] and everything.
[90:28] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[90:33] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[90:37] because that seems,
[90:39] you know, in an organized way.
[90:42] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[90:44] You know, you're the status quo.
[90:46] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[90:50] You know, things as simple as,
[90:52] like, like, you know, have we got,
[90:55] like, technical
[90:56] leads that actually lead?
[90:58] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[91:04] Have we got any IT ?
[91:06] Have we got
[91:08] anything?
[91:09] And it's like, no.
[91:11] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[91:15] And
[91:16] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[91:24] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[91:27] That was seen as a good thing,
[91:30] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[91:35] Right?
[91:36] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[91:41] Yeah.
[91:42] You know,
[91:44] I I
[91:45] alright.
[91:47] Okay.
[91:48] That's a it's a good strong point.
[91:51] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[91:55] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[92:00] but it was kind of similar.
[92:03] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[92:07] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[92:11] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[92:16] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[92:23] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[92:30] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[92:35] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[92:41] And but it's, I think,
[92:43] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[92:48] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[92:55] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[93:00] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[93:06] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[93:09] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[93:14] Yeah.

[95:02] Yep.
[95:04] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[95:07] Right?
[95:08] I think probably
[95:10] they could have
[95:11] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[95:18] doing any hedging.
[95:21] And then later,
[95:24] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[95:30] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[95:35] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[95:41] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[95:46] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[95:51] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[96:00] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[96:06] get people to fight over it,
[96:09] but
[96:10] it it probably overcorrected,
[96:13] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

[96:53] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[96:58] sorry, 2013.
[97:02] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[97:07] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[97:12] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[97:18] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[97:23] going on.
[97:25] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[97:30] so just three further days.
[97:34] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[97:39] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[97:45] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[97:50] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[97:55] So,
[97:56] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[98:02] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[98:05] Oh,
[98:06] sorry.
[98:07] You
[98:08] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[98:13] Right?
[98:14] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[98:19] you had,
[98:20] you know, money for early contributors,
[98:25] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[98:28] Yeah.
[98:29] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[98:34] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[98:40] But
[98:41] then, yeah,
[98:42] following that,
[98:44] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[98:47] onto those teams.
[98:49] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[98:55] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[99:01] you know, that that never got funded.
[99:04] And then you
[99:06] and then you guys starting
[99:07] whenever you were starting.
[99:09] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[99:15] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[99:20] you know, when when that team spun out
[99:24] and you basically did have a major,
[99:28] you know,
[99:29] rapidly load-bearing client,
[99:32] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[99:36] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[99:40] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[99:45] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[99:50] And then it's like, right.
[99:53] Sorry.
[99:54] You're out,
[99:56] and you're not getting any money.
[100:00] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[100:02] Yes.
[100:03] Do you
[100:04] so my memory
[100:06] around the C++ client was that
[100:08] there were funds to
[100:10] do a security audit
[100:12] for
[100:13] two clients,
[100:14] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[100:19] Right?
[100:20] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[100:25] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[100:31] but I'm not quite sure.
[100:34] I'm not they sure did.
[100:38] You know?
[100:39] You know mean?
[100:40] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[100:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[100:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[100:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[100:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[101:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[101:11] mid 2015,
[101:12] it's like,
[101:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[101:19] And then
[101:20] that's what happened.
[101:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[101:24] I mean,
[101:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[101:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[101:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[101:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[101:45] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[101:50] it was often in an unstable situation.
[101:53] So even when C++ Ethereum
[101:57] as a client,
[101:58] like, died,
[102:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[102:06] It's like, right.
[102:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[102:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[102:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[102:26] across solc,
[102:28] the tests,
[102:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[102:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[102:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[102:48] but
[102:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[102:53] Right?
[102:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[102:58] He was he was building that client.
[103:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[103:05] He was,
[103:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[103:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[103:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[103:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[103:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[103:27] Right?
[103:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[103:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[103:34] closer with Mist,
[103:37] you know, with on Mist.
[103:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[103:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[103:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[103:51] But but, yeah,
[103:53] that would make sense.
[103:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[103:59] And and
[104:00] wait.
[104:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[104:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[104:08] Yeah.
[104:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[104:13] But yeah.
[104:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[104:17] Okay.
[104:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[104:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[104:22] Yes.
[104:23] So, yeah,
[104:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[104:30] you know, for for f.
[104:32] It was called f.
[104:34] It was just called f the executable.
[104:38] So you'd have f and again,
[104:40] yeah, you had f.
[104:42] You had solc.
[104:44] You had
[104:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[104:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[104:50] Acute client.
[104:52] You had,
[104:53] which was the gooey miner.
[104:56] Yeah.
[104:57] That's right.
[104:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[105:05] And then you had one,
[105:07] which was sort of
[105:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[105:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[105:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[105:20] You're running a node,
[105:23] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[105:26] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[105:33] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[105:40] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[105:42] That's a lot.
[105:44] That that was a lot.
[105:46] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[105:53] Right?
[105:55] Right.
[105:57] Right.
[105:58] Right.
[105:59] But then they were all really codependent.
[106:02] I mean, when I started,
[106:04] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[106:10] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[106:13] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[106:16] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[106:19] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[106:22] Yeah.
[106:24] Dev p two p.
[106:25] Live p two p.
[106:26] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[106:30] documentation all over the place.
[106:32] I mean You know?
[106:34] I think, you know,
[106:38] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[106:46] it's like, right.
[106:48] Let's try and make this modular.
[106:52] Right?
[106:53] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[107:00] But it was it was pulled apart
[107:05] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[107:12] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[107:16] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[107:20] There was no
[107:21] interplace discipline on any of it.
[107:25] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[107:28] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[107:33] So it's like, right.
[107:35] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[107:42] like, that wasn't atomic.
[107:44] It was it was just a big old mess.
[107:50] So yeah,
[107:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[107:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[108:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[108:07] and specifically
[108:09] decoupling
[108:10] and the tests from the client.
[108:14] Right?
[108:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[108:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[108:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[108:32] compiling QT,
[108:35] all of this stuff.
[108:37] So just to get you know?
[108:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[108:44] for Solsea either.
[108:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[108:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[108:56] You have to do all of that.
[108:58] So I remember,
[109:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[109:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[109:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[109:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[109:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[109:20] This is not great.
[109:22] It was my benefit.
[109:25] It's amazing.
[109:27] But, yeah,
[109:28] it was,
[109:30] yeah,
[109:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[109:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[109:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[109:41] coming back,
[109:42] looking at it,
[109:44] saying, like, this can't be
[109:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[109:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[109:57] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[110:04] you know, but you're right.
[110:06] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[110:10] You know, talking about that,
[110:12] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[110:17] and everything.
[110:19] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[110:24] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[110:28] because that seems,
[110:30] you know, in an organized way.
[110:33] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[110:35] You know, you're the status quo.
[110:37] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[110:41] You know, things as simple as,
[110:43] like, like, you know, have we got,
[110:46] like, technical
[110:47] leads that actually lead?
[110:49] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[110:54] Have we got any IT ?
[110:56] Have we got
[110:58] anything?
[110:59] And it's like, no.
[111:01] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[111:05] And
[111:06] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[111:13] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[111:16] That was seen as a good thing,
[111:19] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[111:24] Right?
[111:25] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[111:30] Yeah.
[111:31] You know,
[111:33] I I
[111:34] alright.
[111:37] Okay.
[111:38] That's a it's a good strong point.
[111:41] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[111:45] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[111:50] but it was kind of similar.
[111:53] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[111:57] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[112:01] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[112:06] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[112:13] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[112:20] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[112:25] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[112:31] And but it's, I think,
[112:33] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[112:38] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[112:45] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[112:50] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[112:56] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[112:59] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[113:04] Yeah.
[113:05] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[113:08] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[113:13] I was finding these the other day.
[113:16] I was finding the first commits
[113:19] for PyEthereum,
[113:21] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[113:28] and Go Ethereum.
[113:31] And they were all
[113:32] I think they were all November or December.
[113:36] I think they were all 2013,
[113:39] not even 2014 for those three.
[113:42] Yeah.
[113:43] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[113:48] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[113:51] But, you know, that was
[113:53] Yeah.
[113:54] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[113:58] Right?
[113:59] Yeah.
[114:00] We were much later.
[114:03] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[114:06] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[114:08] Yeah.
[114:09] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[114:12] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[114:16] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[114:20] I got to know the project pretty well.
[114:23] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[114:27] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[114:31] September, October, something like that,
[114:36] and we started work more or less right away.
[114:41] More Jim than me.
[114:43] But so yeah,
[114:45] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[114:49] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[114:52] Yep.
[114:54] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[114:57] Right?
[114:58] I think probably
[115:00] they could have
[115:01] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[115:08] doing any hedging.
[115:11] And then later,
[115:14] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[115:20] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[115:25] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[115:31] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[115:36] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[115:41] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[115:48] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[115:54] get people to fight over it,
[115:57] but
[115:58] it it probably overcorrected,
[116:01] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[116:05] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[116:09] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[116:14] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[116:18] that was the whole world.
[116:20] Right?
[116:21] You know, that was everything,
[116:24] right, was several months
[116:29] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[116:34] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[116:38] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[116:39] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[116:41] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[116:45] sorry, 2013.
[116:49] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[116:53] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[117:00] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[117:06] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[117:11] going on.
[117:13] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[117:18] so just three further days.
[117:21] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[117:26] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[117:32] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[117:38] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[117:43] So,
[117:44] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[117:50] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[117:53] Oh,
[117:54] sorry.
[117:55] You
[117:56] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[118:01] Right?
[118:02] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[118:07] you had,
[118:08] you know, money for early contributors,
[118:13] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[118:16] Yeah.
[118:17] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[118:22] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[118:28] But
[118:29] then, yeah,
[118:30] following that,
[118:32] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[118:35] onto those teams.
[118:37] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[118:42] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[118:48] you know, that that never got funded.
[118:51] And then you
[118:53] and then you guys starting
[118:54] whenever you were starting.
[118:56] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[119:02] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[119:07] you know, when when that team spun out
[119:11] and you basically did have a major,
[119:15] you know,
[119:16] rapidly load-bearing client,
[119:18] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[119:22] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[119:26] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[119:31] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[119:36] And then it's like, right.
[119:39] Sorry.
[119:40] You're out,
[119:42] and you're not getting any money.
[119:45] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[119:47] Yes.
[119:48] Do you
[119:49] so my memory
[119:51] around the C++ client was that
[119:53] there were funds to
[119:55] do a security audit
[119:57] for
[119:58] two clients,
[119:59] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[120:04] Right?
[120:06] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[120:11] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[120:17] but I'm not quite sure.
[120:20] I'm not they sure did.
[120:24] You know?
[120:25] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[120:28] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[120:32] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[120:37] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[120:43] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[120:50] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[120:57] mid 2015,
[120:58] it's like,
[121:00] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[121:05] And then
[121:06] that's what happened.
[121:07] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[121:10] I mean,
[121:11] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[121:18] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[121:24] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[121:27] But the Go client was more stable.
[121:30] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[121:35] it was often in an unstable situation.
[121:38] So even when C++ Ethereum
[121:42] as a client,
[121:43] like, died,
[121:45] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[121:51] It's like, right.
[121:53] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[121:59] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[122:06] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[122:10] across solc,
[122:12] the tests,
[122:13] and C++ Ethereum.
[122:15] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[122:26] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[122:32] but
[122:33] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[122:37] Right?
[122:38] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[122:42] He was he was building that client.
[122:46] He was writing the yellow paper.
[122:49] He was,
[122:51] you know, working there with Christian and
[122:54] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[122:58] You know, all of that was was there.
[123:03] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[123:07] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[123:11] Right?
[123:12] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[123:15] And and that that Geth team were working
[123:18] closer with Mist,
[123:21] you know, with on Mist.
[123:24] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[123:30] You know, it's like Yeah.
[123:32] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[123:35] But but, yeah,
[123:37] that would make sense.
[123:39] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[123:43] And and
[123:44] wait.
[123:46] So see the Solidity compiler.
[123:49] That was part of that C++ group too?
[123:52] Yeah.
[123:53] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[123:57] But yeah.
[123:58] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[124:01] Okay.
[124:02] I remember web three umbrella.
[124:05] I remember the web three umbrella.
[124:07] Yes.
[124:09] So, yeah,
[124:10] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[124:15] you know, for for f.
[124:17] It was called f.
[124:19] It was just called f the executable.
[124:23] So you'd have f and again,
[124:26] yeah, you had f.
[124:28] You had solc.
[124:30] You had
[124:31] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[124:34] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[124:36] Acute client.
[124:38] You had,
[124:39] which was the gooey miner.
[124:42] Yeah.
[124:43] That's right.
[124:44] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[124:51] And then you had one,
[124:53] which was sort of
[124:54] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[125:00] I can't remember the exact scope,
[125:02] but but it was sort of like, right.
[125:05] You're running a node,
[125:08] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[125:11] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[125:18] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[125:24] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[125:26] That's a lot.
[125:28] That that was a lot.
[125:30] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[125:37] Right?
[125:39] Right.
[125:40] Right.
[125:41] But then they were all really codependent.
[125:44] I mean, when I started,
[125:46] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[125:52] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[125:55] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[125:58] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[126:01] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[126:04] Yeah.
[126:06] Dev p two p.
[126:07] Live p two p.
[126:08] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[126:12] documentation all over the place.
[126:14] I mean You know?
[126:16] I think, you know,
[126:20] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[126:28] it's like, right.
[126:30] Let's try and make this modular.
[126:34] Right?
[126:35] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[126:42] But it was it was pulled apart
[126:47] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[126:54] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[126:58] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[127:02] There was no
[127:03] interplace discipline on any of it.
[127:06] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[127:10] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[127:15] So it's like, right.
[127:17] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[127:24] like, that wasn't atomic.
[127:26] It was it was just a big old mess.
[127:32] So yeah,
[127:33] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[127:40] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[127:44] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[127:49] and specifically
[127:51] decoupling
[127:52] and the tests from the client.
[127:56] Right?
[127:57] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[128:03] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[128:09] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[128:14] compiling QT,
[128:17] all of this stuff.
[128:19] So just to get you know?
[128:22] And and there weren't binaries available
[128:26] for Solsea either.
[128:29] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[128:35] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[128:37] You have to do all of that.
[128:39] So I remember,
[128:41] you know, after all that decomposition,
[128:45] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[128:48] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[128:52] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[129:00] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[129:02] This is not great.
[129:04] It was my benefit.
[129:07] It's amazing.
[129:09] But, yeah,
[129:11] it was,
[129:13] yeah,
[129:15] it was a bit of a mess.
[129:18] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[129:21] you know, many times trying to build things,
[129:25] coming back,
[129:26] looking at it,
[129:28] saying, like, this can't be
[129:32] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[129:37] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[129:41] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[129:48] you know, but you're right.
[129:50] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[129:55] You know, talking about that,
[130:00] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[130:05] and everything.
[130:07] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[130:12] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[130:16] because that seems,
[130:18] you know, in an organized way.
[130:21] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[130:23] You know, you're the status quo.
[130:25] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[130:29] You know, things as simple as,
[130:31] like, like, you know, have we got,
[130:34] like, technical
[130:35] leads that actually lead?
[130:37] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[130:42] Have we got any IT ?
[130:44] Have we got
[130:46] anything?
[130:47] And it's like, no.
[130:49] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[130:53] And
[130:54] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[131:02] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[131:05] That was seen as a good thing,
[131:08] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[131:13] Right?
[131:14] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[131:20] Yeah.
[131:21] You know,
[131:23] I I
[131:24] alright.
[131:27] Okay.
[131:28] That's a it's a good strong point.
[131:31] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[131:35] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[131:40] but it was kind of similar.
[131:43] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[131:47] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[131:52] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[131:57] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[132:04] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[132:11] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[132:16] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[132:22] And but it's, I think,
[132:24] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[132:29] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[132:36] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[132:41] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[132:46] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[132:49] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[132:54] Yeah.
[132:55] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[132:58] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[133:03] I was finding these the other day.
[133:06] I was finding the first commits
[133:09] for PyEthereum,
[133:11] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[133:18] and Go Ethereum.
[133:21] And they were all
[133:22] I think they were all November or December.
[133:26] I think they were all 2013,
[133:29] not even 2014 for those three.
[133:32] Yeah.
[133:33] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[133:38] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[133:41] But, you know, that was
[133:43] Yeah.
[133:44] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[133:48] Right?
[133:49] Yeah.
[133:50] We were much later.
[133:53] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[133:56] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[133:58] Yeah.
[133:59] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[134:02] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[134:06] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[134:10] I got to know the project pretty well.
[134:13] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[134:17] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[134:21] September, October, something like that,
[134:26] and we started work more or less right away.
[134:31] More Jim than me.
[134:33] But so yeah,
[134:35] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[134:39] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[134:42] Yep.
[134:44] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[134:47] Right?
[134:48] I think probably
[134:50] they could have
[134:51] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[134:58] doing any hedging.
[135:01] And then later,
[135:04] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[135:10] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[135:15] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[135:21] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[135:26] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[135:31] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[135:40] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[135:46] get people to fight over it,
[135:49] but
[135:50] it it probably overcorrected,
[135:53] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[135:57] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[136:01] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[136:06] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[136:10] that was the whole world.
[136:12] Right?
[136:13] You know, that was everything,
[136:16] right, was several months
[136:21] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[136:26] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[136:30] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[136:31] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[136:33] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[136:38] sorry, 2013.
[136:42] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[136:47] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[136:52] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[136:58] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[137:03] going on.
[137:05] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[137:10] so just three further days.
[137:14] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[137:19] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[137:25] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[137:30] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[137:35] So,
[137:36] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[137:42] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[137:45] Oh,
[137:46] sorry.
[137:47] You
[137:48] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[137:53] Right?
[137:54] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[137:59] you had,
[138:00] you know, money for early contributors,
[138:05] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[138:08] Yeah.
[138:09] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[138:14] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[138:20] But
[138:21] then, yeah,
[138:22] following that,
[138:24] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[138:27] onto those teams.
[138:29] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[138:35] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[138:41] you know, that that never got funded.
[138:44] And then you
[138:46] and then you guys starting
[138:47] whenever you were starting.
[138:49] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[138:55] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[139:00] you know, when when that team spun out
[139:04] and you basically did have a major,
[139:08] you know,
[139:09] rapidly load-bearing client,
[139:12] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[139:16] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[139:20] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[139:25] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[139:30] And then it's like, right.
[139:33] Sorry.
[139:34] You're out,
[139:36] and you're not getting any money.
[139:39] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[139:41] Yes.
[139:42] Do you
[139:43] so my memory
[139:45] around the C++ client was that
[139:47] there were funds to
[139:49] do a security audit
[139:51] for
[139:52] two clients,
[139:53] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[139:58] Right?
[140:00] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[140:05] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[140:11] but I'm not quite sure.
[140:14] I'm not they sure did.
[140:18] You know?
[140:19] You know mean?
[140:20] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[140:23] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[140:27] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[140:32] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[140:38] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[140:45] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[140:52] mid 2015,
[140:53] it's like,
[140:55] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[141:00] And then
[141:01] that's what happened.
[141:02] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[141:05] I mean,
[141:06] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[141:13] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[141:19] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[141:22] But the Go client was more stable.
[141:25] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[141:30] it was often in an unstable situation.
[141:33] So even when C++ Ethereum
[141:37] as a client,
[141:38] like, died,
[141:40] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[141:46] It's like, right.
[141:48] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[141:54] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[142:01] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[142:06] across solc,
[142:08] the tests,
[142:09] and C++ Ethereum.
[142:11] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[142:22] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[142:28] but
[142:29] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[142:33] Right?
[142:34] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[142:38] He was he was building that client.
[142:42] He was writing the yellow paper.
[142:45] He was,
[142:47] you know, working there with Christian and
[142:50] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[142:54] You know, all of that was was there.
[143:00] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[143:04] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[143:08] Right?
[143:09] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[143:12] And and that that Geth team were working
[143:15] closer with Mist,
[143:18] you know, with on Mist.
[143:21] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[143:27] You know, it's like Yeah.
[143:29] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[143:32] But but, yeah,
[143:34] that would make sense.
[143:36] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[143:40] And and
[143:41] wait.
[143:43] So see the Solidity compiler.
[143:46] That was part of that C++ group too?
[143:49] Yeah.
[143:50] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[143:54] But yeah.
[143:55] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[143:58] Okay.
[143:59] I remember web three umbrella.
[144:01] I remember the web three umbrella.
[144:03] Yes.
[144:05] So, yeah,
[144:06] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[144:11] you know, for for f.
[144:13] It was called f.
[144:15] It was just called f the executable.
[144:19] So you'd have f and again,
[144:21] yeah, you had f.
[144:23] You had solc.
[144:25] You had
[144:26] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[144:29] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[144:31] Acute client.
[144:33] You had,
[144:34] which was the gooey miner.
[144:37] Yeah.
[144:38] That's right.
[144:39] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[144:46] And then you had one,
[144:48] which was sort of
[144:49] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[144:55] I can't remember the exact scope,
[144:57] but but it was sort of like, right.
[145:00] You're running a node,
[145:03] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[145:06] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[145:13] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[145:20] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[145:22] That's a lot.
[145:24] That that was a lot.
[145:26] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[145:33] Right?
[145:35] Right.
[145:37] Right.
[145:38] Right.
[145:39] But then they were all really codependent.
[145:42] I mean, when I started,
[145:44] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[145:50] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[145:53] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[145:56] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[145:59] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[146:02] Yeah.
[146:03] Dev p two p.
[146:04] Live p two p.
[146:05] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[146:10] documentation all over the place.
[146:12] I mean You know?
[146:14] I think, you know,
[146:18] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[146:26] it's like, right.
[146:28] Let's try and make this modular.
[146:32] Right?
[146:33] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[146:40] But it was it was pulled apart
[146:45] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[146:52] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[146:56] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[147:00] There was no
[147:01] interplace discipline on any of it.
[147:04] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[147:08] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[147:13] So it's like, right.
[147:15] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[147:22] like, that wasn't atomic.
[147:24] It was it was just a big old mess.
[147:30] So yeah,
[147:31] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[147:38] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[147:42] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[147:47] and specifically
[147:49] decoupling
[147:50] and the tests from the client.
[148:03] Right?
[148:04] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[148:10] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[148:16] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[148:21] compiling QT,
[148:24] all of this stuff.
[148:26] So just to get you know?
[148:29] And and there weren't binaries available
[148:33] for Solsea either.
[148:36] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[148:42] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[148:45] You have to do all of that.
[148:47] So I remember,
[148:49] you know, after all that decomposition,
[148:53] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[148:56] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[149:00] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[149:07] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[149:09] This is not great.
[149:11] It was my benefit.
[149:14] It's amazing.
[149:16] But, yeah,
[149:17] it was,
[149:19] yeah,
[149:20] it was a bit of a mess.
[149:23] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[149:26] you know, many times trying to build things,
[149:30] coming back,
[149:31] looking at it,
[149:33] saying, like, this can't be
[149:37] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[149:42] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[149:46] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[150:03] you know, but you're right.
[150:05] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[150:10] You know, talking about that,
[150:12] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[150:17] and everything.
[150:19] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[150:24] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[150:28] because that seems,
[150:30] you know, in an organized way.
[150:33] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[150:35] You know, you're the status quo.
[150:37] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[150:41] You know, things as simple as,
[150:43] like, like, you know, have we got,
[150:46] like, technical
[150:47] leads that actually lead?
[150:49] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[150:54] Have we got any IT ?
[150:56] Have we got
[150:58] anything?
[150:59] And it's like, no.
[151:01] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[151:05] And
[151:06] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[151:14] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[151:17] That was seen as a good thing,
[151:20] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[151:25] Right?
[151:26] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[151:31] Yeah.
[151:32] You know,
[151:34] I I
[151:35] alright.
[151:38] Okay.
[151:39] That's a it's a good strong point.
[151:42] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[151:46] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[151:51] but it was kind of similar.
[151:54] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[151:58] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[152:03] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[152:08] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[152:15] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[152:22] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[152:27] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[152:33] And but it's, I think,
[152:35] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[152:40] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[152:47] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[152:52] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[152:58] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[153:01] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[153:06] Yeah.
[153:07] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[153:10] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[153:15] I was finding these the other day.
[153:18] I was finding the first commits
[153:21] for PyEthereum,
[153:23] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[153:30] and Go Ethereum.
[153:33] And they were all
[153:34] I think they were all November or December.
[153:38] I think they were all 2013,
[153:41] not even 2014 for those three.
[153:44] Yeah.
[153:45] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[153:50] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[153:53] But, you know, that was
[153:55] Yeah.
[153:56] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[154:00] Right?
[154:01] Yeah.
[154:02] We were much later.
[154:05] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[154:08] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[154:10] Yeah.
[154:11] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[154:14] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[154:18] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[154:22] I got to know the project pretty well.
[154:25] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[154:29] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[154:33] September, October, something like that,
[154:38] and we started work more or less right away.
[154:43] More Jim than me.
[154:45] But so yeah,
[154:47] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[154:51] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[154:54] Yep.
[154:56] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[154:59] Right?
[155:00] I think probably
[155:02] they could have
[155:03] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[155:10] doing any hedging.
[155:13] And then later,
[155:16] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[155:22] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[155:27] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[155:33] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[155:38] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[155:43] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[155:52] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[156:00] get people to fight over it,
[156:03] but
[156:04] it it probably overcorrected,
[156:07] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[156:12] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[156:16] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[156:21] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[156:25] that was the whole world.
[156:27] Right?
[156:28] You know, that was everything,
[156:31] right, was several months
[156:36] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[156:41] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[156:45] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[156:46] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[156:48] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[156:52] sorry, 2013.
[156:56] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[157:01] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[157:06] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[157:11] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[157:16] going on.
[157:18] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[157:23] so just three further days.
[157:27] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[157:32] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[157:38] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[157:43] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[157:48] So,
[157:49] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[157:55] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[158:02] Oh,
[158:03] sorry.
[158:04] You
[158:05] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[158:10] Right?
[158:11] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[158:16] you had,
[158:17] you know, money for early contributors,
[158:22] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[158:25] Yeah.
[158:26] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[158:31] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[158:37] But
[158:38] then, yeah,
[158:40] following that,
[158:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[158:45] onto those teams.
[158:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[158:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[159:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[159:03] And then you
[159:05] and then you guys starting
[159:06] whenever you were starting.
[159:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[159:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[159:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[159:23] and you basically did have a major,
[159:27] you know,
[159:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[159:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[159:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[159:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[159:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[159:48] And then it's like, right.
[159:51] Sorry.
[159:52] You're out,
[159:54] and you're not getting any money.
[159:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[160:00] Yes.
[160:01] Do you
[160:02] so my memory
[160:04] around the C++ client was that
[160:06] there were funds to
[160:08] do a security audit
[160:10] for
[160:11] two clients,
[160:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[160:17] Right?
[160:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[160:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[160:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[160:33] I'm not they sure did.
[160:37] You know?
[160:38] You know mean?
[160:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[160:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[160:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[160:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[160:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[161:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[161:11] mid 2015,
[161:12] it's like,
[161:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[161:19] And then
[161:20] that's what happened.
[161:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[161:24] I mean,
[161:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[161:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[161:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[161:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[161:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[161:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[161:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[161:56] as a client,
[161:57] like, died,
[162:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[162:06] It's like, right.
[162:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[162:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[162:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[162:26] across solc,
[162:28] the tests,
[162:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[162:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[162:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[162:48] but
[162:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[162:53] Right?
[162:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[162:58] He was he was building that client.
[163:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[163:05] He was,
[163:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[163:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[163:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[163:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[163:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[163:27] Right?
[163:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[163:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[163:34] closer with Mist,
[163:37] you know, with on Mist.
[163:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[163:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[163:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[163:51] But but, yeah,
[163:53] that would make sense.
[163:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[163:59] And and
[164:00] wait.
[164:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[164:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[164:08] Yeah.
[164:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[164:13] But yeah.
[164:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[164:17] Okay.
[164:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[164:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[164:22] Yes.
[164:23] So, yeah,
[164:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[164:30] you know, for for f.
[164:32] It was called f.
[164:34] It was just called f the executable.
[164:38] So you'd have f and again,
[164:40] yeah, you had f.
[164:42] You had solc.
[164:44] You had
[164:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[164:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[164:50] Acute client.
[164:52] You had,
[164:53] which was the gooey miner.
[164:56] Yeah.
[164:57] That's right.
[164:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[165:05] And then you had one,
[165:07] which was sort of
[165:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[165:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[165:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[165:19] You're running a node,
[165:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[165:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[165:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[165:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[165:41] That's a lot.
[165:43] That that was a lot.
[165:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[165:52] Right?
[165:54] Right.
[165:55] Right.
[165:56] Right.
[165:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[166:00] I mean, when I started,
[166:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[166:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[166:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[166:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[166:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[166:20] Yeah.
[166:22] Dev p two p.
[166:23] Live p two p.
[166:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[166:29] documentation all over the place.
[166:31] I mean You know?
[166:33] I think, you know,
[166:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[166:45] it's like, right.
[166:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[166:51] Right?
[166:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[166:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[167:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[167:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[167:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[167:19] There was no
[167:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[167:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[167:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[167:32] So it's like, right.
[167:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[167:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[167:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[167:50] So yeah,
[167:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[167:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[168:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[168:07] and specifically
[168:09] decoupling
[168:10] and the tests from the client.
[168:14] Right?
[168:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[168:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[168:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[168:32] compiling QT,
[168:35] all of this stuff.
[168:37] So just to get you know?
[168:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[168:44] for Solsea either.
[168:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[168:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[168:55] You have to do all of that.
[168:57] So I remember,
[169:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[169:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[169:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[169:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[169:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[169:20] This is not great.
[169:22] It was my benefit.
[169:25] It's amazing.
[169:27] But, yeah,
[169:28] it was,
[169:30] yeah,
[169:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[169:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[169:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[169:41] coming back,
[169:42] looking at it,
[169:44] saying, like, this can't be
[169:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[169:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[170:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[170:07] you know, but you're right.
[170:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[170:14] You know, talking about that,
[170:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[170:21] and everything.
[170:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[170:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[170:32] because that seems,
[170:34] you know, in an organized way.
[170:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[170:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[170:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[170:45] You know, things as simple as,
[170:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[170:50] like, technical
[170:51] leads that actually lead?
[170:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[170:58] Have we got any IT ?
[171:00] Have we got
[171:02] anything?
[171:03] And it's like, no.
[171:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[171:09] And
[171:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[171:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[171:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[171:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[171:29] Right?
[171:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[171:35] Yeah.
[171:36] You know,
[171:38] I I
[171:39] alright.
[171:42] Okay.
[171:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[171:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[171:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[171:55] but it was kind of similar.
[171:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[172:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[172:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[172:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[172:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[172:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[172:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[172:37] And but it's, I think,
[172:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[172:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[172:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[172:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[173:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[173:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[173:09] Yeah.
[173:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[173:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[173:18] I was finding these the other day.
[173:21] I was finding the first commits
[173:24] for PyEthereum,
[173:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[173:33] and Go Ethereum.
[173:36] And they were all
[173:37] I think they were all November or December.
[173:41] I think they were all 2013,
[173:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[173:47] Yeah.
[173:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[173:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[173:56] But, you know, that was
[173:58] Yeah.
[173:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[174:03] Right?
[174:04] Yeah.
[174:05] We were much later.
[174:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[174:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[174:13] Yeah.
[174:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[174:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[174:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[174:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[174:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[174:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[174:36] September, October, something like that,
[174:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[174:46] More Jim than me.
[174:48] But so yeah,
[174:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[174:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[174:57] Yep.
[175:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[175:03] Right?
[175:04] I think probably
[175:06] they could have
[175:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[175:14] doing any hedging.
[175:17] And then later,
[175:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[175:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[175:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[175:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[175:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[175:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[175:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[176:03] get people to fight over it,
[176:06] but
[176:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[176:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[176:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[176:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[176:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[176:28] that was the whole world.
[176:30] Right?
[176:31] You know, that was everything,
[176:34] right, was several months
[176:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[176:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[176:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[176:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[176:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[176:55] sorry, 2013.
[177:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[177:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[177:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[177:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[177:20] going on.
[177:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[177:27] so just three further days.
[177:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[177:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[177:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[177:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[177:52] So,
[177:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[178:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[178:03] Oh,
[178:04] sorry.
[178:05] You
[178:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[178:11] Right?
[178:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[178:17] you had,
[178:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[178:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[178:26] Yeah.
[178:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[178:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[178:38] But
[178:39] then, yeah,
[178:40] following that,
[178:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[178:45] onto those teams.
[178:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[178:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[179:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[179:03] And then you
[179:05] and then you guys starting
[179:06] whenever you were starting.
[179:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[179:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[179:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[179:23] and you basically did have a major,
[179:27] you know,
[179:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[179:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[179:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[179:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[179:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[179:48] And then it's like, right.
[179:51] Sorry.
[179:52] You're out,
[179:54] and you're not getting any money.
[179:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[180:00] Yes.
[180:01] Do you
[180:02] so my memory
[180:04] around the C++ client was that
[180:06] there were funds to
[180:08] do a security audit
[180:10] for
[180:11] two clients,
[180:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[180:17] Right?
[180:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[180:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[180:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[180:33] I'm not they sure did.
[180:37] You know?
[180:38] You know mean?
[180:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[180:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[180:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[180:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[180:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[181:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[181:11] mid 2015,
[181:12] it's like,
[181:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[181:19] And then
[181:20] that's what happened.
[181:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[181:24] I mean,
[181:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[181:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[181:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[181:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[181:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[181:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[181:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[181:56] as a client,
[181:57] like, died,
[182:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[182:06] It's like, right.
[182:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[182:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[182:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[182:26] across solc,
[182:28] the tests,
[182:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[182:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[182:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[182:48] but
[182:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[182:53] Right?
[182:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[182:58] He was he was building that client.
[183:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[183:05] He was,
[183:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[183:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[183:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[183:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[183:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[183:27] Right?
[183:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[183:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[183:34] closer with Mist,
[183:37] you know, with on Mist.
[183:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[183:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[183:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[183:51] But but, yeah,
[183:53] that would make sense.
[183:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[183:59] And and
[184:00] wait.
[184:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[184:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[184:08] Yeah.
[184:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[184:13] But yeah.
[184:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[184:17] Okay.
[184:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[184:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[184:22] Yes.
[184:23] So, yeah,
[184:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[184:30] you know, for for f.
[184:32] It was called f.
[184:34] It was just called f the executable.
[184:38] So you'd have f and again,
[184:40] yeah, you had f.
[184:42] You had solc.
[184:44] You had
[184:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[184:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[184:50] Acute client.
[184:52] You had,
[184:53] which was the gooey miner.
[184:56] Yeah.
[184:57] That's right.
[184:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[185:05] And then you had one,
[185:07] which was sort of
[185:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[185:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[185:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[185:19] You're running a node,
[185:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[185:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[185:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[185:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[185:41] That's a lot.
[185:43] That that was a lot.
[185:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[185:52] Right?
[185:54] Right.
[185:55] Right.
[185:56] Right.
[185:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[186:00] I mean, when I started,
[186:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[186:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[186:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[186:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[186:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[186:20] Yeah.
[186:22] Dev p two p.
[186:23] Live p two p.
[186:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[186:29] documentation all over the place.
[186:31] I mean You know?
[186:33] I think, you know,
[186:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[186:45] it's like, right.
[186:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[186:51] Right?
[186:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[186:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[187:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[187:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[187:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[187:19] There was no
[187:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[187:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[187:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[187:32] So it's like, right.
[187:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[187:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[187:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[187:50] So yeah,
[187:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[187:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[188:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[188:07] and specifically
[188:09] decoupling
[188:10] and the tests from the client.
[188:14] Right?
[188:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[188:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[188:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[188:32] compiling QT,
[188:35] all of this stuff.
[188:37] So just to get you know?
[188:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[188:44] for Solsea either.
[188:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[188:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[188:55] You have to do all of that.
[188:57] So I remember,
[189:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[189:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[189:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[189:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[189:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[189:20] This is not great.
[189:22] It was my benefit.
[189:25] It's amazing.
[189:27] But, yeah,
[189:28] it was,
[189:30] yeah,
[189:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[189:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[189:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[189:41] coming back,
[189:42] looking at it,
[189:44] saying, like, this can't be
[189:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[189:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[190:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[190:07] you know, but you're right.
[190:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[190:14] You know, talking about that,
[190:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[190:21] and everything.
[190:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[190:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[190:32] because that seems,
[190:34] you know, in an organized way.
[190:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[190:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[190:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[190:45] You know, things as simple as,
[190:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[190:50] like, technical
[190:51] leads that actually lead?
[190:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[190:58] Have we got any IT ?
[191:00] Have we got
[191:02] anything?
[191:03] And it's like, no.
[191:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[191:09] And
[191:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[191:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[191:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[191:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[191:29] Right?
[191:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[191:35] Yeah.
[191:36] You know,
[191:38] I I
[191:39] alright.
[191:42] Okay.
[191:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[191:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[191:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[191:55] but it was kind of similar.
[191:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[192:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[192:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[192:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[192:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[192:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[192:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[192:37] And but it's, I think,
[192:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[192:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[192:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[192:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[193:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[193:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[193:09] Yeah.
[193:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[193:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[193:18] I was finding these the other day.
[193:21] I was finding the first commits
[193:24] for PyEthereum,
[193:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[193:33] and Go Ethereum.
[193:36] And they were all
[193:37] I think they were all November or December.
[193:41] I think they were all 2013,
[193:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[193:47] Yeah.
[193:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[193:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[193:56] But, you know, that was
[193:58] Yeah.
[193:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[194:03] Right?
[194:04] Yeah.
[194:05] We were much later.
[194:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[194:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[194:13] Yeah.
[194:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[194:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[194:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[194:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[194:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[194:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[194:36] September, October, something like that,
[194:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[194:46] More Jim than me.
[194:48] But so yeah,
[194:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[194:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[194:57] Yep.
[195:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[195:03] Right?
[195:04] I think probably
[195:06] they could have
[195:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[195:14] doing any hedging.
[195:17] And then later,
[195:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[195:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[195:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[195:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[195:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[195:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[195:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[196:03] get people to fight over it,
[196:06] but
[196:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[196:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[196:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[196:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[196:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[196:28] that was the whole world.
[196:30] Right?
[196:31] You know, that was everything,
[196:34] right, was several months
[196:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[196:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[196:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[196:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[196:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[196:55] sorry, 2013.
[197:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[197:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[197:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[197:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[197:20] going on.
[197:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[197:27] so just three further days.
[197:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[197:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[197:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[197:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[197:52] So,
[197:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[198:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[198:03] Oh,
[198:04] sorry.
[198:05] You
[198:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[198:11] Right?
[198:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[198:17] you had,
[198:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[198:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[198:26] Yeah.
[198:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[198:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[198:38] But
[198:39] then, yeah,
[198:40] following that,
[198:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[198:45] onto those teams.
[198:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[198:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[198:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[199:02] And then you
[199:04] and then you guys starting
[199:05] whenever you were starting.
[199:07] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[199:13] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[199:18] you know, when when that team spun out
[199:22] and you basically did have a major,
[199:26] you know,
[199:27] rapidly load-bearing client,
[199:29] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[199:33] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[199:37] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[199:42] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[199:47] And then it's like, right.
[199:50] Sorry.
[199:51] You're out,
[199:53] and you're not getting any money.
[199:56] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[200:00] Yes.
[200:01] Do you
[200:02] so my memory
[200:04] around the C++ client was that
[200:06] there were funds to
[200:08] do a security audit
[200:10] for
[200:11] two clients,
[200:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[200:17] Right?
[200:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[200:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[200:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[200:33] I'm not they sure did.
[200:37] You know?
[200:38] You know mean?
[200:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[200:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[200:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[200:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[200:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[201:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[201:11] mid 2015,
[201:12] it's like,
[201:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[201:19] And then
[201:20] that's what happened.
[201:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[201:24] I mean,
[201:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[201:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[201:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[201:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[201:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[201:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[201:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[201:56] as a client,
[201:57] like, died,
[202:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[202:06] It's like, right.
[202:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[202:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[202:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[202:26] across solc,
[202:28] the tests,
[202:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[202:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[202:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[202:48] but
[202:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[202:53] Right?
[202:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[202:58] He was he was building that client.
[203:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[203:05] He was,
[203:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[203:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[203:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[203:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[203:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[203:27] Right?
[203:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[203:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[203:34] closer with Mist,
[203:37] you know, with on Mist.
[203:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[203:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[203:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[203:51] But but, yeah,
[203:53] that would make sense.
[203:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[203:59] And and
[204:00] wait.
[204:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[204:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[204:08] Yeah.
[204:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[204:13] But yeah.
[204:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[204:17] Okay.
[204:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[204:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[204:22] Yes.
[204:23] So, yeah,
[204:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[204:30] you know, for for f.
[204:32] It was called f.
[204:34] It was just called f the executable.
[204:38] So you'd have f and again,
[204:40] yeah, you had f.
[204:42] You had solc.
[204:44] You had
[204:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[204:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[204:50] Acute client.
[204:52] You had,
[204:53] which was the gooey miner.
[204:56] Yeah.
[204:57] That's right.
[204:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[205:05] And then you had one,
[205:07] which was sort of
[205:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[205:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[205:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[205:19] You're running a node,
[205:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[205:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[205:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[205:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[205:41] That's a lot.
[205:43] That that was a lot.
[205:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[205:52] Right?
[205:54] Right.
[205:55] Right.
[205:56] Right.
[205:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[206:00] I mean, when I started,
[206:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[206:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[206:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[206:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[206:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[206:20] Yeah.
[206:22] Dev p two p.
[206:23] Live p two p.
[206:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[206:29] documentation all over the place.
[206:31] I mean You know?
[206:33] I think, you know,
[206:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[206:45] it's like, right.
[206:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[206:51] Right?
[206:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[206:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[207:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[207:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[207:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[207:19] There was no
[207:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[207:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[207:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[207:32] So it's like, right.
[207:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[207:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[207:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[207:50] So yeah,
[207:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[207:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[208:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[208:07] and specifically
[208:09] decoupling
[208:10] and the tests from the client.
[208:14] Right?
[208:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[208:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[208:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[208:32] compiling QT,
[208:35] all of this stuff.
[208:37] So just to get you know?
[208:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[208:44] for Solsea either.
[208:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[208:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[208:55] You have to do all of that.
[208:57] So I remember,
[209:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[209:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[209:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[209:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[209:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[209:20] This is not great.
[209:22] It was my benefit.
[209:25] It's amazing.
[209:27] But, yeah,
[209:28] it was,
[209:30] yeah,
[209:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[209:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[209:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[209:41] coming back,
[209:42] looking at it,
[209:44] saying, like, this can't be
[209:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[209:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[210:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[210:07] you know, but you're right.
[210:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[210:14] You know, talking about that,
[210:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[210:21] and everything.
[210:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[210:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[210:32] because that seems,
[210:34] you know, in an organized way.
[210:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[210:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[210:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[210:45] You know, things as simple as,
[210:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[210:50] like, technical
[210:51] leads that actually lead?
[210:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[210:58] Have we got any IT ?
[211:00] Have we got
[211:02] anything?
[211:03] And it's like, no.
[211:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[211:09] And
[211:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[211:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[211:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[211:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[211:29] Right?
[211:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[211:35] Yeah.
[211:36] You know,
[211:38] I I
[211:39] alright.
[211:42] Okay.
[211:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[211:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[211:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[211:55] but it was kind of similar.

[215:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[215:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[216:03] get people to fight over it,
[216:06] but
[216:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[216:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[216:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[216:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[216:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[216:28] that was the whole world.
[216:30] Right?
[216:31] You know, that was everything,
[216:34] right, was several months
[216:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[216:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[216:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[216:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[216:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[216:55] sorry, 2013.
[217:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[217:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[217:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[217:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[217:20] going on.
[217:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[217:27] so just three further days.
[217:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[217:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[217:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[217:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[217:52] So,
[217:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[218:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[218:03] Oh,
[218:04] sorry.
[218:05] You
[218:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[218:11] Right?
[218:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[218:17] you had,
[218:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[218:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[218:26] Yeah.
[218:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[218:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[218:38] But
[218:39] then, yeah,
[218:40] following that,
[218:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[218:45] onto those teams.
[218:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[218:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[219:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[219:03] And then you
[219:05] and then you guys starting
[219:06] whenever you were starting.
[219:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[219:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[219:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[219:23] and you basically did have a major,
[219:27] you know,
[219:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[219:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[219:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[219:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[219:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[219:48] And then it's like, right.
[219:51] Sorry.
[219:52] You're out,
[219:54] and you're not getting any money.
[219:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[220:00] Yes.
[220:01] Do you
[220:02] so my memory
[220:04] around the C++ client was that
[220:06] there were funds to
[220:08] do a security audit
[220:10] for
[220:11] two clients,
[220:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[220:17] Right?
[220:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[220:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[220:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[220:33] I'm not they sure did.
[220:37] You know?
[220:38] You know mean?
[220:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[220:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[220:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[220:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[220:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[221:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[221:11] mid 2015,
[221:12] it's like,
[221:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[221:19] And then
[221:20] that's what happened.
[221:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[221:24] I mean,
[221:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[221:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[221:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[221:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[221:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[221:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[221:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[221:56] as a client,
[221:57] like, died,
[222:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[222:06] It's like, right.
[222:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[222:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[222:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[222:26] across solc,
[222:28] the tests,
[222:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[222:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[222:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[222:48] but
[222:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[222:53] Right?
[222:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[222:58] He was he was building that client.
[223:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[223:05] He was,
[223:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[223:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[223:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[223:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[223:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[223:27] Right?
[223:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[223:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[223:34] closer with Mist,
[223:37] you know, with on Mist.
[223:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[223:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[223:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[223:51] But but, yeah,
[223:53] that would make sense.
[223:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[223:59] And and
[224:00] wait.
[224:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[224:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[224:08] Yeah.
[224:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[224:13] But yeah.
[224:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[224:17] Okay.
[224:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[224:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[224:22] Yes.
[224:23] So, yeah,
[224:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[224:30] you know, for for f.
[224:32] It was called f.
[224:34] It was just called f the executable.
[224:38] So you'd have f and again,
[224:40] yeah, you had f.
[224:42] You had solc.
[224:44] You had
[224:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[224:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[224:50] Acute client.
[224:52] You had,
[224:53] which was the gooey miner.
[224:56] Yeah.
[224:57] That's right.
[224:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[225:05] And then you had one,
[225:07] which was sort of
[225:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[225:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[225:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[225:19] You're running a node,
[225:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[225:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[225:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[225:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[225:41] That's a lot.
[225:43] That that was a lot.
[225:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[225:52] Right?
[225:54] Right.
[225:55] Right.
[225:56] Right.
[225:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[226:00] I mean, when I started,
[226:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[226:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[226:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[226:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[226:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[226:20] Yeah.
[226:22] Dev p two p.
[226:23] Live p two p.
[226:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[226:29] documentation all over the place.
[226:31] I mean You know?
[226:33] I think, you know,
[226:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[226:45] it's like, right.
[226:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[226:51] Right?
[226:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[226:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[227:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[227:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[227:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[227:19] There was no
[227:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[227:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[227:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[227:32] So it's like, right.
[227:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[227:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[227:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[227:50] So yeah,
[227:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[227:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[228:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[228:07] and specifically
[228:09] decoupling
[228:10] and the tests from the client.
[228:14] Right?
[228:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[228:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[228:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[228:32] compiling QT,
[228:35] all of this stuff.
[228:37] So just to get you know?
[228:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[228:44] for Solsea either.
[228:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[228:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[228:55] You have to do all of that.
[228:57] So I remember,
[229:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[229:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[229:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[229:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[229:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[229:20] This is not great.
[229:22] It was my benefit.
[229:25] It's amazing.
[229:27] But, yeah,
[229:28] it was,
[229:30] yeah,
[229:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[229:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[229:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[229:41] coming back,
[229:42] looking at it,
[229:44] saying, like, this can't be
[229:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[229:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[230:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[230:07] you know, but you're right.
[230:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[230:14] You know, talking about that,
[230:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[230:21] and everything.
[230:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[230:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[230:32] because that seems,
[230:34] you know, in an organized way.
[230:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[230:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[230:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[230:45] You know, things as simple as,
[230:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[230:50] like, technical
[230:51] leads that actually lead?
[230:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[230:58] Have we got any IT ?
[231:00] Have we got
[231:02] anything?
[231:03] And it's like, no.
[231:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[231:09] And
[231:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[231:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[231:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[231:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[231:29] Right?
[231:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[231:35] Yeah.
[231:36] You know,
[231:38] I I
[231:39] alright.
[231:42] Okay.
[231:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[231:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[231:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[231:55] but it was kind of similar.
[231:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[232:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[232:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[232:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[232:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[232:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[232:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[232:37] And but it's, I think,
[232:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[232:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[232:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[232:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[233:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[233:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[233:09] Yeah.
[233:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[233:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[233:18] I was finding these the other day.
[233:21] I was finding the first commits
[233:24] for PyEthereum,
[233:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[233:33] and Go Ethereum.
[233:36] And they were all
[233:37] I think they were all November or December.
[233:41] I think they were all 2013,
[233:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[233:47] Yeah.
[233:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[233:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[233:56] But, you know, that was
[233:58] Yeah.
[233:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[234:03] Right?
[234:04] Yeah.
[234:05] We were much later.
[234:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[234:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[234:13] Yeah.
[234:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[234:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[234:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[234:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[234:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[234:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[234:36] September, October, something like that,
[234:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[234:46] More Jim than me.
[234:48] But so yeah,
[234:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[234:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[234:57] Yep.
[235:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[235:03] Right?
[235:04] I think probably
[235:06] they could have
[235:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[235:14] doing any hedging.
[235:17] And then later,
[235:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[235:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[235:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[235:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[235:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[235:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[235:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[236:03] get people to fight over it,
[236:06] but
[236:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[236:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[236:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[236:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[236:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[236:28] that was the whole world.
[236:30] Right?
[236:31] You know, that was everything,
[236:34] right, was several months
[236:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[236:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[236:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[236:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[236:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[236:55] sorry, 2013.
[237:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[237:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[237:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[237:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[237:20] going on.
[237:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[237:27] so just three further days.
[237:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[237:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[237:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[237:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[237:52] So,
[237:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[238:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[238:03] Oh,
[238:04] sorry.
[238:05] You
[238:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[238:11] Right?
[238:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[238:17] you had,
[238:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[238:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[238:26] Yeah.
[238:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[238:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[238:38] But
[238:39] then, yeah,
[238:40] following that,
[238:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[238:45] onto those teams.
[238:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[238:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[239:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[239:03] And then you
[239:05] and then you guys starting
[239:06] whenever you were starting.
[239:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[239:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[239:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[239:23] and you basically did have a major,
[239:27] you know,
[239:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[239:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[239:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[239:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[239:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[239:48] And then it's like, right.
[239:51] Sorry.
[239:52] You're out,
[239:54] and you're not getting any money.
[239:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[240:00] Yes.
[240:01] Do you
[240:02] so my memory
[240:04] around the C++ client was that
[240:06] there were funds to
[240:08] do a security audit
[240:10] for
[240:11] two clients,
[240:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[240:17] Right?
[240:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[240:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[240:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[240:33] I'm not they sure did.
[240:37] You know?
[240:38] You know mean?
[240:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[240:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[240:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[240:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[240:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[241:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[241:11] mid 2015,
[241:12] it's like,
[241:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[241:19] And then
[241:20] that's what happened.
[241:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[241:24] I mean,
[241:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[241:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[241:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[241:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[241:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[241:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[241:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[241:56] as a client,
[241:57] like, died,
[242:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[242:06] It's like, right.
[242:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[242:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[242:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[242:26] across solc,
[242:28] the tests,
[242:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[242:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[242:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[242:48] but
[242:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[242:53] Right?
[242:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[242:58] He was he was building that client.
[243:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[243:05] He was,
[243:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[243:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[243:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[243:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[243:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[243:27] Right?
[243:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[243:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[243:34] closer with Mist,
[243:37] you know, with on Mist.
[243:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[243:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[243:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[243:51] But but, yeah,
[243:53] that would make sense.
[243:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[243:59] And and
[244:00] wait.
[244:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[244:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[244:08] Yeah.
[244:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[244:13] But yeah.
[244:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[244:17] Okay.
[244:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[244:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[244:22] Yes.
[244:23] So, yeah,
[244:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[244:30] you know, for for f.
[244:32] It was called f.
[244:34] It was just called f the executable.
[244:38] So you'd have f and again,
[244:40] yeah, you had f.
[244:42] You had solc.
[244:44] You had
[244:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[244:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[244:50] Acute client.
[244:52] You had,
[244:53] which was the gooey miner.
[244:56] Yeah.
[244:57] That's right.
[244:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[245:05] And then you had one,
[245:07] which was sort of
[245:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[245:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[245:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[245:19] You're running a node,
[245:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[245:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[245:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[245:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[245:41] That's a lot.
[245:43] That that was a lot.
[245:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[245:52] Right?
[245:54] Right.
[245:55] Right.
[245:56] Right.
[245:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[246:00] I mean, when I started,
[246:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[246:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[246:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[246:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[246:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[246:20] Yeah.
[246:22] Dev p two p.
[246:23] Live p two p.
[246:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[246:29] documentation all over the place.
[246:31] I mean You know?
[246:33] I think, you know,
[246:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[246:45] it's like, right.
[246:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[246:51] Right?
[246:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[246:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[247:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[247:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[247:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[247:19] There was no
[247:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[247:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[247:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[247:32] So it's like, right.
[247:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[247:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[247:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[247:50] So yeah,
[247:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[247:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[248:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[248:07] and specifically
[248:09] decoupling
[248:10] and the tests from the client.
[248:14] Right?
[248:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[248:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[248:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[248:32] compiling QT,
[248:35] all of this stuff.
[248:37] So just to get you know?
[248:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[248:44] for Solsea either.
[248:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[248:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[248:55] You have to do all of that.
[248:57] So I remember,
[249:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[249:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[249:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[249:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[249:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[249:20] This is not great.
[249:22] It was my benefit.
[249:25] It's amazing.
[249:27] But, yeah,
[249:28] it was,
[249:30] yeah,
[249:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[249:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[249:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[249:41] coming back,
[249:42] looking at it,
[249:44] saying, like, this can't be
[249:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[249:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[250:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[250:07] you know, but you're right.
[250:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[250:14] You know, talking about that,
[250:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[250:21] and everything.
[250:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[250:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[250:32] because that seems,
[250:34] you know, in an organized way.
[250:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[250:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[250:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[250:45] You know, things as simple as,
[250:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[250:50] like, technical
[250:51] leads that actually lead?
[250:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[250:58] Have we got any IT ?
[251:00] Have we got
[251:02] anything?
[251:03] And it's like, no.
[251:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[251:09] And
[251:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[251:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[251:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[251:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[251:29] Right?
[251:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[251:35] Yeah.
[251:36] You know,
[251:38] I I
[251:39] alright.
[251:42] Okay.
[251:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[251:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[251:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[251:55] but it was kind of similar.
[251:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[252:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[252:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[252:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[252:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[252:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[252:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[252:37] And but it's, I think,
[252:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[252:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[252:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[252:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[253:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[253:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[253:09] Yeah.
[253:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[253:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[253:18] I was finding these the other day.
[253:21] I was finding the first commits
[253:24] for PyEthereum,
[253:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[253:33] and Go Ethereum.
[253:36] And they were all
[253:37] I think they were all November or December.
[253:41] I think they were all 2013,
[253:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[253:47] Yeah.
[253:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[253:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[253:56] But, you know, that was
[253:58] Yeah.
[253:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[254:03] Right?
[254:04] Yeah.
[254:05] We were much later.
[254:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[254:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[254:13] Yeah.
[254:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[254:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[254:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[254:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[254:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[254:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[254:36] September, October, something like that,
[254:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[254:46] More Jim than me.
[254:48] But so yeah,
[254:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[254:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[254:57] Yep.
[255:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[255:03] Right?
[255:04] I think probably
[255:06] they could have
[255:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[255:14] doing any hedging.
[255:17] And then later,
[255:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[255:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[255:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[255:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[255:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[255:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[255:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[256:03] get people to fight over it,
[256:06] but
[256:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[256:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[256:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[256:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[256:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[256:28] that was the whole world.
[256:30] Right?
[256:31] You know, that was everything,
[256:34] right, was several months
[256:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[256:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[256:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[256:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[256:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[256:55] sorry, 2013.
[257:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[257:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[257:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[257:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[257:20] going on.
[257:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[257:27] so just three further days.
[257:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[257:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[257:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[257:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[257:52] So,
[257:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[258:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[258:03] Oh,
[258:04] sorry.
[258:05] You
[258:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[258:11] Right?
[258:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[258:17] you had,
[258:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[258:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[258:26] Yeah.
[258:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[258:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[258:38] But
[258:39] then, yeah,
[258:40] following that,
[258:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[258:45] onto those teams.
[258:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[258:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[259:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[259:03] And then you
[259:05] and then you guys starting
[259:06] whenever you were starting.
[259:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[259:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[259:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[259:23] and you basically did have a major,
[259:27] you know,
[259:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[259:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[259:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[259:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[259:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[259:48] And then it's like, right.
[259:51] Sorry.
[259:52] You're out,
[259:54] and you're not getting any money.
[259:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[260:00] Yes.
[260:01] Do you
[260:02] so my memory
[260:04] around the C++ client was that
[260:06] there were funds to
[260:08] do a security audit
[260:10] for
[260:11] two clients,
[260:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[260:17] Right?
[260:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[260:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[260:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[260:33] I'm not they sure did.
[260:37] You know?
[260:38] You know mean?
[260:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[260:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[260:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[260:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[260:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[261:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[261:11] mid 2015,
[261:12] it's like,
[261:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[261:19] And then
[261:20] that's what happened.
[261:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[261:24] I mean,
[261:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[261:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[261:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[261:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[261:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[261:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[261:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[261:56] as a client,
[261:57] like, died,
[262:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[262:06] It's like, right.
[262:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[262:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[262:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[262:26] across solc,
[262:28] the tests,
[262:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[262:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[262:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[262:48] but
[262:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[262:53] Right?
[262:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[262:58] He was he was building that client.
[263:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[263:05] He was,
[263:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[263:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[263:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[263:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[263:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[263:27] Right?
[263:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[263:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[263:34] closer with Mist,
[263:37] you know, with on Mist.
[263:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[263:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[263:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[263:51] But but, yeah,
[263:53] that would make sense.
[263:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[263:59] And and
[264:00] wait.
[264:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[264:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[264:08] Yeah.
[264:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[264:13] But yeah.
[264:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[264:17] Okay.
[264:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[264:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[264:22] Yes.
[264:23] So, yeah,
[264:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[264:30] you know, for for f.
[264:32] It was called f.
[264:34] It was just called f the executable.
[264:38] So you'd have f and again,
[264:40] yeah, you had f.
[264:42] You had solc.
[264:44] You had
[264:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[264:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[264:50] Acute client.
[264:52] You had,
[264:53] which was the gooey miner.
[264:56] Yeah.
[264:57] That's right.
[264:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[265:05] And then you had one,
[265:07] which was sort of
[265:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[265:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[265:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[265:19] You're running a node,
[265:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[265:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[265:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[265:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[265:41] That's a lot.
[265:43] That that was a lot.
[265:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[265:52] Right?
[265:54] Right.
[265:55] Right.
[265:56] Right.
[265:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[266:00] I mean, when I started,
[266:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[266:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[266:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[266:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[266:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[266:20] Yeah.
[266:22] Dev p two p.
[266:23] Live p two p.
[266:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[266:29] documentation all over the place.
[266:31] I mean You know?
[266:33] I think, you know,
[266:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[266:45] it's like, right.
[266:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[266:51] Right?
[266:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[266:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[267:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[267:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[267:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[267:19] There was no
[267:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[267:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[267:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[267:32] So it's like, right.
[267:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[267:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[267:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[267:50] So yeah,
[267:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[267:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[268:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[268:07] and specifically
[268:09] decoupling
[268:10] and the tests from the client.
[268:14] Right?
[268:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[268:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[268:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[268:32] compiling QT,
[268:35] all of this stuff.
[268:37] So just to get you know?
[268:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[268:44] for Solsea either.
[268:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[268:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[268:55] You have to do all of that.
[268:57] So I remember,
[269:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[269:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[269:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[269:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[269:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[269:20] This is not great.
[269:22] It was my benefit.
[269:25] It's amazing.
[269:27] But, yeah,
[269:28] it was,
[269:30] yeah,
[269:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[269:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[269:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[269:41] coming back,
[269:42] looking at it,
[269:44] saying, like, this can't be
[269:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[269:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[270:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[270:07] you know, but you're right.
[270:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[270:14] You know, talking about that,
[270:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[270:21] and everything.
[270:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[270:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[270:32] because that seems,
[270:34] you know, in an organized way.
[270:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[270:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[270:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[270:45] You know, things as simple as,
[270:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[270:50] like, technical
[270:51] leads that actually lead?
[270:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[270:58] Have we got any IT ?
[271:00] Have we got
[271:02] anything?
[271:03] And it's like, no.
[271:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[271:09] And
[271:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[271:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[271:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[271:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[271:29] Right?
[271:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[271:35] Yeah.
[271:36] You know,
[271:38] I I
[271:39] alright.
[271:42] Okay.
[271:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[271:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[271:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[271:55] but it was kind of similar.
[271:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[272:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[272:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[272:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[272:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[272:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[272:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[272:37] And but it's, I think,
[272:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[272:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[272:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[272:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[273:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[273:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[273:09] Yeah.
[273:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[273:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[273:18] I was finding these the other day.
[273:21] I was finding the first commits
[273:24] for PyEthereum,
[273:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[273:33] and Go Ethereum.
[273:36] And they were all
[273:37] I think they were all November or December.
[273:41] I think they were all 2013,
[273:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[273:47] Yeah.
[273:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[273:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[273:56] But, you know, that was
[273:58] Yeah.
[273:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[274:03] Right?
[274:04] Yeah.
[274:05] We were much later.
[274:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[274:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[274:13] Yeah.
[274:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[274:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[274:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[274:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[274:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[274:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[274:36] September, October, something like that,
[274:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[274:46] More Jim than me.
[274:48] But so yeah,
[274:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[274:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[274:57] Yep.
[275:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[275:03] Right?
[275:04] I think probably
[275:06] they could have
[275:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[275:14] doing any hedging.
[275:17] And then later,
[275:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[275:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[275:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[275:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[275:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[275:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[275:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[276:03] get people to fight over it,
[276:06] but
[276:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[276:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[276:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[276:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[276:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[276:28] that was the whole world.
[276:30] Right?
[276:31] You know, that was everything,
[276:34] right, was several months
[276:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[276:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[276:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[276:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[276:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[276:55] sorry, 2013.
[277:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[277:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[277:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[277:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[277:20] going on.
[277:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[277:27] so just three further days.
[277:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[277:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[277:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[277:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[277:52] So,
[277:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[278:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[278:03] Oh,
[278:04] sorry.
[278:05] You
[278:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[278:11] Right?
[278:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[278:17] you had,
[278:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[278:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[278:26] Yeah.
[278:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[278:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[278:38] But
[278:39] then, yeah,
[278:40] following that,
[278:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[278:45] onto those teams.
[278:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[278:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[279:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[279:03] And then you
[279:05] and then you guys starting
[279:06] whenever you were starting.
[279:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[279:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[279:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[279:23] and you basically did have a major,
[279:27] you know,
[279:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[279:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[279:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[279:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[279:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[279:48] And then it's like, right.
[279:51] Sorry.
[279:52] You're out,
[279:54] and you're not getting any money.
[279:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[280:00] Yes.
[280:01] Do you
[280:02] so my memory
[280:04] around the C++ client was that
[280:06] there were funds to
[280:08] do a security audit
[280:10] for
[280:11] two clients,
[280:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[280:17] Right?
[280:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[280:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[280:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[280:33] I'm not they sure did.
[280:37] You know?
[280:38] You know mean?
[280:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[280:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[280:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[280:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[280:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[281:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[281:11] mid 2015,
[281:12] it's like,
[281:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[281:19] And then
[281:20] that's what happened.
[281:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[281:24] I mean,
[281:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[281:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[281:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[281:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[281:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[281:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[281:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[281:56] as a client,
[281:57] like, died,
[282:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[282:06] It's like, right.
[282:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[282:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[282:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[282:26] across solc,
[282:28] the tests,
[282:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[282:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[282:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[282:48] but
[282:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[282:53] Right?
[282:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[282:58] He was he was building that client.
[283:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[283:05] He was,
[283:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[283:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[283:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[283:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[283:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[283:27] Right?
[283:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[283:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[283:34] closer with Mist,
[283:37] you know, with on Mist.
[283:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[283:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[283:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[283:51] But but, yeah,
[283:53] that would make sense.
[283:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[283:59] And and
[284:00] wait.
[284:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[284:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[284:08] Yeah.
[284:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[284:13] But yeah.
[284:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[284:17] Okay.
[284:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[284:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[284:22] Yes.
[284:23] So, yeah,
[284:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[284:30] you know, for for f.
[284:32] It was called f.
[284:34] It was just called f the executable.
[284:38] So you'd have f and again,
[284:40] yeah, you had f.
[284:42] You had solc.
[284:44] You had
[284:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[284:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[284:50] Acute client.
[284:52] You had,
[284:53] which was the gooey miner.
[284:56] Yeah.
[284:57] That's right.
[284:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[285:05] And then you had one,
[285:07] which was sort of
[285:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[285:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[285:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[285:19] You're running a node,
[285:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[285:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[285:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[285:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[285:41] That's a lot.
[285:43] That that was a lot.
[285:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[285:52] Right?
[285:54] Right.
[285:55] Right.
[285:56] Right.
[285:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[286:00] I mean, when I started,
[286:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[286:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[286:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[286:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[286:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[286:20] Yeah.
[286:22] Dev p two p.
[286:23] Live p two p.
[286:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[286:29] documentation all over the place.
[286:31] I mean You know?
[286:33] I think, you know,
[286:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[286:45] it's like, right.
[286:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[286:51] Right?
[286:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[286:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[287:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[287:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[287:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[287:19] There was no
[287:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[287:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[287:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[287:32] So it's like, right.
[287:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[287:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[287:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[287:50] So yeah,
[287:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[287:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[288:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[288:07] and specifically
[288:09] decoupling
[288:10] and the tests from the client.
[288:14] Right?
[288:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[288:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[288:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[288:32] compiling QT,
[288:35] all of this stuff.
[288:37] So just to get you know?
[288:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[288:44] for Solsea either.
[288:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[288:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[288:55] You have to do all of that.
[288:57] So I remember,
[289:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[289:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[289:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[289:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[289:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[289:20] This is not great.
[289:22] It was my benefit.
[289:25] It's amazing.
[289:27] But, yeah,
[289:28] it was,
[289:30] yeah,
[289:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[289:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[289:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[289:41] coming back,
[289:42] looking at it,
[289:44] saying, like, this can't be
[289:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[289:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[290:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[290:07] you know, but you're right.
[290:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[290:14] You know, talking about that,
[290:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[290:21] and everything.
[290:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[290:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[290:32] because that seems,
[290:34] you know, in an organized way.
[290:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[290:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[290:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[290:45] You know, things as simple as,
[290:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[290:50] like, technical
[290:51] leads that actually lead?
[290:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[290:58] Have we got any IT ?
[291:00] Have we got
[291:02] anything?
[291:03] And it's like, no.
[291:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[291:09] And
[291:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[291:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[291:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[291:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[291:29] Right?
[291:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[291:35] Yeah.
[291:36] You know,
[291:38] I I
[291:39] alright.
[291:42] Okay.
[291:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[291:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[291:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[291:55] but it was kind of similar.
[291:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[292:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[292:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[292:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[292:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[292:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[292:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[292:37] And but it's, I think,
[292:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[292:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[292:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[292:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[293:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[293:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[293:09] Yeah.
[293:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[293:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[293:18] I was finding these the other day.
[293:21] I was finding the first commits
[293:24] for PyEthereum,
[293:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[293:33] and Go Ethereum.
[293:36] And they were all
[293:37] I think they were all November or December.
[293:41] I think they were all 2013,
[293:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[293:47] Yeah.
[293:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[293:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[293:56] But, you know, that was
[293:58] Yeah.
[293:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[294:03] Right?
[294:04] Yeah.
[294:05] We were much later.
[294:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[294:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[294:13] Yeah.
[294:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[294:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[294:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[294:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[294:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[294:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[294:36] September, October, something like that,
[294:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[294:46] More Jim than me.
[294:48] But so yeah,
[294:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[294:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[294:57] Yep.
[295:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[295:03] Right?
[295:04] I think probably
[295:06] they could have
[295:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[295:14] doing any hedging.
[295:17] And then later,
[295:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[295:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[295:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[295:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[295:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[295:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[295:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[296:03] get people to fight over it,
[296:06] but
[296:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[296:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[296:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[296:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[296:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[296:28] that was the whole world.
[296:30] Right?
[296:31] You know, that was everything,
[296:34] right, was several months
[296:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[296:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[296:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[296:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[296:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[296:55] sorry, 2013.
[297:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[297:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[297:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[297:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[297:20] going on.
[297:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[297:27] so just three further days.
[297:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[297:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[297:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[297:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[297:52] So,
[297:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[298:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[298:03] Oh,
[298:04] sorry.
[298:05] You
[298:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[298:11] Right?
[298:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[298:17] you had,
[298:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[298:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[298:26] Yeah.
[298:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[298:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[298:38] But
[298:39] then, yeah,
[298:40] following that,
[298:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[298:45] onto those teams.
[298:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[298:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[299:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[299:03] And then you
[299:05] and then you guys starting
[299:06] whenever you were starting.
[299:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[299:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[299:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[299:23] and you basically did have a major,
[299:27] you know,
[299:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[299:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[299:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[299:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[299:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[299:48] And then it's like, right.
[299:51] Sorry.
[299:52] You're out,
[299:54] and you're not getting any money.
[299:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[300:00] Yes.
[300:01] Do you
[300:02] so my memory
[300:04] around the C++ client was that
[300:06] there were funds to
[300:08] do a security audit
[300:10] for
[300:11] two clients,
[300:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[300:17] Right?
[300:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[300:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[300:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[300:33] I'm not they sure did.
[300:37] You know?
[300:38] You know mean?
[300:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[300:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[300:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[300:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[300:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[301:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[301:11] mid 2015,
[301:12] it's like,
[301:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[301:19] And then
[301:20] that's what happened.
[301:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[301:24] I mean,
[301:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[301:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[301:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[301:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[301:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[301:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[301:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[301:56] as a client,
[301:57] like, died,
[302:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[302:06] It's like, right.
[302:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[302:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[302:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[302:26] across solc,
[302:28] the tests,
[302:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[302:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[302:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[302:48] but
[302:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[302:53] Right?
[302:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[302:58] He was he was building that client.
[303:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[303:05] He was,
[303:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[303:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[303:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[303:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[303:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[303:27] Right?
[303:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[303:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[303:34] closer with Mist,
[303:37] you know, with on Mist.
[303:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[303:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[303:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[303:51] But but, yeah,
[303:53] that would make sense.
[303:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[303:59] And and
[304:00] wait.
[304:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[304:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[304:08] Yeah.
[304:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[304:13] But yeah.
[304:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[304:17] Okay.
[304:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[304:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[304:22] Yes.
[304:23] So, yeah,
[304:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[304:30] you know, for for f.
[304:32] It was called f.
[304:34] It was just called f the executable.
[304:38] So you'd have f and again,
[304:40] yeah, you had f.
[304:42] You had solc.
[304:44] You had
[304:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[304:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[304:50] Acute client.
[304:52] You had,
[304:53] which was the gooey miner.
[304:56] Yeah.
[304:57] That's right.
[304:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[305:05] And then you had one,
[305:07] which was sort of
[305:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[305:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[305:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[305:19] You're running a node,
[305:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[305:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[305:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[305:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[305:41] That's a lot.
[305:43] That that was a lot.
[305:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[305:52] Right?
[305:54] Right.
[305:55] Right.
[305:56] Right.
[305:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[306:00] I mean, when I started,
[306:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[306:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[306:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[306:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[306:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[306:20] Yeah.
[306:22] Dev p two p.
[306:23] Live p two p.
[306:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[306:29] documentation all over the place.
[306:31] I mean You know?
[306:33] I think, you know,
[306:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[306:45] it's like, right.
[306:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[306:51] Right?
[306:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[306:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[307:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[307:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[307:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[307:19] There was no
[307:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[307:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[307:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[307:32] So it's like, right.
[307:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[307:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[307:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[307:50] So yeah,
[307:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[307:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[308:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[308:07] and specifically
[308:09] decoupling
[308:10] and the tests from the client.
[308:14] Right?
[308:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[308:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[308:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[308:32] compiling QT,
[308:35] all of this stuff.
[308:37] So just to get you know?
[308:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[308:44] for Solsea either.
[308:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[308:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[308:55] You have to do all of that.
[308:57] So I remember,
[309:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[309:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[309:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[309:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[309:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[309:20] This is not great.
[309:22] It was my benefit.
[309:25] It's amazing.
[309:27] But, yeah,
[309:28] it was,
[309:30] yeah,
[309:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[309:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[309:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[309:41] coming back,
[309:42] looking at it,
[309:44] saying, like, this can't be
[309:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[309:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[310:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[310:07] you know, but you're right.
[310:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[310:14] You know, talking about that,
[310:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[310:21] and everything.
[310:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[310:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[310:32] because that seems,
[310:34] you know, in an organized way.
[310:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[310:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[310:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[310:45] You know, things as simple as,
[310:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[310:50] like, technical
[310:51] leads that actually lead?
[310:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[310:58] Have we got any IT ?
[311:00] Have we got
[311:02] anything?
[311:03] And it's like, no.
[311:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[311:09] And
[311:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[311:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[311:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[311:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[311:29] Right?
[311:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[311:35] Yeah.
[311:36] You know,
[311:38] I I
[311:39] alright.
[311:42] Okay.
[311:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[311:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[311:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[311:55] but it was kind of similar.
[311:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[312:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[312:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[312:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[312:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[312:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[312:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[312:37] And but it's, I think,
[312:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[312:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[312:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[312:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[313:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[313:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[313:09] Yeah.
[313:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[313:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[313:18] I was finding these the other day.
[313:21] I was finding the first commits
[313:24] for PyEthereum,
[313:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[313:33] and Go Ethereum.
[313:36] And they were all
[313:37] I think they were all November or December.
[313:41] I think they were all 2013,
[313:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[313:47] Yeah.
[313:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[313:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[313:56] But, you know, that was
[313:58] Yeah.
[313:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[314:03] Right?
[314:04] Yeah.
[314:05] We were much later.
[314:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[314:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[314:13] Yeah.
[314:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[314:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[314:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[314:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[314:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[314:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[314:36] September, October, something like that,
[314:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[314:46] More Jim than me.
[314:48] But so yeah,
[314:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[314:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[314:57] Yep.
[315:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[315:03] Right?
[315:04] I think probably
[315:06] they could have
[315:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[315:14] doing any hedging.
[315:17] And then later,
[315:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[315:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[315:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[315:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[315:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[315:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[315:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[316:03] get people to fight over it,
[316:06] but
[316:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[316:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[316:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[316:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[316:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[316:28] that was the whole world.
[316:30] Right?
[316:31] You know, that was everything,
[316:34] right, was several months
[316:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[316:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[316:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[316:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[316:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[316:55] sorry, 2013.
[317:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[317:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[317:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[317:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[317:20] going on.
[317:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[317:27] so just three further days.
[317:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[317:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[317:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[317:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[317:52] So,
[317:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[318:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[318:03] Oh,
[318:04] sorry.
[318:05] You
[318:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[318:11] Right?
[318:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[318:17] you had,
[318:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[318:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[318:26] Yeah.
[318:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[318:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[318:38] But
[318:39] then, yeah,
[318:40] following that,
[318:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[318:45] onto those teams.
[318:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[318:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[319:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[319:03] And then you
[319:05] and then you guys starting
[319:06] whenever you were starting.
[319:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[319:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[319:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[319:23] and you basically did have a major,
[319:27] you know,
[319:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[319:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[319:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[319:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[319:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[319:48] And then it's like, right.
[319:51] Sorry.
[319:52] You're out,
[319:54] and you're not getting any money.
[319:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[320:00] Yes.
[320:01] Do you
[320:02] so my memory
[320:04] around the C++ client was that
[320:06] there were funds to
[320:08] do a security audit
[320:10] for
[320:11] two clients,
[320:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[320:17] Right?
[320:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[320:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[320:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[320:33] I'm not they sure did.
[320:37] You know?
[320:38] You know mean?
[320:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[320:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[320:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[320:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[320:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[321:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[321:11] mid 2015,
[321:12] it's like,
[321:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[321:19] And then
[321:20] that's what happened.
[321:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[321:24] I mean,
[321:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[321:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[321:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[321:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[321:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[321:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[321:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[321:56] as a client,
[321:57] like, died,
[322:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[322:06] It's like, right.
[322:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[322:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[322:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[322:26] across solc,
[322:28] the tests,
[322:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[322:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[322:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[322:48] but
[322:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[322:53] Right?
[322:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[322:58] He was he was building that client.
[323:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[323:05] He was,
[323:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[323:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[323:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[323:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[323:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[323:27] Right?
[323:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[323:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[323:34] closer with Mist,
[323:37] you know, with on Mist.
[323:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[323:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[323:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[323:51] But but, yeah,
[323:53] that would make sense.
[323:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[323:59] And and
[324:00] wait.
[324:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[324:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[324:08] Yeah.
[324:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[324:13] But yeah.
[324:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[324:17] Okay.
[324:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[324:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[324:22] Yes.
[324:23] So, yeah,
[324:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[324:30] you know, for for f.
[324:32] It was called f.
[324:34] It was just called f the executable.
[324:38] So you'd have f and again,
[324:40] yeah, you had f.
[324:42] You had solc.
[324:44] You had
[324:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[324:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[324:50] Acute client.
[324:52] You had,
[324:53] which was the gooey miner.
[324:56] Yeah.
[324:57] That's right.
[324:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[325:05] And then you had one,
[325:07] which was sort of
[325:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[325:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[325:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[325:19] You're running a node,
[325:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[325:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[325:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[325:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[325:41] That's a lot.
[325:43] That that was a lot.
[325:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[325:52] Right?
[325:54] Right.
[325:55] Right.
[325:56] Right.
[325:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[326:00] I mean, when I started,
[326:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[326:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[326:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[326:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[326:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[326:20] Yeah.
[326:22] Dev p two p.
[326:23] Live p two p.
[326:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[326:29] documentation all over the place.
[326:31] I mean You know?
[326:33] I think, you know,
[326:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[326:45] it's like, right.
[326:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[326:51] Right?
[326:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[326:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[327:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[327:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[327:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[327:19] There was no
[327:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[327:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[327:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[327:32] So it's like, right.
[327:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[327:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[327:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[327:50] So yeah,
[327:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[327:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[328:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[328:07] and specifically
[328:09] decoupling
[328:10] and the tests from the client.
[328:14] Right?
[328:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[328:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[328:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[328:32] compiling QT,
[328:35] all of this stuff.
[328:37] So just to get you know?
[328:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[328:44] for Solsea either.
[328:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[328:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[328:55] You have to do all of that.
[328:57] So I remember,
[329:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[329:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[329:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[329:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[329:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[329:20] This is not great.
[329:22] It was my benefit.
[329:25] It's amazing.
[329:27] But, yeah,
[329:28] it was,
[329:30] yeah,
[329:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[329:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[329:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[329:41] coming back,
[329:42] looking at it,
[329:44] saying, like, this can't be
[329:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[329:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[330:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[330:07] you know, but you're right.
[330:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[330:14] You know, talking about that,
[330:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[330:21] and everything.
[330:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[330:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[330:32] because that seems,
[330:34] you know, in an organized way.
[330:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[330:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[330:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[330:45] You know, things as simple as,
[330:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[330:50] like, technical
[330:51] leads that actually lead?
[330:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[330:58] Have we got any IT ?
[331:00] Have we got
[331:02] anything?
[331:03] And it's like, no.
[331:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[331:09] And
[331:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[331:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[331:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[331:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[331:29] Right?
[331:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[331:35] Yeah.
[331:36] You know,
[331:38] I I
[331:39] alright.
[331:42] Okay.
[331:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[331:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[331:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[331:55] but it was kind of similar.

[334:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[334:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[334:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[334:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[334:36] September, October, something like that,
[334:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[334:46] More Jim than me.
[334:48] But so yeah,
[334:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[334:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[334:57] Yep.
[335:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[335:03] Right?
[335:04] I think probably
[335:06] they could have
[335:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[335:14] doing any hedging.
[335:17] And then later,
[335:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[335:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[335:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[335:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[335:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[335:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[335:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[336:03] get people to fight over it,
[336:06] but
[336:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[336:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[336:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[336:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[336:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[336:28] that was the whole world.
[336:30] Right?
[336:31] You know, that was everything,
[336:34] right, was several months
[336:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[336:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[336:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[336:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[336:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[336:55] sorry, 2013.
[337:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[337:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[337:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[337:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[337:20] going on.
[337:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[337:27] so just three further days.
[337:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[337:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[337:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[337:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[337:52] So,
[337:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[338:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[338:03] Oh,
[338:04] sorry.
[338:05] You
[338:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[338:11] Right?
[338:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[338:17] you had,
[338:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[338:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[338:26] Yeah.
[338:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[338:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[338:38] But
[338:39] then, yeah,
[338:40] following that,
[338:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[338:45] onto those teams.
[338:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[338:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[339:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[339:03] And then you
[339:05] and then you guys starting
[339:06] whenever you were starting.
[339:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[339:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[339:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[339:23] and you basically did have a major,
[339:27] you know,
[339:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[339:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[339:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[339:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[339:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[339:48] And then it's like, right.
[339:51] Sorry.
[339:52] You're out,
[339:54] and you're not getting any money.
[339:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[340:00] Yes.
[340:01] Do you
[340:02] so my memory
[340:04] around the C++ client was that
[340:06] there were funds to
[340:08] do a security audit
[340:10] for
[340:11] two clients,
[340:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[340:17] Right?
[340:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[340:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[340:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[340:33] I'm not they sure did.
[340:37] You know?
[340:38] You know mean?
[340:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[340:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[340:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[340:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[340:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[341:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[341:11] mid 2015,
[341:12] it's like,
[341:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[341:19] And then
[341:20] that's what happened.
[341:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[341:24] I mean,
[341:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[341:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[341:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[341:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[341:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[341:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[341:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[341:56] as a client,
[341:57] like, died,
[342:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[342:06] It's like, right.
[342:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[342:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[342:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[342:26] across solc,
[342:28] the tests,
[342:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[342:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[342:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[342:48] but
[342:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[342:53] Right?
[342:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[342:58] He was he was building that client.
[343:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[343:05] He was,
[343:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[343:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[343:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[343:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[343:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[343:27] Right?
[343:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[343:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[343:34] closer with Mist,
[343:37] you know, with on Mist.
[343:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[343:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[343:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[343:51] But but, yeah,
[343:53] that would make sense.
[343:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[343:59] And and
[344:00] wait.
[344:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[344:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[344:08] Yeah.
[344:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[344:13] But yeah.
[344:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[344:17] Okay.
[344:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[344:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[344:22] Yes.
[344:23] So, yeah,
[344:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[344:30] you know, for for f.
[344:32] It was called f.
[344:34] It was just called f the executable.
[344:38] So you'd have f and again,
[344:40] yeah, you had f.
[344:42] You had solc.
[344:44] You had
[344:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[344:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[344:50] Acute client.
[344:52] You had,
[344:53] which was the gooey miner.
[344:56] Yeah.
[344:57] That's right.
[344:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[345:05] And then you had one,
[345:07] which was sort of
[345:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[345:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[345:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[345:19] You're running a node,
[345:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[345:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[345:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[345:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[345:41] That's a lot.
[345:43] That that was a lot.
[345:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[345:52] Right?
[345:54] Right.
[345:55] Right.
[345:56] Right.
[345:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[346:00] I mean, when I started,
[346:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[346:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[346:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[346:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[346:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[346:20] Yeah.
[346:22] Dev p two p.
[346:23] Live p two p.
[346:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[346:29] documentation all over the place.
[346:31] I mean You know?
[346:33] I think, you know,
[346:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[346:45] it's like, right.
[346:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[346:51] Right?
[346:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[346:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[347:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[347:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[347:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[347:19] There was no
[347:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[347:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[347:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[347:32] So it's like, right.
[347:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[347:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[347:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[347:50] So yeah,
[347:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[347:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[348:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[348:07] and specifically
[348:09] decoupling
[348:10] and the tests from the client.
[348:14] Right?
[348:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[348:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[348:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[348:32] compiling QT,
[348:35] all of this stuff.
[348:37] So just to get you know?
[348:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[348:44] for Solsea either.
[348:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[348:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[348:55] You have to do all of that.
[348:57] So I remember,
[349:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[349:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[349:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[349:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[349:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[349:20] This is not great.
[349:22] It was my benefit.
[349:25] It's amazing.
[349:27] But, yeah,
[349:28] it was,
[349:30] yeah,
[349:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[349:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[349:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[349:41] coming back,
[349:42] looking at it,
[349:44] saying, like, this can't be
[349:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[349:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[350:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[350:07] you know, but you're right.
[350:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[350:14] You know, talking about that,
[350:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[350:21] and everything.
[350:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[350:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[350:32] because that seems,
[350:34] you know, in an organized way.
[350:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[350:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[350:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[350:45] You know, things as simple as,
[350:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[350:50] like, technical
[350:51] leads that actually lead?
[350:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[350:58] Have we got any IT ?
[351:00] Have we got
[351:02] anything?
[351:03] And it's like, no.
[351:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[351:09] And
[351:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[351:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[351:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[351:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[351:29] Right?
[351:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[351:35] Yeah.
[351:36] You know,
[351:38] I I
[351:39] alright.
[351:42] Okay.
[351:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[351:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[351:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[351:55] but it was kind of similar.
[351:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[352:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[352:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[352:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[352:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[352:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[352:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[352:37] And but it's, I think,
[352:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[352:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[352:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[352:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[353:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[353:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[353:09] Yeah.
[353:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[353:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[353:18] I was finding these the other day.
[353:21] I was finding the first commits
[353:24] for PyEthereum,
[353:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[353:33] and Go Ethereum.
[353:36] And they were all
[353:37] I think they were all November or December.
[353:41] I think they were all 2013,
[353:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[353:47] Yeah.
[353:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[353:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[353:56] But, you know, that was
[353:58] Yeah.
[353:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[354:03] Right?
[354:04] Yeah.
[354:05] We were much later.
[354:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[354:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[354:13] Yeah.
[354:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[354:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[354:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[354:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[354:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[354:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[354:36] September, October, something like that,
[354:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[354:46] More Jim than me.
[354:48] But so yeah,
[354:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[354:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[354:57] Yep.
[355:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[355:03] Right?
[355:04] I think probably
[355:06] they could have
[355:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[355:14] doing any hedging.
[355:17] And then later,
[355:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[355:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[355:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[355:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[355:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[355:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[355:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[356:03] get people to fight over it,
[356:06] but
[356:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[356:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[356:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[356:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[356:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[356:28] that was the whole world.
[356:30] Right?
[356:31] You know, that was everything,
[356:34] right, was several months
[356:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[356:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[356:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[356:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[356:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[356:55] sorry, 2013.
[357:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[357:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[357:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[357:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[357:20] going on.
[357:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[357:27] so just three further days.
[357:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[357:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[357:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[357:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[357:52] So,
[357:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[358:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[358:03] Oh,
[358:04] sorry.
[358:05] You
[358:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[358:11] Right?
[358:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[358:17] you had,
[358:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[358:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[358:26] Yeah.
[358:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[358:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[358:38] But
[358:39] then, yeah,
[358:40] following that,
[358:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[358:45] onto those teams.
[358:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[358:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[359:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[359:03] And then you
[359:05] and then you guys starting
[359:06] whenever you were starting.
[359:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[359:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[359:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[359:23] and you basically did have a major,
[359:27] you know,
[359:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[359:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[359:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[359:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[359:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[359:48] And then it's like, right.
[359:51] Sorry.
[359:52] You're out,
[359:54] and you're not getting any money.
[359:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[360:00] Yes.
[360:01] Do you
[360:02] so my memory
[360:04] around the C++ client was that
[360:06] there were funds to
[360:08] do a security audit
[360:10] for
[360:11] two clients,
[360:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[360:17] Right?
[360:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[360:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[360:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[360:33] I'm not they sure did.
[360:37] You know?
[360:38] You know mean?
[360:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[360:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[360:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[360:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[360:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[361:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[361:11] mid 2015,
[361:12] it's like,
[361:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[361:19] And then
[361:20] that's what happened.
[361:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[361:24] I mean,
[361:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[361:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[361:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[361:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[361:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[361:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[361:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[361:56] as a client,
[361:57] like, died,
[362:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[362:06] It's like, right.
[362:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[362:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[362:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[362:26] across solc,
[362:28] the tests,
[362:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[362:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[362:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[362:48] but
[362:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[362:53] Right?
[362:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[362:58] He was he was building that client.
[363:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[363:05] He was,
[363:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[363:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[363:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[363:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[363:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[363:27] Right?
[363:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[363:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[363:34] closer with Mist,
[363:37] you know, with on Mist.
[363:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[363:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[363:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[363:51] But but, yeah,
[363:53] that would make sense.
[363:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[363:59] And and
[364:00] wait.
[364:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[364:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[364:08] Yeah.
[364:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[364:13] But yeah.
[364:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[364:17] Okay.
[364:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[364:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[364:22] Yes.
[364:23] So, yeah,
[364:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[364:30] you know, for for f.
[364:32] It was called f.
[364:34] It was just called f the executable.
[364:38] So you'd have f and again,
[364:40] yeah, you had f.
[364:42] You had solc.
[364:44] You had
[364:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[364:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[364:50] Acute client.
[364:52] You had,
[364:53] which was the gooey miner.
[364:56] Yeah.
[364:57] That's right.
[364:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[365:05] And then you had one,
[365:07] which was sort of
[365:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[365:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[365:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[365:19] You're running a node,
[365:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[365:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[365:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[365:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[365:41] That's a lot.
[365:43] That that was a lot.
[365:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[365:52] Right?
[365:54] Right.
[365:55] Right.
[365:56] Right.
[365:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[366:00] I mean, when I started,
[366:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[366:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[366:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[366:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[366:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[366:20] Yeah.
[366:22] Dev p two p.
[366:23] Live p two p.
[366:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[366:29] documentation all over the place.
[366:31] I mean You know?
[366:33] I think, you know,
[366:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[366:45] it's like, right.
[366:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[366:51] Right?
[366:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[366:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[367:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[367:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[367:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[367:19] There was no
[367:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[367:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[367:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[367:32] So it's like, right.
[367:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[367:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[367:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[367:50] So yeah,
[367:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[367:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[368:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[368:07] and specifically
[368:09] decoupling
[368:10] and the tests from the client.
[368:14] Right?
[368:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[368:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[368:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[368:32] compiling QT,
[368:35] all of this stuff.
[368:37] So just to get you know?
[368:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[368:44] for Solsea either.
[368:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[368:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[368:55] You have to do all of that.
[368:57] So I remember,
[369:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[369:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[369:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[369:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[369:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[369:20] This is not great.
[369:22] It was my benefit.
[369:25] It's amazing.
[369:27] But, yeah,
[369:28] it was,
[369:30] yeah,
[369:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[369:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[369:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[369:41] coming back,
[369:42] looking at it,
[369:44] saying, like, this can't be
[369:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[369:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[370:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[370:07] you know, but you're right.
[370:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[370:14] You know, talking about that,
[370:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[370:21] and everything.
[370:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[370:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[370:32] because that seems,
[370:34] you know, in an organized way.
[370:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[370:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[370:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[370:45] You know, things as simple as,
[370:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[370:50] like, technical
[370:51] leads that actually lead?
[370:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[370:58] Have we got any IT ?
[371:00] Have we got
[371:02] anything?
[371:03] And it's like, no.
[371:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[371:09] And
[371:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[371:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[371:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[371:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[371:29] Right?
[371:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[371:35] Yeah.
[371:36] You know,
[371:38] I I
[371:39] alright.
[371:42] Okay.
[371:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[371:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[371:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[371:55] but it was kind of similar.
[371:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[372:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[372:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[372:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[372:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[372:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[372:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[372:37] And but it's, I think,
[372:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[372:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[372:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[372:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[373:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[373:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[373:09] Yeah.
[373:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[373:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[373:18] I was finding these the other day.
[373:21] I was finding the first commits
[373:24] for PyEthereum,
[373:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[373:33] and Go Ethereum.
[373:36] And they were all
[373:37] I think they were all November or December.
[373:41] I think they were all 2013,
[373:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[373:47] Yeah.
[373:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[373:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[373:56] But, you know, that was
[373:58] Yeah.
[373:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[374:03] Right?
[374:04] Yeah.
[374:05] We were much later.
[374:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[374:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[374:13] Yeah.
[374:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[374:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[374:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[374:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[374:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[374:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[374:36] September, October, something like that,
[374:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[374:46] More Jim than me.
[374:48] But so yeah,
[374:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[374:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[374:57] Yep.
[375:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[375:03] Right?
[375:04] I think probably
[375:06] they could have
[375:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[375:14] doing any hedging.
[375:17] And then later,
[375:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[375:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[375:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[375:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[375:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[375:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[375:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[376:03] get people to fight over it,
[376:06] but
[376:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[376:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[376:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[376:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[376:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[376:28] that was the whole world.
[376:30] Right?
[376:31] You know, that was everything,
[376:34] right, was several months
[376:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[376:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[376:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[376:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[376:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[376:55] sorry, 2013.
[377:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[377:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[377:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[377:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[377:20] going on.
[377:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[377:27] so just three further days.
[377:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[377:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[377:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[377:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[377:52] So,
[377:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[378:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[378:03] Oh,
[378:04] sorry.
[378:05] You
[378:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[378:11] Right?
[378:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[378:17] you had,
[378:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[378:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[378:26] Yeah.
[378:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[378:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[378:38] But
[378:39] then, yeah,
[378:40] following that,
[378:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[378:45] onto those teams.
[378:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[378:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[379:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[379:03] And then you
[379:05] and then you guys starting
[379:06] whenever you were starting.
[379:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[379:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[379:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[379:23] and you basically did have a major,
[379:27] you know,
[379:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[379:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[379:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[379:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[379:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[379:48] And then it's like, right.
[379:51] Sorry.
[379:52] You're out,
[379:54] and you're not getting any money.
[379:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[380:00] Yes.
[380:01] Do you
[380:02] so my memory
[380:04] around the C++ client was that
[380:06] there were funds to
[380:08] do a security audit
[380:10] for
[380:11] two clients,
[380:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[380:17] Right?
[380:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[380:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[380:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[380:33] I'm not they sure did.
[380:37] You know?
[380:38] You know mean?
[380:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[380:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[380:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[380:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[380:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[381:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[381:11] mid 2015,
[381:12] it's like,
[381:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[381:19] And then
[381:20] that's what happened.
[381:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[381:24] I mean,
[381:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[381:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[381:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[381:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[381:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[381:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[381:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[381:56] as a client,
[381:57] like, died,
[382:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[382:06] It's like, right.
[382:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[382:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[382:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[382:26] across solc,
[382:28] the tests,
[382:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[382:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[382:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[382:48] but
[382:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[382:53] Right?
[382:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[382:58] He was he was building that client.
[383:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[383:05] He was,
[383:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[383:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[383:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[383:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[383:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[383:27] Right?
[383:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[383:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[383:34] closer with Mist,
[383:37] you know, with on Mist.
[383:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[383:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[383:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[383:51] But but, yeah,
[383:53] that would make sense.
[383:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[383:59] And and
[384:00] wait.
[384:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[384:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[384:08] Yeah.
[384:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[384:13] But yeah.
[384:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[384:17] Okay.
[384:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[384:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[384:22] Yes.
[384:23] So, yeah,
[384:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[384:30] you know, for for f.
[384:32] It was called f.
[384:34] It was just called f the executable.
[384:38] So you'd have f and again,
[384:40] yeah, you had f.
[384:42] You had solc.
[384:44] You had
[384:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[384:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[384:50] Acute client.
[384:52] You had,
[384:53] which was the gooey miner.
[384:56] Yeah.
[384:57] That's right.
[384:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[385:05] And then you had one,
[385:07] which was sort of
[385:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[385:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[385:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[385:19] You're running a node,
[385:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[385:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[385:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[385:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[385:41] That's a lot.
[385:43] That that was a lot.
[385:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[385:52] Right?
[385:54] Right.
[385:55] Right.
[385:56] Right.
[385:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[386:00] I mean, when I started,
[386:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[386:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[386:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[386:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[386:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[386:20] Yeah.
[386:22] Dev p two p.
[386:23] Live p two p.
[386:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[386:29] documentation all over the place.
[386:31] I mean You know?
[386:33] I think, you know,
[386:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[386:45] it's like, right.
[386:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[386:51] Right?
[386:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[386:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[387:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[387:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[387:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[387:19] There was no
[387:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[387:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[387:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[387:32] So it's like, right.
[387:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[387:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[387:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[387:50] So yeah,
[387:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[387:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[388:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[388:07] and specifically
[388:09] decoupling
[388:10] and the tests from the client.
[388:14] Right?
[388:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[388:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[388:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[388:32] compiling QT,
[388:35] all of this stuff.
[388:37] So just to get you know?
[388:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[388:44] for Solsea either.
[388:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[388:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[388:55] You have to do all of that.
[388:57] So I remember,
[389:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[389:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[389:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[389:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[389:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[389:20] This is not great.
[389:22] It was my benefit.
[389:25] It's amazing.
[389:27] But, yeah,
[389:28] it was,
[389:30] yeah,
[389:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[389:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[389:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[389:41] coming back,
[389:42] looking at it,
[389:44] saying, like, this can't be
[389:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[389:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[390:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[390:07] you know, but you're right.
[390:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[390:14] You know, talking about that,
[390:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[390:21] and everything.
[390:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[390:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[390:32] because that seems,
[390:34] you know, in an organized way.
[390:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[390:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[390:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[390:45] You know, things as simple as,
[390:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[390:50] like, technical
[390:51] leads that actually lead?
[390:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[390:58] Have we got any IT ?
[391:00] Have we got
[391:02] anything?
[391:03] And it's like, no.
[391:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[391:09] And
[391:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[391:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[391:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[391:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[391:29] Right?
[391:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[391:35] Yeah.
[391:36] You know,
[391:38] I I
[391:39] alright.
[391:42] Okay.
[391:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[391:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[391:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[391:55] but it was kind of similar.
[391:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[392:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[392:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[392:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[392:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[392:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[392:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[392:37] And but it's, I think,
[392:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[392:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[392:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[392:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[393:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[393:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[393:09] Yeah.
[393:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[393:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[393:18] I was finding these the other day.
[393:21] I was finding the first commits
[393:24] for PyEthereum,
[393:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[393:33] and Go Ethereum.
[393:36] And they were all
[393:37] I think they were all November or December.
[393:41] I think they were all 2013,
[393:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[393:47] Yeah.
[393:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[393:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[393:56] But, you know, that was
[393:58] Yeah.
[393:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[394:03] Right?
[394:04] Yeah.
[394:05] We were much later.
[394:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[394:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[394:13] Yeah.
[394:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[394:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[394:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[394:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[394:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[394:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[394:36] September, October, something like that,
[394:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[394:46] More Jim than me.
[394:48] But so yeah,
[394:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[394:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[394:57] Yep.
[395:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[395:03] Right?
[395:04] I think probably
[395:06] they could have
[395:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[395:14] doing any hedging.
[395:17] And then later,
[395:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[395:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[395:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[395:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[395:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[395:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[395:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[396:03] get people to fight over it,
[396:06] but
[396:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[396:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[396:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[396:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[396:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[396:28] that was the whole world.
[396:30] Right?
[396:31] You know, that was everything,
[396:34] right, was several months
[396:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[396:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[396:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[396:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[396:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[396:55] sorry, 2013.
[397:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[397:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[397:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[397:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[397:20] going on.
[397:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[397:27] so just three further days.
[397:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[397:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[397:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[397:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[397:52] So,
[397:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[398:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[398:03] Oh,
[398:04] sorry.
[398:05] You
[398:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[398:11] Right?
[398:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[398:17] you had,
[398:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[398:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[398:26] Yeah.
[398:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[398:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[398:38] But
[398:39] then, yeah,
[398:40] following that,
[398:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[398:45] onto those teams.
[398:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[398:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[399:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[399:03] And then you
[399:05] and then you guys starting
[399:06] whenever you were starting.
[399:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[399:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[399:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[399:23] and you basically did have a major,
[399:27] you know,
[399:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[399:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[399:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[399:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[399:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[399:48] And then it's like, right.
[399:51] Sorry.
[399:52] You're out,
[399:54] and you're not getting any money.
[399:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[400:00] Yes.
[400:01] Do you
[400:02] so my memory
[400:04] around the C++ client was that
[400:06] there were funds to
[400:08] do a security audit
[400:10] for
[400:11] two clients,
[400:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[400:17] Right?
[400:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[400:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[400:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[400:33] I'm not they sure did.
[400:37] You know?
[400:38] You know mean?
[400:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[400:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[400:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[400:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[400:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[401:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[401:11] mid 2015,
[401:12] it's like,
[401:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[401:19] And then
[401:20] that's what happened.
[401:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[401:24] I mean,
[401:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[401:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[401:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[401:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[401:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[401:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[401:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[401:56] as a client,
[401:57] like, died,
[402:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[402:06] It's like, right.
[402:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[402:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[402:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[402:26] across solc,
[402:28] the tests,
[402:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[402:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[402:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[402:48] but
[402:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[402:53] Right?
[402:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[402:58] He was he was building that client.
[403:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[403:05] He was,
[403:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[403:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[403:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[403:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[403:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[403:27] Right?
[403:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[403:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[403:34] closer with Mist,
[403:37] you know, with on Mist.
[403:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[403:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[403:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[403:51] But but, yeah,
[403:53] that would make sense.
[403:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[403:59] And and
[404:00] wait.
[404:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[404:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[404:08] Yeah.
[404:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[404:13] But yeah.
[404:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[404:17] Okay.
[404:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[404:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[404:22] Yes.
[404:23] So, yeah,
[404:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[404:30] you know, for for f.
[404:32] It was called f.
[404:34] It was just called f the executable.
[404:38] So you'd have f and again,
[404:40] yeah, you had f.
[404:42] You had solc.
[404:44] You had
[404:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[404:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[404:50] Acute client.
[404:52] You had,
[404:53] which was the gooey miner.
[404:56] Yeah.
[404:57] That's right.
[404:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[405:05] And then you had one,
[405:07] which was sort of
[405:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[405:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[405:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[405:19] You're running a node,
[405:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[405:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[405:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[405:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[405:41] That's a lot.
[405:43] That that was a lot.
[405:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[405:52] Right?
[405:54] Right.
[405:55] Right.
[405:56] Right.
[405:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[406:00] I mean, when I started,
[406:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[406:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[406:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[406:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[406:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[406:20] Yeah.
[406:22] Dev p two p.
[406:23] Live p two p.
[406:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[406:29] documentation all over the place.
[406:31] I mean You know?
[406:33] I think, you know,
[406:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[406:45] it's like, right.
[406:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[406:51] Right?
[406:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[406:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[407:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[407:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[407:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[407:19] There was no
[407:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[407:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[407:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[407:32] So it's like, right.
[407:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[407:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[407:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[407:50] So yeah,
[407:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[407:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[408:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[408:07] and specifically
[408:09] decoupling
[408:10] and the tests from the client.
[408:14] Right?
[408:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[408:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[408:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[408:32] compiling QT,
[408:35] all of this stuff.
[408:37] So just to get you know?
[408:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[408:44] for Solsea either.
[408:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[408:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[408:55] You have to do all of that.
[408:57] So I remember,
[409:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[409:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[409:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[409:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[409:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[409:20] This is not great.
[409:22] It was my benefit.
[409:25] It's amazing.
[409:27] But, yeah,
[409:28] it was,
[409:30] yeah,
[409:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[409:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[409:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[409:41] coming back,
[409:42] looking at it,
[409:44] saying, like, this can't be
[409:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[409:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[410:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[410:07] you know, but you're right.
[410:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[410:14] You know, talking about that,
[410:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[410:21] and everything.
[410:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[410:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[410:32] because that seems,
[410:34] you know, in an organized way.
[410:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[410:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[410:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[410:45] You know, things as simple as,
[410:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[410:50] like, technical
[410:51] leads that actually lead?
[410:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[410:58] Have we got any IT ?
[411:00] Have we got
[411:02] anything?
[411:03] And it's like, no.
[411:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[411:09] And
[411:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[411:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[411:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[411:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[411:29] Right?
[411:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[411:35] Yeah.
[411:36] You know,
[411:38] I I
[411:39] alright.
[411:42] Okay.
[411:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[411:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[411:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[411:55] but it was kind of similar.
[411:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[412:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[412:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[412:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[412:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[412:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[412:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[412:37] And but it's, I think,
[412:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[412:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[412:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[412:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[413:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[413:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[413:09] Yeah.
[413:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[413:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[413:18] I was finding these the other day.
[413:21] I was finding the first commits
[413:24] for PyEthereum,
[413:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[413:33] and Go Ethereum.
[413:36] And they were all
[413:37] I think they were all November or December.
[413:41] I think they were all 2013,
[413:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[413:47] Yeah.
[413:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[413:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[413:56] But, you know, that was
[413:58] Yeah.
[413:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[414:03] Right?
[414:04] Yeah.
[414:05] We were much later.
[414:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[414:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[414:13] Yeah.
[414:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[414:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[414:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[414:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[414:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[414:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[414:36] September, October, something like that,
[414:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[414:46] More Jim than me.
[414:48] But so yeah,
[414:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[414:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[414:57] Yep.
[415:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[415:03] Right?
[415:04] I think probably
[415:06] they could have
[415:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[415:14] doing any hedging.
[415:17] And then later,
[415:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[415:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[415:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[415:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[415:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[415:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[415:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[416:03] get people to fight over it,
[416:06] but
[416:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[416:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[416:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[416:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[416:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[416:28] that was the whole world.
[416:30] Right?
[416:31] You know, that was everything,
[416:34] right, was several months
[416:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[416:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[416:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[416:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[416:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[416:55] sorry, 2013.
[417:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[417:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[417:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[417:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[417:20] going on.
[417:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[417:27] so just three further days.
[417:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[417:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[417:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[417:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[417:52] So,
[417:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[418:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[418:03] Oh,
[418:04] sorry.
[418:05] You
[418:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[418:11] Right?
[418:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[418:17] you had,
[418:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[418:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[418:26] Yeah.
[418:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[418:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[418:38] But
[418:39] then, yeah,
[418:40] following that,
[418:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[418:45] onto those teams.
[418:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[418:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[419:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[419:03] And then you
[419:05] and then you guys starting
[419:06] whenever you were starting.
[419:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[419:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[419:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[419:23] and you basically did have a major,
[419:27] you know,
[419:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[419:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[419:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[419:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[419:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[419:48] And then it's like, right.
[419:51] Sorry.
[419:52] You're out,
[419:54] and you're not getting any money.
[419:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[420:00] Yes.
[420:01] Do you
[420:02] so my memory
[420:04] around the C++ client was that
[420:06] there were funds to
[420:08] do a security audit
[420:10] for
[420:11] two clients,
[420:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[420:17] Right?
[420:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[420:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[420:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[420:33] I'm not they sure did.
[420:37] You know?
[420:38] You know mean?
[420:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[420:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[420:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[420:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[420:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[421:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[421:11] mid 2015,
[421:12] it's like,
[421:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[421:19] And then
[421:20] that's what happened.
[421:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[421:24] I mean,
[421:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[421:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[421:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[421:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[421:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[421:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[421:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[421:56] as a client,
[421:57] like, died,
[422:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[422:06] It's like, right.
[422:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[422:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[422:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[422:26] across solc,
[422:28] the tests,
[422:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[422:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[422:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[422:48] but
[422:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[422:53] Right?
[422:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[422:58] He was he was building that client.
[423:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[423:05] He was,
[423:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[423:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[423:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[423:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[423:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[423:27] Right?
[423:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[423:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[423:34] closer with Mist,
[423:37] you know, with on Mist.
[423:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[423:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[423:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[423:51] But but, yeah,
[423:53] that would make sense.
[423:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[423:59] And and
[424:00] wait.
[424:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[424:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[424:08] Yeah.
[424:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[424:13] But yeah.
[424:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[424:17] Okay.
[424:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[424:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[424:22] Yes.
[424:23] So, yeah,
[424:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[424:30] you know, for for f.
[424:32] It was called f.
[424:34] It was just called f the executable.
[424:38] So you'd have f and again,
[424:40] yeah, you had f.
[424:42] You had solc.
[424:44] You had
[424:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[424:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[424:50] Acute client.
[424:52] You had,
[424:53] which was the gooey miner.
[424:56] Yeah.
[424:57] That's right.
[424:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[425:05] And then you had one,
[425:07] which was sort of
[425:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[425:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[425:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[425:19] You're running a node,
[425:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[425:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[425:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[425:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[425:41] That's a lot.
[425:43] That that was a lot.
[425:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[425:52] Right?
[425:54] Right.
[425:55] Right.
[425:56] Right.
[425:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[426:00] I mean, when I started,
[426:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[426:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[426:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[426:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[426:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[426:20] Yeah.
[426:22] Dev p two p.
[426:23] Live p two p.
[426:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[426:29] documentation all over the place.
[426:31] I mean You know?
[426:33] I think, you know,
[426:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[426:45] it's like, right.
[426:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[426:51] Right?
[426:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[426:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[427:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[427:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[427:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[427:19] There was no
[427:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[427:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[427:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[427:32] So it's like, right.
[427:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[427:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[427:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[427:50] So yeah,
[427:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[427:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[428:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[428:07] and specifically
[428:09] decoupling
[428:10] and the tests from the client.
[428:14] Right?
[428:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[428:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[428:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[428:32] compiling QT,
[428:35] all of this stuff.
[428:37] So just to get you know?
[428:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[428:44] for Solsea either.
[428:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[428:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[428:55] You have to do all of that.
[428:57] So I remember,
[429:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[429:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[429:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[429:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[429:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[429:20] This is not great.
[429:22] It was my benefit.
[429:25] It's amazing.
[429:27] But, yeah,
[429:28] it was,
[429:30] yeah,
[429:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[429:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[429:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[429:41] coming back,
[429:42] looking at it,
[429:44] saying, like, this can't be
[429:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[429:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[430:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[430:07] you know, but you're right.
[430:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[430:14] You know, talking about that,
[430:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[430:21] and everything.
[430:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[430:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[430:32] because that seems,
[430:34] you know, in an organized way.
[430:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[430:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[430:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[430:45] You know, things as simple as,
[430:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[430:50] like, technical
[430:51] leads that actually lead?
[430:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[430:58] Have we got any IT ?
[431:00] Have we got
[431:02] anything?
[431:03] And it's like, no.
[431:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[431:09] And
[431:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[431:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[431:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[431:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[431:29] Right?
[431:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[431:35] Yeah.
[431:36] You know,
[431:38] I I
[431:39] alright.
[431:42] Okay.
[431:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[431:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[431:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[431:55] but it was kind of similar.
[431:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[432:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[432:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[432:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[432:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[432:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[432:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[432:37] And but it's, I think,
[432:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[432:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[432:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[432:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[433:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[433:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[433:09] Yeah.
[433:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[433:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[433:18] I was finding these the other day.
[433:21] I was finding the first commits
[433:24] for PyEthereum,
[433:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[433:33] and Go Ethereum.
[433:36] And they were all
[433:37] I think they were all November or December.
[433:41] I think they were all 2013,
[433:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[433:47] Yeah.
[433:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[433:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[433:56] But, you know, that was
[433:58] Yeah.
[433:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[434:03] Right?
[434:04] Yeah.
[434:05] We were much later.
[434:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[434:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[434:13] Yeah.
[434:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[434:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[434:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[434:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[434:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[434:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[434:36] September, October, something like that,
[434:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[434:46] More Jim than me.
[434:48] But so yeah,
[434:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[434:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[434:57] Yep.
[435:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[435:03] Right?
[435:04] I think probably
[435:06] they could have
[435:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[435:14] doing any hedging.
[435:17] And then later,
[435:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[435:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[435:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[435:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[435:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[435:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[435:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[436:03] get people to fight over it,
[436:06] but
[436:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[436:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[436:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[436:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[436:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[436:28] that was the whole world.
[436:30] Right?
[436:31] You know, that was everything,
[436:34] right, was several months
[436:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[436:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[436:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[436:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[436:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[436:55] sorry, 2013.
[437:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[437:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[437:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[437:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[437:20] going on.
[437:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[437:27] so just three further days.
[437:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[437:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[437:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[437:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[437:52] So,
[437:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[438:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[438:03] Oh,
[438:04] sorry.
[438:05] You
[438:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[438:11] Right?
[438:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[438:17] you had,
[438:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[438:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[438:26] Yeah.
[438:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[438:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[438:38] But
[438:39] then, yeah,
[438:40] following that,
[438:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[438:45] onto those teams.
[438:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[438:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[439:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[439:03] And then you
[439:05] and then you guys starting
[439:06] whenever you were starting.
[439:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[439:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[439:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[439:23] and you basically did have a major,
[439:27] you know,
[439:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[439:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[439:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[439:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[439:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[439:48] And then it's like, right.
[439:51] Sorry.
[439:52] You're out,
[439:54] and you're not getting any money.
[439:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[440:00] Yes.
[440:01] Do you
[440:02] so my memory
[440:04] around the C++ client was that
[440:06] there were funds to
[440:08] do a security audit
[440:10] for
[440:11] two clients,
[440:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[440:17] Right?
[440:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[440:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[440:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[440:33] I'm not they sure did.
[440:37] You know?
[440:38] You know mean?
[440:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[440:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[440:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[440:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[440:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[441:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[441:11] mid 2015,
[441:12] it's like,
[441:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[441:19] And then
[441:20] that's what happened.
[441:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[441:24] I mean,
[441:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[441:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[441:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[441:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[441:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[441:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[441:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[441:56] as a client,
[441:57] like, died,
[442:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[442:06] It's like, right.
[442:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[442:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[442:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[442:26] across solc,
[442:28] the tests,
[442:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[442:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[442:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[442:48] but
[442:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[442:53] Right?
[442:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[442:58] He was he was building that client.
[443:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[443:05] He was,
[443:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[443:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[443:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[443:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[443:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[443:27] Right?
[443:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[443:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[443:34] closer with Mist,
[443:37] you know, with on Mist.
[443:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[443:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[443:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[443:51] But but, yeah,
[443:53] that would make sense.
[443:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[443:59] And and
[444:00] wait.
[444:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[444:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[444:08] Yeah.
[444:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[444:13] But yeah.
[444:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[444:17] Okay.
[444:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[444:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[444:22] Yes.
[444:23] So, yeah,
[444:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[444:30] you know, for for f.
[444:32] It was called f.
[444:34] It was just called f the executable.
[444:38] So you'd have f and again,
[444:40] yeah, you had f.
[444:42] You had solc.
[444:44] You had
[444:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[444:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[444:50] Acute client.
[444:52] You had,
[444:53] which was the gooey miner.
[444:56] Yeah.
[444:57] That's right.
[444:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[445:05] And then you had one,
[445:07] which was sort of
[445:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[445:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[445:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[445:19] You're running a node,
[445:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[445:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[445:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[445:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[445:41] That's a lot.
[445:43] That that was a lot.
[445:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[445:52] Right?
[445:54] Right.
[445:55] Right.
[445:56] Right.
[445:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[446:00] I mean, when I started,
[446:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[446:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[446:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[446:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[446:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[446:20] Yeah.
[446:22] Dev p two p.
[446:23] Live p two p.
[446:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[446:29] documentation all over the place.
[446:31] I mean You know?
[446:33] I think, you know,
[446:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[446:45] it's like, right.
[446:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[446:51] Right?
[446:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[446:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[447:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[447:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[447:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[447:19] There was no
[447:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[447:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[447:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[447:32] So it's like, right.
[447:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[447:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[447:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[447:50] So yeah,
[447:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[447:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[448:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[448:07] and specifically
[448:09] decoupling
[448:10] and the tests from the client.
[448:14] Right?
[448:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[448:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[448:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[448:32] compiling QT,
[448:35] all of this stuff.
[448:37] So just to get you know?
[448:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[448:44] for Solsea either.
[448:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[448:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[448:55] You have to do all of that.
[448:57] So I remember,
[449:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[449:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[449:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[449:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[449:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[449:20] This is not great.
[449:22] It was my benefit.
[449:25] It's amazing.
[449:27] But, yeah,
[449:28] it was,
[449:30] yeah,
[449:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[449:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[449:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[449:41] coming back,
[449:42] looking at it,
[449:44] saying, like, this can't be
[449:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[449:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[450:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[450:07] you know, but you're right.
[450:09] It's just like

[450:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated

[450:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[450:32] because that seems,
[450:34] you know, in an organized way.
[450:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[450:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[450:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[450:45] You know, things as simple as,
[450:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[450:50] like, technical
[450:51] leads that actually lead?
[450:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[450:58] Have we got any IT ?
[451:00] Have we got
[451:02] anything?
[451:03] And it's like, no.
[451:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[451:09] And
[451:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[451:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[451:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[451:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[451:29] Right?
[451:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[451:35] Yeah.
[451:36] You know,
[451:38] I I
[451:39] alright.
[451:42] Okay.
[451:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[451:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[451:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,

[453:21] I was finding the first commits
[453:24] for PyEthereum,
[453:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[453:33] and Go Ethereum.
[453:36] And they were all
[453:37] I think they were all November or December.
[453:41] I think they were all 2013,
[453:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[453:47] Yeah.
[453:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[453:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[453:56] But, you know, that was
[453:58] Yeah.
[453:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[454:03] Right?
[454:04] Yeah.
[454:05] We were much later.
[454:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[454:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[454:13] Yeah.
[454:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[454:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[454:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[454:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[454:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[454:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[454:36] September, October, something like that,
[454:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[454:46] More Jim than me.
[454:48] But so yeah,
[454:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[454:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[454:57] Yep.
[455:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[455:03] Right?
[455:04] I think probably
[455:06] they could have
[455:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[455:14] doing any hedging.
[455:17] And then later,
[455:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[455:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[455:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[455:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[455:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[455:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[455:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[456:03] get people to fight over it,
[456:06] but
[456:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[456:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[456:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[456:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[456:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[456:28] that was the whole world.
[456:30] Right?
[456:31] You know, that was everything,
[456:34] right, was several months
[456:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[456:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[456:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[456:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[456:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[456:55] sorry, 2013.
[457:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[457:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[457:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[457:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[457:20] going on.
[457:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[457:27] so just three further days.
[457:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[457:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[457:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[457:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[457:52] So,
[457:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[458:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[458:03] Oh,
[458:04] sorry.
[458:05] You
[458:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[458:11] Right?
[458:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[458:17] you had,
[458:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[458:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[458:26] Yeah.
[458:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[458:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[458:38] But
[458:39] then, yeah,
[458:40] following that,
[458:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[458:45] onto those teams.
[458:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[458:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[459:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[459:03] And then you
[459:05] and then you guys starting
[459:06] whenever you were starting.
[459:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[459:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[459:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[459:23] and you basically did have a major,
[459:27] you know,
[459:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[459:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[459:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[459:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[459:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[459:48] And then it's like, right.
[459:51] Sorry.
[459:52] You're out,
[459:54] and you're not getting any money.
[459:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[460:00] Yes.
[460:01] Do you
[460:02] so my memory
[460:04] around the C++ client was that
[460:06] there were funds to
[460:08] do a security audit
[460:10] for
[460:11] two clients,
[460:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[460:17] Right?
[460:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[460:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[460:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[460:33] I'm not they sure did.
[460:37] You know?
[460:38] You know mean?
[460:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[460:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[460:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[460:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[460:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[461:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[461:11] mid 2015,
[461:12] it's like,
[461:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[461:19] And then
[461:20] that's what happened.
[461:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[461:24] I mean,
[461:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[461:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[461:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[461:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[461:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[461:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[461:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[461:56] as a client,
[461:57] like, died,
[462:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[462:06] It's like, right.
[462:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[462:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[462:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[462:26] across solc,
[462:28] the tests,
[462:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[462:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[462:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[462:48] but
[462:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[462:53] Right?
[462:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[462:58] He was he was building that client.
[463:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[463:05] He was,
[463:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[463:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[463:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[463:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[463:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[463:27] Right?
[463:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[463:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[463:34] closer with Mist,
[463:37] you know, with on Mist.
[463:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[463:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[463:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[463:51] But but, yeah,
[463:53] that would make sense.
[463:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[463:59] And and
[464:00] wait.
[464:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[464:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[464:08] Yeah.
[464:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[464:13] But yeah.
[464:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[464:17] Okay.
[464:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[464:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[464:22] Yes.
[464:23] So, yeah,
[464:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[464:30] you know, for for f.
[464:32] It was called f.
[464:34] It was just called f the executable.
[464:38] So you'd have f and again,
[464:40] yeah, you had f.
[464:42] You had solc.
[464:44] You had
[464:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[464:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[464:50] Acute client.
[464:52] You had,
[464:53] which was the gooey miner.
[464:56] Yeah.
[464:57] That's right.
[464:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[465:05] And then you had one,
[465:07] which was sort of
[465:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[465:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[465:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[465:19] You're running a node,
[465:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[465:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[465:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[465:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[465:41] That's a lot.
[465:43] That that was a lot.
[465:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[465:52] Right?
[465:54] Right.
[465:55] Right.
[465:56] Right.
[465:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[466:00] I mean, when I started,
[466:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[466:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[466:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[466:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[466:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[466:20] Yeah.
[466:22] Dev p two p.
[466:23] Live p two p.
[466:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[466:29] documentation all over the place.
[466:31] I mean You know?
[466:33] I think, you know,
[466:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[466:45] it's like, right.
[466:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[466:51] Right?
[466:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[466:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[467:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[467:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[467:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[467:19] There was no
[467:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[467:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[467:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[467:32] So it's like, right.
[467:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[467:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[467:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[467:50] So yeah,
[467:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[467:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[468:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[468:07] and specifically
[468:09] decoupling
[468:10] and the tests from the client.
[468:14] Right?
[468:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[468:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[468:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[468:32] compiling QT,
[468:35] all of this stuff.
[468:37] So just to get you know?
[468:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[468:44] for Solsea either.
[468:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[468:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[468:55] You have to do all of that.
[468:57] So I remember,
[469:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[469:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[469:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[469:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[469:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[469:20] This is not great.
[469:22] It was my benefit.
[469:25] It's amazing.
[469:27] But, yeah,
[469:28] it was,
[469:30] yeah,
[469:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[469:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[469:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[469:41] coming back,
[469:42] looking at it,
[469:44] saying, like, this can't be
[469:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[469:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[470:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[470:07] you know, but you're right.
[470:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[470:14] You know, talking about that,
[470:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[470:21] and everything.
[470:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[470:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[470:32] because that seems,
[470:34] you know, in an organized way.
[470:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[470:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[470:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[470:45] You know, things as simple as,
[470:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[470:50] like, technical
[470:51] leads that actually lead?
[470:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[470:58] Have we got any IT ?
[471:00] Have we got
[471:02] anything?
[471:03] And it's like, no.
[471:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[471:09] And
[471:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[471:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[471:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[471:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[471:29] Right?
[471:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[471:35] Yeah.
[471:36] You know,
[471:38] I I
[471:39] alright.
[471:42] Okay.
[471:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[471:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[471:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[471:55] but it was kind of similar.
[471:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[472:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[472:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[472:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[472:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[472:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[472:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[472:37] And but it's, I think,
[472:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[472:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[472:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[472:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[473:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[473:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[473:09] Yeah.
[473:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[473:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[473:18] I was finding these the other day.
[473:21] I was finding the first commits
[473:24] for PyEthereum,
[473:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[473:33] and Go Ethereum.
[473:36] And they were all
[473:37] I think they were all November or December.
[473:41] I think they were all 2013,
[473:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[473:47] Yeah.
[473:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[473:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[473:56] But, you know, that was
[473:58] Yeah.
[473:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[474:03] Right?
[474:04] Yeah.
[474:05] We were much later.
[474:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[474:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[474:13] Yeah.
[474:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[474:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[474:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[474:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[474:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[474:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[474:36] September, October, something like that,
[474:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[474:46] More Jim than me.
[474:48] But so yeah,
[474:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[474:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[474:57] Yep.
[475:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[475:03] Right?
[475:04] I think probably
[475:06] they could have
[475:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[475:14] doing any hedging.
[475:17] And then later,
[475:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[475:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[475:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[475:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[475:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[475:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[475:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[476:03] get people to fight over it,
[476:06] but
[476:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[476:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[476:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[476:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[476:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[476:28] that was the whole world.
[476:30] Right?
[476:31] You know, that was everything,
[476:34] right, was several months
[476:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[476:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[476:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[476:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[476:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[476:55] sorry, 2013.
[477:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[477:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[477:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[477:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[477:20] going on.
[477:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[477:27] so just three further days.
[477:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[477:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[477:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[477:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[477:52] So,
[477:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[478:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[478:03] Oh,
[478:04] sorry.
[478:05] You
[478:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[478:11] Right?
[478:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[478:17] you had,
[478:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[478:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[478:26] Yeah.
[478:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[478:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[478:38] But
[478:39] then, yeah,
[478:40] following that,
[478:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[478:45] onto those teams.
[478:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[478:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[479:00] you know, that that never got funded.
[479:03] And then you
[479:05] and then you guys starting
[479:06] whenever you were starting.
[479:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[479:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[479:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[479:23] and you basically did have a major,
[479:27] you know,
[479:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[479:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[479:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[479:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[479:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[479:48] And then it's like, right.
[479:51] Sorry.
[479:52] You're out,
[479:54] and you're not getting any money.
[479:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[480:00] Yes.
[480:01] Do you
[480:02] so my memory
[480:04] around the C++ client was that
[480:06] there were funds to
[480:08] do a security audit
[480:10] for
[480:11] two clients,
[480:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[480:17] Right?
[480:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[480:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[480:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[480:33] I'm not they sure did.
[480:37] You know?
[480:38] You know mean?
[480:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[480:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[480:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[480:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[480:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[481:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[481:11] mid 2015,
[481:12] it's like,
[481:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[481:19] And then
[481:20] that's what happened.
[481:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[481:24] I mean,
[481:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[481:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[481:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[481:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[481:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[481:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[481:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[481:56] as a client,
[481:57] like, died,
[482:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[482:06] It's like, right.
[482:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[482:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[482:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[482:26] across solc,
[482:28] the tests,
[482:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[482:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[482:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[482:48] but
[482:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[482:53] Right?
[482:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[482:58] He was he was building that client.
[483:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[483:05] He was,
[483:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[483:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[483:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[483:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[483:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[483:27] Right?
[483:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[483:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[483:34] closer with Mist,
[483:37] you know, with on Mist.
[483:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[483:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[483:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[483:51] But but, yeah,
[483:53] that would make sense.
[483:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[483:59] And and
[484:00] wait.
[484:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[484:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[484:08] Yeah.
[484:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[484:13] But yeah.
[484:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[484:17] Okay.
[484:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[484:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[484:22] Yes.
[484:23] So, yeah,
[484:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[484:30] you know, for for f.
[484:32] It was called f.
[484:34] It was just called f the executable.
[484:38] So you'd have f and again,
[484:40] yeah, you had f.
[484:42] You had solc.
[484:44] You had
[484:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[484:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[484:50] Acute client.
[484:52] You had,
[484:53] which was the gooey miner.
[484:56] Yeah.
[484:57] That's right.
[484:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[485:05] And then you had one,
[485:07] which was sort of
[485:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[485:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[485:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[485:19] You're running a node,
[485:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[485:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[485:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[485:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[485:41] That's a lot.
[485:43] That that was a lot.
[485:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[485:52] Right?
[485:54] Right.
[485:55] Right.
[485:56] Right.
[485:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[486:00] I mean, when I started,
[486:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[486:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[486:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[486:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[486:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[486:20] Yeah.
[486:22] Dev p two p.
[486:23] Live p two p.
[486:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[486:29] documentation all over the place.
[486:31] I mean You know?
[486:33] I think, you know,
[486:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[486:45] it's like, right.
[486:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[486:51] Right?
[486:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[486:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[487:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[487:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[487:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[487:19] There was no
[487:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[487:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[487:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[487:32] So it's like, right.
[487:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[487:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[487:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[487:50] So yeah,
[487:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[487:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[488:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[488:07] and specifically
[488:09] decoupling
[488:10] and the tests from the client.
[488:14] Right?
[488:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[488:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[488:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[488:32] compiling QT,
[488:35] all of this stuff.
[488:37] So just to get you know?
[488:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[488:44] for Solsea either.
[488:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[488:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[488:55] You have to do all of that.
[488:57] So I remember,
[489:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[489:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[489:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[489:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[489:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[489:20] This is not great.
[489:22] It was my benefit.
[489:25] It's amazing.
[489:27] But, yeah,
[489:28] it was,
[489:30] yeah,
[489:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[489:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[489:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[489:41] coming back,
[489:42] looking at it,
[489:44] saying, like, this can't be
[489:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[489:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[490:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[490:07] you know, but you're right.
[490:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[490:14] You know, talking about that,
[490:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[490:21] and everything.
[490:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[490:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[490:32] because that seems,
[490:34] you know, in an organized way.
[490:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[490:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[490:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[490:45] You know, things as simple as,
[490:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[490:50] like, technical
[490:51] leads that actually lead?
[490:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[490:58] Have we got any IT ?
[491:00] Have we got
[491:02] anything?
[491:03] And it's like, no.
[491:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[491:09] And
[491:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[491:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[491:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[491:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[491:29] Right?
[491:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[491:35] Yeah.
[491:36] You know,
[491:38] I I
[491:39] alright.
[491:42] Okay.
[491:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[491:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[491:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[491:55] but it was kind of similar.
[491:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[492:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[492:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[492:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[492:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[492:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[492:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[492:37] And but it's, I think,
[492:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[492:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[492:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[492:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[493:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[493:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[493:09] Yeah.
[493:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[493:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[493:18] I was finding these the other day.
[493:21] I was finding the first commits
[493:24] for PyEthereum,
[493:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[493:33] and Go Ethereum.
[493:36] And they were all
[493:37] I think they were all November or December.
[493:41] I think they were all 2013,
[493:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[493:47] Yeah.
[493:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[493:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[493:56] But, you know, that was
[493:58] Yeah.
[493:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[494:03] Right?
[494:04] Yeah.
[494:05] We were much later.
[494:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[494:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[494:13] Yeah.
[494:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[494:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[494:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[494:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[494:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[494:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[494:36] September, October, something like that,
[494:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[494:46] More Jim than me.
[494:48] But so yeah,
[494:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[494:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[494:57] Yep.
[495:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[495:03] Right?
[495:04] I think probably
[495:06] they could have
[495:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[495:14] doing any hedging.
[495:17] And then later,
[495:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[495:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[495:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[495:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[495:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[495:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[495:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[496:03] get people to fight over it,
[496:06] but
[496:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[496:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[496:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[496:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[496:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[496:28] that was the whole world.
[496:30] Right?
[496:31] You know, that was everything,
[496:34] right, was several months
[496:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[496:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[496:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[496:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[496:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[496:55] sorry, 2013.
[497:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[497:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[497:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[497:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[497:20] going on.
[497:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[497:27] so just three further days.
[497:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[497:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[497:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[497:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[497:52] So,
[497:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[498:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[498:03] Oh,
[498:04] sorry.
[498:05] You
[498:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[498:11] Right?
[498:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[498:17] you had,
[498:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[498:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[498:26] Yeah.
[498:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[498:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[498:38] But
[498:39] then, yeah,
[498:40] following that,
[498:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[498:45] onto those teams.
[498:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[498:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[498:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[499:02] And then you
[499:04] and then you guys starting
[499:06] whenever you were starting.
[499:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[499:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[499:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[499:23] and you basically did have a major,
[499:27] you know,
[499:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[499:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[499:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[499:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[499:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[499:48] And then it's like, right.
[499:51] Sorry.
[499:52] You're out,
[499:54] and you're not getting any money.
[499:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[500:00] Yes.
[500:01] Do you
[500:02] so my memory
[500:04] around the C++ client was that
[500:06] there were funds to
[500:08] do a security audit
[500:10] for
[500:11] two clients,
[500:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[500:17] Right?
[500:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[500:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[500:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[500:33] I'm not they sure did.
[500:37] You know?
[500:38] You know mean?
[500:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[500:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[500:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[500:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[500:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[501:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[501:11] mid 2015,
[501:12] it's like,
[501:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[501:19] And then
[501:20] that's what happened.
[501:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[501:24] I mean,
[501:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[501:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[501:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[501:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[501:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[501:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[501:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[501:56] as a client,
[501:57] like, died,
[502:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[502:06] It's like, right.
[502:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[502:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[502:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[502:26] across solc,
[502:28] the tests,
[502:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[502:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[502:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[502:48] but
[502:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[502:53] Right?
[502:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[502:58] He was he was building that client.
[503:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[503:05] He was,
[503:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[503:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[503:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[503:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[503:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[503:27] Right?
[503:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[503:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[503:34] closer with Mist,
[503:37] you know, with on Mist.
[503:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[503:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[503:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[503:51] But but, yeah,
[503:53] that would make sense.
[503:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[503:59] And and
[504:00] wait.
[504:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[504:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[504:08] Yeah.
[504:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[504:13] But yeah.
[504:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[504:17] Okay.
[504:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[504:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[504:22] Yes.
[504:23] So, yeah,
[504:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[504:30] you know, for for f.
[504:32] It was called f.
[504:34] It was just called f the executable.
[504:38] So you'd have f and again,
[504:40] yeah, you had f.
[504:42] You had solc.
[504:44] You had
[504:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[504:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[504:50] Acute client.
[504:52] You had,
[504:53] which was the gooey miner.
[504:56] Yeah.
[504:57] That's right.
[504:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[505:05] And then you had one,
[505:07] which was sort of
[505:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[505:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[505:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[505:19] You're running a node,
[505:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[505:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[505:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[505:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[505:41] That's a lot.
[505:43] That that was a lot.
[505:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[505:52] Right?
[505:54] Right.
[505:55] Right.
[505:56] Right.
[505:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[506:00] I mean, when I started,
[506:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[506:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[506:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[506:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[506:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[506:20] Yeah.
[506:22] Dev p two p.
[506:23] Live p two p.
[506:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[506:29] documentation all over the place.
[506:31] I mean You know?
[506:33] I think, you know,
[506:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[506:45] it's like, right.
[506:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[506:51] Right?
[506:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[506:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[507:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[507:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[507:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[507:19] There was no
[507:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[507:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[507:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[507:32] So it's like, right.
[507:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[507:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[507:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[507:50] So yeah,
[507:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[507:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[508:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[508:07] and specifically
[508:09] decoupling
[508:10] and the tests from the client.
[508:14] Right?
[508:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[508:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[508:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[508:32] compiling QT,
[508:35] all of this stuff.
[508:37] So just to get you know?
[508:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[508:44] for Solsea either.
[508:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[508:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[508:55] You have to do all of that.
[508:57] So I remember,
[509:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[509:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[509:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[509:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[509:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[509:20] This is not great.
[509:22] It was my benefit.
[509:25] It's amazing.
[509:27] But, yeah,
[509:28] it was,
[509:30] yeah,
[509:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[509:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[509:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[509:41] coming back,
[509:42] looking at it,
[509:44] saying, like, this can't be
[509:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[509:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[510:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[510:07] you know, but you're right.
[510:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[510:14] You know, talking about that,
[510:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[510:21] and everything.
[510:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[510:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[510:32] because that seems,
[510:34] you know, in an organized way.
[510:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[510:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[510:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[510:45] You know, things as simple as,
[510:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[510:50] like, technical
[510:51] leads that actually lead?
[510:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[510:58] Have we got any IT ?
[511:00] Have we got
[511:02] anything?
[511:03] And it's like, no.
[511:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[511:09] And
[511:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[511:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[511:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[511:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[511:29] Right?
[511:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[511:35] Yeah.
[511:36] You know,
[511:38] I I
[511:39] alright.
[511:42] Okay.
[511:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[511:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[511:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[511:55] but it was kind of similar.
[511:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[512:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[512:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[512:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[512:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[512:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[512:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[512:37] And but it's, I think,
[512:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[512:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[512:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[512:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[513:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[513:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[513:09] Yeah.
[513:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[513:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[513:18] I was finding these the other day.
[513:21] I was finding the first commits
[513:24] for PyEthereum,
[513:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[513:33] and Go Ethereum.
[513:36] And they were all
[513:37] I think they were all November or December.
[513:41] I think they were all 2013,
[513:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[513:47] Yeah.
[513:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[513:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[513:56] But, you know, that was
[513:58] Yeah.
[513:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[514:03] Right?
[514:04] Yeah.
[514:05] We were much later.
[514:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[514:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[514:13] Yeah.
[514:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[514:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[514:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[514:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[514:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[514:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[514:36] September, October, something like that,
[514:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[514:46] More Jim than me.
[514:48] But so yeah,
[514:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[514:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[514:57] Yep.
[515:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[515:03] Right?
[515:04] I think probably
[515:06] they could have
[515:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[515:14] doing any hedging.
[515:17] And then later,
[515:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[515:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[515:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[515:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[515:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[515:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[515:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[516:03] get people to fight over it,
[516:06] but
[516:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[516:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[516:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[516:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[516:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[516:28] that was the whole world.
[516:30] Right?
[516:31] You know, that was everything,
[516:34] right, was several months
[516:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[516:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[516:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[516:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[516:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[516:55] sorry, 2013.
[517:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[517:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[517:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[517:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[517:20] going on.
[517:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[517:27] so just three further days.
[517:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[517:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[517:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[517:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[517:52] So,
[517:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[518:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[518:03] Oh,
[518:04] sorry.
[518:05] You
[518:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[518:11] Right?
[518:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[518:17] you had,
[518:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[518:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[518:26] Yeah.
[518:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[518:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[518:38] But
[518:39] then, yeah,
[518:40] following that,
[518:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[518:45] onto those teams.
[518:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[518:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[518:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[519:02] And then you
[519:04] and then you guys starting
[519:06] whenever you were starting.
[519:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[519:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[519:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[519:23] and you basically did have a major,
[519:27] you know,
[519:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[519:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[519:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[519:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[519:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[519:48] And then it's like, right.
[519:51] Sorry.
[519:52] You're out,
[519:54] and you're not getting any money.
[519:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[520:00] Yes.
[520:01] Do you
[520:02] so my memory
[520:04] around the C++ client was that
[520:06] there were funds to
[520:08] do a security audit
[520:10] for
[520:11] two clients,
[520:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[520:17] Right?
[520:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[520:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[520:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[520:33] I'm not they sure did.
[520:37] You know?
[520:38] You know mean?
[520:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[520:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[520:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[520:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[520:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[521:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[521:11] mid 2015,
[521:12] it's like,
[521:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[521:19] And then
[521:20] that's what happened.
[521:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[521:24] I mean,
[521:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[521:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[521:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[521:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[521:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[521:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[521:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[521:56] as a client,
[521:57] like, died,
[522:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[522:06] It's like, right.
[522:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[522:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[522:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[522:26] across solc,
[522:28] the tests,
[522:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[522:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[522:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[522:48] but
[522:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[522:53] Right?
[522:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[522:58] He was he was building that client.
[523:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[523:05] He was,
[523:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[523:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[523:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[523:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[523:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[523:27] Right?
[523:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[523:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[523:34] closer with Mist,
[523:37] you know, with on Mist.
[523:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[523:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[523:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[523:51] But but, yeah,
[523:53] that would make sense.
[523:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[523:59] And and
[524:00] wait.
[524:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[524:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[524:08] Yeah.
[524:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[524:13] But yeah.
[524:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[524:17] Okay.
[524:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[524:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[524:22] Yes.
[524:23] So, yeah,
[524:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[524:30] you know, for for f.
[524:32] It was called f.
[524:34] It was just called f the executable.
[524:38] So you'd have f and again,
[524:40] yeah, you had f.
[524:42] You had solc.
[524:44] You had
[524:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[524:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[524:50] Acute client.
[524:52] You had,
[524:53] which was the gooey miner.
[524:56] Yeah.
[524:57] That's right.
[524:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[525:05] And then you had one,
[525:07] which was sort of
[525:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[525:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[525:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[525:19] You're running a node,
[525:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[525:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[525:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[525:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[525:41] That's a lot.
[525:43] That that was a lot.
[525:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[525:52] Right?
[525:54] Right.
[525:55] Right.
[525:56] Right.
[525:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[526:00] I mean, when I started,
[526:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[526:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[526:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[526:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[526:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[526:20] Yeah.
[526:22] Dev p two p.
[526:23] Live p two p.
[526:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[526:29] documentation all over the place.
[526:31] I mean You know?
[526:33] I think, you know,
[526:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[526:45] it's like, right.
[526:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[526:51] Right?
[526:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[526:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[527:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[527:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[527:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[527:19] There was no
[527:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[527:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[527:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[527:32] So it's like, right.
[527:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[527:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[527:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[527:50] So yeah,
[527:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[527:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[528:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[528:07] and specifically
[528:09] decoupling
[528:10] and the tests from the client.
[528:14] Right?
[528:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[528:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[528:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[528:32] compiling QT,
[528:35] all of this stuff.
[528:37] So just to get you know?
[528:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[528:44] for Solsea either.
[528:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[528:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[528:55] You have to do all of that.
[528:57] So I remember,
[529:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[529:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[529:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[529:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[529:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[529:20] This is not great.
[529:22] It was my benefit.
[529:25] It's amazing.
[529:27] But, yeah,
[529:28] it was,
[529:30] yeah,
[529:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[529:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[529:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[529:41] coming back,
[529:42] looking at it,
[529:44] saying, like, this can't be
[529:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[529:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[530:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[530:07] you know, but you're right.
[530:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[530:14] You know, talking about that,
[530:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[530:21] and everything.
[530:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[530:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[530:32] because that seems,
[530:34] you know, in an organized way.
[530:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[530:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[530:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[530:45] You know, things as simple as,
[530:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[530:50] like, technical
[530:51] leads that actually lead?
[530:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[530:58] Have we got any IT ?
[531:00] Have we got
[531:02] anything?
[531:03] And it's like, no.
[531:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[531:09] And
[531:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[531:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[531:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[531:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[531:29] Right?
[531:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[531:35] Yeah.
[531:36] You know,
[531:38] I I
[531:39] alright.
[531:42] Okay.
[531:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[531:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[531:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[531:55] but it was kind of similar.
[531:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[532:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[532:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[532:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[532:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[532:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[532:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[532:37] And but it's, I think,
[532:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[532:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[532:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[532:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[533:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[533:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[533:09] Yeah.
[533:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[533:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[533:18] I was finding these the other day.
[533:21] I was finding the first commits
[533:24] for PyEthereum,
[533:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[533:33] and Go Ethereum.
[533:36] And they were all
[533:37] I think they were all November or December.
[533:41] I think they were all 2013,
[533:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[533:47] Yeah.
[533:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[533:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[533:56] But, you know, that was
[533:58] Yeah.
[533:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[534:03] Right?
[534:04] Yeah.
[534:05] We were much later.
[534:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[534:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[534:13] Yeah.
[534:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[534:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[534:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[534:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[534:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[534:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[534:36] September, October, something like that,
[534:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[534:46] More Jim than me.
[534:48] But so yeah,
[534:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[534:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[534:57] Yep.
[535:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[535:03] Right?
[535:04] I think probably
[535:06] they could have
[535:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[535:14] doing any hedging.
[535:17] And then later,
[535:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[535:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[535:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[535:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[535:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[535:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[535:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[536:03] get people to fight over it,
[536:06] but
[536:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[536:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[536:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[536:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[536:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[536:28] that was the whole world.
[536:30] Right?
[536:31] You know, that was everything,
[536:34] right, was several months
[536:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[536:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[536:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[536:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[536:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[536:55] sorry, 2013.
[537:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[537:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[537:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[537:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[537:20] going on.
[537:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[537:27] so just three further days.
[537:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[537:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[537:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[537:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[537:52] So,
[537:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[538:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[538:03] Oh,
[538:04] sorry.
[538:05] You
[538:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[538:11] Right?
[538:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[538:17] you had,
[538:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[538:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[538:26] Yeah.
[538:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[538:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[538:38] But
[538:39] then, yeah,
[538:40] following that,
[538:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[538:45] onto those teams.
[538:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[538:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[538:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[539:02] And then you
[539:04] and then you guys starting
[539:06] whenever you were starting.
[539:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[539:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[539:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[539:23] and you basically did have a major,
[539:27] you know,
[539:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[539:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[539:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[539:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[539:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[539:48] And then it's like, right.
[539:51] Sorry.
[539:52] You're out,
[539:54] and you're not getting any money.
[539:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[540:00] Yes.
[540:01] Do you
[540:02] so my memory
[540:04] around the C++ client was that
[540:06] there were funds to
[540:08] do a security audit
[540:10] for
[540:11] two clients,
[540:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[540:17] Right?
[540:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[540:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[540:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[540:33] I'm not they sure did.
[540:37] You know?
[540:38] You know mean?
[540:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[540:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[540:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[540:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[540:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[541:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[541:11] mid 2015,
[541:12] it's like,
[541:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[541:19] And then
[541:20] that's what happened.
[541:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[541:24] I mean,
[541:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[541:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[541:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[541:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[541:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[541:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[541:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[541:56] as a client,
[541:57] like, died,
[542:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[542:06] It's like, right.
[542:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[542:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[542:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[542:26] across solc,
[542:28] the tests,
[542:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[542:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[542:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[542:48] but
[542:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[542:53] Right?
[542:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[542:58] He was he was building that client.
[543:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[543:05] He was,
[543:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[543:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[543:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[543:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[543:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[543:27] Right?
[543:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[543:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[543:34] closer with Mist,
[543:37] you know, with on Mist.
[543:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[543:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[543:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[543:51] But but, yeah,
[543:53] that would make sense.
[543:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[543:59] And and
[544:00] wait.
[544:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[544:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[544:08] Yeah.
[544:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[544:13] But yeah.
[544:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[544:17] Okay.
[544:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[544:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[544:22] Yes.
[544:23] So, yeah,
[544:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[544:30] you know, for for f.
[544:32] It was called f.
[544:34] It was just called f the executable.
[544:38] So you'd have f and again,
[544:40] yeah, you had f.
[544:42] You had solc.
[544:44] You had
[544:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[544:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[544:50] Acute client.
[544:52] You had,
[544:53] which was the gooey miner.
[544:56] Yeah.
[544:57] That's right.
[544:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[545:05] And then you had one,
[545:07] which was sort of
[545:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[545:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[545:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[545:19] You're running a node,
[545:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[545:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[545:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[545:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[545:41] That's a lot.
[545:43] That that was a lot.
[545:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[545:52] Right?
[545:54] Right.
[545:55] Right.
[545:56] Right.
[545:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[546:00] I mean, when I started,
[546:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[546:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[546:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[546:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[546:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[546:20] Yeah.
[546:22] Dev p two p.
[546:23] Live p two p.
[546:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[546:29] documentation all over the place.
[546:31] I mean You know?
[546:33] I think, you know,
[546:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[546:45] it's like, right.
[546:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[546:51] Right?
[546:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[546:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[547:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[547:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[547:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[547:19] There was no
[547:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[547:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[547:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[547:32] So it's like, right.
[547:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[547:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[547:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[547:50] So yeah,
[547:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[547:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[548:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[548:07] and specifically
[548:09] decoupling
[548:10] and the tests from the client.
[548:14] Right?
[548:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[548:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[548:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[548:32] compiling QT,
[548:35] all of this stuff.
[548:37] So just to get you know?
[548:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[548:44] for Solsea either.
[548:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[548:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[548:55] You have to do all of that.
[548:57] So I remember,
[549:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[549:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[549:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[549:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[549:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[549:20] This is not great.
[549:22] It was my benefit.
[549:25] It's amazing.
[549:27] But, yeah,
[549:28] it was,
[549:30] yeah,
[549:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[549:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[549:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[549:41] coming back,
[549:42] looking at it,
[549:44] saying, like, this can't be
[549:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[549:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[550:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[550:07] you know, but you're right.
[550:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[550:14] You know, talking about that,
[550:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[550:21] and everything.
[550:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[550:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[550:32] because that seems,
[550:34] you know, in an organized way.
[550:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[550:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[550:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[550:45] You know, things as simple as,
[550:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[550:50] like, technical
[550:51] leads that actually lead?
[550:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[550:58] Have we got any IT ?
[551:00] Have we got
[551:02] anything?
[551:03] And it's like, no.
[551:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[551:09] And
[551:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[551:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[551:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[551:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[551:29] Right?
[551:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[551:35] Yeah.
[551:36] You know,
[551:38] I I
[551:39] alright.
[551:42] Okay.
[551:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[551:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[551:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[551:55] but it was kind of similar.
[551:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[552:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[552:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[552:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[552:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[552:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[552:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[552:37] And but it's, I think,
[552:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[552:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[552:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[552:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[553:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[553:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[553:09] Yeah.
[553:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[553:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[553:18] I was finding these the other day.
[553:21] I was finding the first commits
[553:24] for PyEthereum,
[553:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[553:33] and Go Ethereum.
[553:36] And they were all
[553:37] I think they were all November or December.
[553:41] I think they were all 2013,
[553:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[553:47] Yeah.
[553:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[553:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[553:56] But, you know, that was
[553:58] Yeah.
[553:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[554:03] Right?
[554:04] Yeah.
[554:05] We were much later.
[554:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[554:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[554:13] Yeah.
[554:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[554:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[554:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[554:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[554:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[554:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[554:36] September, October, something like that,
[554:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[554:46] More Jim than me.
[554:48] But so yeah,
[554:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[554:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[554:57] Yep.
[555:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[555:03] Right?
[555:04] I think probably
[555:06] they could have
[555:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[555:14] doing any hedging.
[555:17] And then later,
[555:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[555:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[555:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[555:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[555:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[555:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[555:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[556:03] get people to fight over it,
[556:06] but
[556:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[556:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[556:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[556:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[556:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[556:28] that was the whole world.
[556:30] Right?
[556:31] You know, that was everything,
[556:34] right, was several months
[556:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[556:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[556:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[556:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[556:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[556:55] sorry, 2013.
[557:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[557:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[557:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[557:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[557:20] going on.
[557:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[557:27] so just three further days.
[557:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[557:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[557:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[557:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[557:52] So,
[557:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[558:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[558:03] Oh,
[558:04] sorry.
[558:05] You
[558:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[558:11] Right?
[558:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[558:17] you had,
[558:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[558:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[558:26] Yeah.
[558:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[558:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[558:38] But
[558:39] then, yeah,
[558:40] following that,
[558:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[558:45] onto those teams.
[558:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[558:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[558:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[559:02] And then you
[559:04] and then you guys starting
[559:06] whenever you were starting.
[559:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[559:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[559:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[559:23] and you basically did have a major,
[559:27] you know,
[559:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[559:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[559:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[559:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[559:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[559:48] And then it's like, right.
[559:51] Sorry.
[559:52] You're out,
[559:54] and you're not getting any money.
[559:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[560:00] Yes.
[560:01] Do you
[560:02] so my memory
[560:04] around the C++ client was that
[560:06] there were funds to
[560:08] do a security audit
[560:10] for
[560:11] two clients,
[560:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[560:17] Right?
[560:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[560:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[560:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[560:33] I'm not they sure did.
[560:37] You know?
[560:38] You know mean?
[560:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[560:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[560:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[560:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[560:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[561:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[561:11] mid 2015,
[561:12] it's like,
[561:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[561:19] And then
[561:20] that's what happened.
[561:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[561:24] I mean,
[561:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[561:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[561:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[561:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[561:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[561:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[561:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[561:56] as a client,
[561:57] like, died,
[562:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[562:06] It's like, right.
[562:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[562:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[562:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[562:26] across solc,
[562:28] the tests,
[562:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[562:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[562:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[562:48] but
[562:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[562:53] Right?
[562:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[562:58] He was he was building that client.
[563:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[563:05] He was,
[563:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[563:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[563:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[563:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[563:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[563:27] Right?
[563:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[563:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[563:34] closer with Mist,
[563:37] you know, with on Mist.
[563:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[563:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[563:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[563:51] But but, yeah,
[563:53] that would make sense.
[563:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[563:59] And and
[564:00] wait.
[564:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[564:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[564:08] Yeah.
[564:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[564:13] But yeah.
[564:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[564:17] Okay.
[564:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[564:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[564:22] Yes.
[564:23] So, yeah,
[564:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[564:30] you know, for for f.
[564:32] It was called f.
[564:34] It was just called f the executable.
[564:38] So you'd have f and again,
[564:40] yeah, you had f.
[564:42] You had solc.
[564:44] You had
[564:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[564:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[564:50] Acute client.
[564:52] You had,
[564:53] which was the gooey miner.
[564:56] Yeah.
[564:57] That's right.
[564:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[565:05] And then you had one,
[565:07] which was sort of
[565:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[565:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[565:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[565:19] You're running a node,
[565:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[565:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[565:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[565:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[565:41] That's a lot.
[565:43] That that was a lot.
[565:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[565:52] Right?
[565:54] Right.
[565:55] Right.
[565:56] Right.
[565:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[566:00] I mean, when I started,
[566:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[566:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[566:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[566:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[566:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[566:20] Yeah.
[566:22] Dev p two p.
[566:23] Live p two p.
[566:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[566:29] documentation all over the place.
[566:31] I mean You know?
[566:33] I think, you know,
[566:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[566:45] it's like, right.
[566:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[566:51] Right?
[566:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[566:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[567:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[567:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[567:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[567:19] There was no
[567:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[567:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[567:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[567:32] So it's like, right.
[567:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[567:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[567:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[567:50] So yeah,
[567:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[567:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[568:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[568:07] and specifically
[568:09] decoupling
[568:10] and the tests from the client.
[568:14] Right?
[568:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[568:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[568:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[568:32] compiling QT,
[568:35] all of this stuff.
[568:37] So just to get you know?
[568:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[568:44] for Solsea either.
[568:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[568:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[568:55] You have to do all of that.
[568:57] So I remember,
[569:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[569:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[569:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[569:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[569:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[569:20] This is not great.
[569:22] It was my benefit.
[569:25] It's amazing.
[569:27] But, yeah,
[569:28] it was,
[569:30] yeah,
[569:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[569:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[569:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[569:41] coming back,
[569:42] looking at it,
[569:44] saying, like, this can't be
[569:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[569:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[570:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[570:07] you know, but you're right.
[570:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[570:14] You know, talking about that,
[570:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[570:21] and everything.
[570:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[570:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[570:32] because that seems,
[570:34] you know, in an organized way.
[570:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[570:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[570:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[570:45] You know, things as simple as,
[570:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[570:50] like, technical
[570:51] leads that actually lead?
[570:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[570:58] Have we got any IT ?
[571:00] Have we got
[571:02] anything?
[571:03] And it's like, no.
[571:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[571:09] And
[571:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[571:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[571:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[571:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[571:29] Right?
[571:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[571:35] Yeah.
[571:36] You know,
[571:38] I I
[571:39] alright.
[571:42] Okay.
[571:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[571:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[571:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[571:55] but it was kind of similar.
[571:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[572:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[572:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[572:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[572:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[572:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[572:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[572:37] And but it's, I think,
[572:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[572:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[572:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[572:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[573:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[573:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[573:09] Yeah.
[573:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[573:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[573:18] I was finding these the other day.
[573:21] I was finding the first commits
[573:24] for PyEthereum,
[573:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[573:33] and Go Ethereum.
[573:36] And they were all
[573:37] I think they were all November or December.
[573:41] I think they were all 2013,
[573:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[573:47] Yeah.
[573:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[573:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[573:56] But, you know, that was
[573:58] Yeah.
[573:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[574:03] Right?
[574:04] Yeah.
[574:05] We were much later.
[574:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[574:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[574:13] Yeah.
[574:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[574:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[574:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[574:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[574:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[574:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[574:36] September, October, something like that,
[574:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[574:46] More Jim than me.
[574:48] But so yeah,
[574:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[574:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[574:57] Yep.
[575:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[575:03] Right?
[575:04] I think probably
[575:06] they could have
[575:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[575:14] doing any hedging.
[575:17] And then later,
[575:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[575:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[575:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[575:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[575:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[575:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[575:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[576:03] get people to fight over it,
[576:06] but
[576:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[576:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[576:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[576:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[576:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[576:28] that was the whole world.
[576:30] Right?
[576:31] You know, that was everything,
[576:34] right, was several months
[576:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[576:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[576:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[576:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[576:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[576:55] sorry, 2013.
[577:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[577:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[577:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[577:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[577:20] going on.
[577:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[577:27] so just three further days.
[577:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[577:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[577:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[577:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[577:52] So,
[577:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[578:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[578:03] Oh,
[578:04] sorry.
[578:05] You
[578:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[578:11] Right?
[578:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[578:17] you had,
[578:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[578:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[578:26] Yeah.
[578:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[578:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[578:38] But
[578:39] then, yeah,
[578:40] following that,
[578:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[578:45] onto those teams.
[578:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[578:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[578:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[579:02] And then you
[579:04] and then you guys starting
[579:06] whenever you were starting.
[579:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[579:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[579:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[579:23] and you basically did have a major,
[579:27] you know,
[579:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[579:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[579:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[579:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[579:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[579:48] And then it's like, right.
[579:51] Sorry.
[579:52] You're out,
[579:54] and you're not getting any money.
[579:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[580:00] Yes.
[580:01] Do you
[580:02] so my memory
[580:04] around the C++ client was that
[580:06] there were funds to
[580:08] do a security audit
[580:10] for
[580:11] two clients,
[580:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[580:17] Right?
[580:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[580:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[580:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[580:33] I'm not they sure did.
[580:37] You know?
[580:38] You know mean?
[580:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[580:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[580:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[580:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[580:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[581:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[581:11] mid 2015,
[581:12] it's like,
[581:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[581:19] And then
[581:20] that's what happened.
[581:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[581:24] I mean,
[581:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[581:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[581:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[581:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[581:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[581:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[581:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[581:56] as a client,
[581:57] like, died,
[582:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[582:06] It's like, right.
[582:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[582:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[582:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[582:26] across solc,
[582:28] the tests,
[582:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[582:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[582:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[582:48] but
[582:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[582:53] Right?
[582:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[582:58] He was he was building that client.
[583:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[583:05] He was,
[583:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[583:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[583:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[583:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[583:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[583:27] Right?
[583:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[583:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[583:34] closer with Mist,
[583:37] you know, with on Mist.
[583:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[583:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[583:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[583:51] But but, yeah,
[583:53] that would make sense.
[583:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[583:59] And and
[584:00] wait.
[584:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[584:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[584:08] Yeah.
[584:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[584:13] But yeah.
[584:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[584:17] Okay.
[584:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[584:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[584:22] Yes.
[584:23] So, yeah,
[584:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[584:30] you know, for for f.
[584:32] It was called f.
[584:34] It was just called f the executable.
[584:38] So you'd have f and again,
[584:40] yeah, you had f.
[584:42] You had solc.
[584:44] You had
[584:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[584:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[584:50] Acute client.
[584:52] You had,
[584:53] which was the gooey miner.
[584:56] Yeah.
[584:57] That's right.
[584:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[585:05] And then you had one,
[585:07] which was sort of
[585:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[585:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[585:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[585:19] You're running a node,
[585:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[585:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[585:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[585:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[585:41] That's a lot.
[585:43] That that was a lot.
[585:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[585:52] Right?
[585:54] Right.
[585:55] Right.
[585:56] Right.
[585:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[586:00] I mean, when I started,
[586:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[586:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[586:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[586:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[586:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[586:20] Yeah.
[586:22] Dev p two p.
[586:23] Live p two p.
[586:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[586:29] documentation all over the place.
[586:31] I mean You know?
[586:33] I think, you know,
[586:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[586:45] it's like, right.
[586:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[586:51] Right?
[586:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[586:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[587:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[587:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[587:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[587:19] There was no
[587:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[587:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[587:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[587:32] So it's like, right.
[587:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[587:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[587:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[587:50] So yeah,
[587:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[587:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[588:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[588:07] and specifically
[588:09] decoupling
[588:10] and the tests from the client.
[588:14] Right?
[588:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[588:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[588:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[588:32] compiling QT,
[588:35] all of this stuff.
[588:37] So just to get you know?
[588:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[588:44] for Solsea either.
[588:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[588:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[588:55] You have to do all of that.
[588:57] So I remember,
[589:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[589:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[589:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[589:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[589:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[589:20] This is not great.
[589:22] It was my benefit.
[589:25] It's amazing.
[589:27] But, yeah,
[589:28] it was,
[589:30] yeah,
[589:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[589:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[589:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[589:41] coming back,
[589:42] looking at it,
[589:44] saying, like, this can't be
[589:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[589:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[590:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[590:07] you know, but you're right.
[590:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[590:14] You know, talking about that,
[590:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[590:21] and everything.
[590:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[590:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[590:32] because that seems,
[590:34] you know, in an organized way.
[590:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[590:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[590:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[590:45] You know, things as simple as,
[590:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[590:50] like, technical
[590:51] leads that actually lead?
[590:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[590:58] Have we got any IT ?
[591:00] Have we got
[591:02] anything?
[591:03] And it's like, no.
[591:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[591:09] And
[591:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[591:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[591:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[591:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[591:29] Right?
[591:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[591:35] Yeah.
[591:36] You know,
[591:38] I I
[591:39] alright.
[591:42] Okay.
[591:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[591:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[591:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[591:55] but it was kind of similar.

[595:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[595:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[596:03] get people to fight over it,
[596:06] but
[596:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[596:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[596:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[596:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[596:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[596:28] that was the whole world.
[596:30] Right?
[596:31] You know, that was everything,
[596:34] right, was several months
[596:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[596:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[596:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[596:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[596:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[596:55] sorry, 2013.
[597:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[597:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[597:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[597:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[597:20] going on.
[597:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[597:27] so just three further days.
[597:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[597:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[597:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[597:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[597:52] So,
[597:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[598:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[598:03] Oh,
[598:04] sorry.
[598:05] You
[598:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[598:11] Right?
[598:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[598:17] you had,
[598:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[598:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[598:26] Yeah.
[598:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[598:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[598:38] But
[598:39] then, yeah,
[598:40] following that,
[598:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[598:45] onto those teams.
[598:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[598:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[598:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[599:02] And then you
[599:04] and then you guys starting
[599:06] whenever you were starting.
[599:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[599:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[599:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[599:23] and you basically did have a major,
[599:27] you know,
[599:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[599:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[599:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[599:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[599:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[599:48] And then it's like, right.
[599:51] Sorry.
[599:52] You're out,
[599:54] and you're not getting any money.
[599:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[600:00] Yes.
[600:01] Do you
[600:02] so my memory
[600:04] around the C++ client was that
[600:06] there were funds to
[600:08] do a security audit
[600:10] for
[600:11] two clients,
[600:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[600:17] Right?
[600:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[600:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[600:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[600:33] I'm not they sure did.
[600:37] You know?
[600:38] You know mean?
[600:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[600:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[600:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[600:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[600:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[601:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[601:11] mid 2015,
[601:12] it's like,
[601:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[601:19] And then
[601:20] that's what happened.
[601:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[601:24] I mean,
[601:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[601:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[601:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[601:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[601:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[601:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[601:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[601:56] as a client,
[601:57] like, died,
[602:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[602:06] It's like, right.
[602:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[602:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[602:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[602:26] across solc,
[602:28] the tests,
[602:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[602:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[602:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[602:48] but
[602:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[602:53] Right?
[602:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[602:58] He was he was building that client.
[603:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[603:05] He was,
[603:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[603:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[603:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[603:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[603:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[603:27] Right?
[603:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[603:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[603:34] closer with Mist,
[603:37] you know, with on Mist.
[603:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[603:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[603:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[603:51] But but, yeah,
[603:53] that would make sense.
[603:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[603:59] And and
[604:00] wait.
[604:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[604:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[604:08] Yeah.
[604:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[604:13] But yeah.
[604:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[604:17] Okay.
[604:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[604:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[604:22] Yes.
[604:23] So, yeah,
[604:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[604:30] you know, for for f.
[604:32] It was called f.
[604:34] It was just called f the executable.
[604:38] So you'd have f and again,
[604:40] yeah, you had f.
[604:42] You had solc.
[604:44] You had
[604:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[604:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[604:50] Acute client.
[604:52] You had,
[604:53] which was the gooey miner.
[604:56] Yeah.
[604:57] That's right.
[604:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[605:05] And then you had one,
[605:07] which was sort of
[605:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[605:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[605:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[605:19] You're running a node,
[605:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[605:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[605:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[605:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[605:41] That's a lot.
[605:43] That that was a lot.
[605:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[605:52] Right?
[605:54] Right.
[605:55] Right.
[605:56] Right.
[605:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[606:00] I mean, when I started,
[606:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[606:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[606:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[606:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[606:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[606:20] Yeah.
[606:22] Dev p two p.
[606:23] Live p two p.
[606:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[606:29] documentation all over the place.
[606:31] I mean You know?
[606:33] I think, you know,
[606:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[606:45] it's like, right.
[606:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[606:51] Right?
[606:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[606:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[607:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[607:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[607:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[607:19] There was no
[607:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[607:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[607:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[607:32] So it's like, right.
[607:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[607:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[607:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[607:50] So yeah,
[607:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[607:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[608:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[608:07] and specifically
[608:09] decoupling
[608:10] and the tests from the client.
[608:14] Right?
[608:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[608:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[608:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[608:32] compiling QT,
[608:35] all of this stuff.
[608:37] So just to get you know?
[608:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[608:44] for Solsea either.
[608:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[608:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[608:55] You have to do all of that.
[608:57] So I remember,
[609:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[609:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[609:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[609:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[609:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[609:20] This is not great.
[609:22] It was my benefit.
[609:25] It's amazing.
[609:27] But, yeah,
[609:28] it was,
[609:30] yeah,
[609:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[609:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[609:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[609:41] coming back,
[609:42] looking at it,
[609:44] saying, like, this can't be
[609:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[609:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[610:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[610:07] you know, but you're right.
[610:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[610:14] You know, talking about that,
[610:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[610:21] and everything.
[610:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[610:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[610:32] because that seems,
[610:34] you know, in an organized way.
[610:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[610:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[610:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[610:45] You know, things as simple as,
[610:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[610:50] like, technical
[610:51] leads that actually lead?
[610:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[610:58] Have we got any IT ?
[611:00] Have we got
[611:02] anything?
[611:03] And it's like, no.
[611:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[611:09] And
[611:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[611:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[611:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[611:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[611:29] Right?
[611:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[611:35] Yeah.
[611:36] You know,
[611:38] I I
[611:39] alright.
[611:42] Okay.
[611:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[611:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[611:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[611:55] but it was kind of similar.
[611:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[612:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[612:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[612:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[612:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[612:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[612:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[612:37] And but it's, I think,
[612:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[612:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[612:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[612:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[613:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[613:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[613:09] Yeah.
[613:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[613:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[613:18] I was finding these the other day.
[613:21] I was finding the first commits
[613:24] for PyEthereum,
[613:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[613:33] and Go Ethereum.
[613:36] And they were all
[613:37] I think they were all November or December.
[613:41] I think they were all 2013,
[613:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[613:47] Yeah.
[613:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[613:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[613:56] But, you know, that was
[613:58] Yeah.
[613:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[614:03] Right?
[614:04] Yeah.
[614:05] We were much later.
[614:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[614:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[614:13] Yeah.
[614:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[614:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[614:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[614:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[614:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[614:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[614:36] September, October, something like that,
[614:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[614:46] More Jim than me.
[614:48] But so yeah,
[614:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[614:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[614:57] Yep.
[615:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[615:03] Right?
[615:04] I think probably
[615:06] they could have
[615:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[615:14] doing any hedging.
[615:17] And then later,
[615:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[615:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[615:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[615:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[615:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[615:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[615:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[616:03] get people to fight over it,
[616:06] but
[616:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[616:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[616:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[616:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[616:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[616:28] that was the whole world.
[616:30] Right?
[616:31] You know, that was everything,
[616:34] right, was several months
[616:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[616:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[616:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[616:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[616:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[616:55] sorry, 2013.
[617:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[617:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[617:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[617:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[617:20] going on.
[617:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[617:27] so just three further days.
[617:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[617:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[617:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[617:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[617:52] So,
[617:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[618:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[618:03] Oh,
[618:04] sorry.
[618:05] You
[618:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[618:11] Right?
[618:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[618:17] you had,
[618:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[618:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[618:26] Yeah.
[618:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[618:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[618:38] But
[618:39] then, yeah,
[618:40] following that,
[618:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[618:45] onto those teams.
[618:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[618:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[618:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[619:02] And then you
[619:04] and then you guys starting
[619:06] whenever you were starting.
[619:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[619:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[619:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[619:23] and you basically did have a major,
[619:27] you know,
[619:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[619:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[619:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[619:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[619:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[619:48] And then it's like, right.
[619:51] Sorry.
[619:52] You're out,
[619:54] and you're not getting any money.
[619:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[620:00] Yes.
[620:01] Do you
[620:02] so my memory
[620:04] around the C++ client was that
[620:06] there were funds to
[620:08] do a security audit
[620:10] for
[620:11] two clients,
[620:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[620:17] Right?
[620:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[620:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[620:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[620:33] I'm not they sure did.
[620:37] You know?
[620:38] You know mean?
[620:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[620:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[620:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[620:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[620:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[621:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[621:11] mid 2015,
[621:12] it's like,
[621:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[621:19] And then
[621:20] that's what happened.
[621:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[621:24] I mean,
[621:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[621:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[621:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[621:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[621:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[621:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[621:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[621:56] as a client,
[621:57] like, died,
[622:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[622:06] It's like, right.
[622:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[622:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[622:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[622:26] across solc,
[622:28] the tests,
[622:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[622:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[622:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[622:48] but
[622:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[622:53] Right?
[622:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[622:58] He was he was building that client.
[623:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[623:05] He was,
[623:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[623:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[623:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[623:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[623:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[623:27] Right?
[623:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[623:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[623:34] closer with Mist,
[623:37] you know, with on Mist.
[623:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[623:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[623:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[623:51] But but, yeah,
[623:53] that would make sense.
[623:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[623:59] And and
[624:00] wait.
[624:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[624:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[624:08] Yeah.
[624:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[624:13] But yeah.
[624:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[624:17] Okay.
[624:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[624:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[624:22] Yes.
[624:23] So, yeah,
[624:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[624:30] you know, for for f.
[624:32] It was called f.
[624:34] It was just called f the executable.
[624:38] So you'd have f and again,
[624:40] yeah, you had f.
[624:42] You had solc.
[624:44] You had
[624:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[624:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[624:50] Acute client.
[624:52] You had,
[624:53] which was the gooey miner.
[624:56] Yeah.
[624:57] That's right.
[624:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[625:05] And then you had one,
[625:07] which was sort of
[625:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[625:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[625:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[625:19] You're running a node,
[625:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[625:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[625:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[625:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[625:41] That's a lot.
[625:43] That that was a lot.
[625:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[625:52] Right?
[625:54] Right.
[625:55] Right.
[625:56] Right.
[625:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[626:00] I mean, when I started,
[626:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[626:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[626:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[626:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[626:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[626:20] Yeah.
[626:22] Dev p two p.
[626:23] Live p two p.
[626:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[626:29] documentation all over the place.
[626:31] I mean You know?
[626:33] I think, you know,
[626:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[626:45] it's like, right.
[626:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[626:51] Right?
[626:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[626:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[627:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[627:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[627:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[627:19] There was no
[627:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[627:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[627:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[627:32] So it's like, right.
[627:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[627:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[627:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[627:50] So yeah,
[627:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[627:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[628:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[628:07] and specifically
[628:09] decoupling
[628:10] and the tests from the client.
[628:14] Right?
[628:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[628:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[628:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[628:32] compiling QT,
[628:35] all of this stuff.
[628:37] So just to get you know?
[628:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[628:44] for Solsea either.
[628:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[628:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[628:55] You have to do all of that.
[628:57] So I remember,
[629:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[629:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[629:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[629:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[629:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[629:20] This is not great.
[629:22] It was my benefit.
[629:25] It's amazing.
[629:27] But, yeah,
[629:28] it was,
[629:30] yeah,
[629:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[629:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[629:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[629:41] coming back,
[629:42] looking at it,
[629:44] saying, like, this can't be
[629:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[629:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[630:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[630:07] you know, but you're right.
[630:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[630:14] You know, talking about that,
[630:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[630:21] and everything.
[630:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[630:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[630:32] because that seems,
[630:34] you know, in an organized way.
[630:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[630:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[630:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[630:45] You know, things as simple as,
[630:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[630:50] like, technical
[630:51] leads that actually lead?
[630:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[630:58] Have we got any IT ?
[631:00] Have we got
[631:02] anything?
[631:03] And it's like, no.
[631:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[631:09] And
[631:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[631:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[631:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[631:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[631:29] Right?
[631:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[631:35] Yeah.
[631:36] You know,
[631:38] I I
[631:39] alright.
[631:42] Okay.
[631:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[631:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[631:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[631:55] but it was kind of similar.
[631:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[632:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[632:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[632:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[632:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[632:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[632:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[632:37] And but it's, I think,
[632:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[632:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[632:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[632:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[633:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[633:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[633:09] Yeah.
[633:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[633:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[633:18] I was finding these the other day.
[633:21] I was finding the first commits
[633:24] for PyEthereum,
[633:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[633:33] and Go Ethereum.
[633:36] And they were all
[633:37] I think they were all November or December.
[633:41] I think they were all 2013,
[633:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[633:47] Yeah.
[633:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[633:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[633:56] But, you know, that was
[633:58] Yeah.
[633:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[634:03] Right?
[634:04] Yeah.
[634:05] We were much later.
[634:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[634:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[634:13] Yeah.
[634:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[634:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[634:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[634:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[634:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[634:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[634:36] September, October, something like that,
[634:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[634:46] More Jim than me.
[634:48] But so yeah,
[634:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[634:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[634:57] Yep.
[635:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[635:03] Right?
[635:04] I think probably
[635:06] they could have
[635:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[635:14] doing any hedging.
[635:17] And then later,
[635:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[635:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[635:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[635:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[635:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[635:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[635:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[636:03] get people to fight over it,
[636:06] but
[636:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[636:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[636:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[636:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[636:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[636:28] that was the whole world.
[636:30] Right?
[636:31] You know, that was everything,
[636:34] right, was several months
[636:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[636:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[636:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[636:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[636:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[636:55] sorry, 2013.
[637:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[637:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[637:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[637:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[637:20] going on.
[637:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[637:27] so just three further days.
[637:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[637:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[637:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[637:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[637:52] So,
[637:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[638:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[638:03] Oh,
[638:04] sorry.
[638:05] You
[638:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[638:11] Right?
[638:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[638:17] you had,
[638:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[638:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[638:26] Yeah.
[638:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[638:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[638:38] But
[638:39] then, yeah,
[638:40] following that,
[638:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[638:45] onto those teams.
[638:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[638:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[638:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[639:02] And then you
[639:04] and then you guys starting
[639:06] whenever you were starting.
[639:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[639:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[639:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[639:23] and you basically did have a major,
[639:27] you know,
[639:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[639:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[639:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[639:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[639:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[639:48] And then it's like, right.
[639:51] Sorry.
[639:52] You're out,
[639:54] and you're not getting any money.
[639:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[640:00] Yes.
[640:01] Do you
[640:02] so my memory
[640:04] around the C++ client was that
[640:06] there were funds to
[640:08] do a security audit
[640:10] for
[640:11] two clients,
[640:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[640:17] Right?
[640:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[640:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[640:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[640:33] I'm not they sure did.
[640:37] You know?
[640:38] You know mean?
[640:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[640:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[640:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[640:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[640:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[641:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[641:11] mid 2015,
[641:12] it's like,
[641:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[641:19] And then
[641:20] that's what happened.
[641:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[641:24] I mean,
[641:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[641:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[641:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[641:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[641:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[641:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[641:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[641:56] as a client,
[641:57] like, died,
[642:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[642:06] It's like, right.
[642:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[642:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[642:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[642:26] across solc,
[642:28] the tests,
[642:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[642:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[642:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[642:48] but
[642:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[642:53] Right?
[642:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[642:58] He was he was building that client.
[643:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[643:05] He was,
[643:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[643:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[643:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[643:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[643:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[643:27] Right?
[643:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[643:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[643:34] closer with Mist,
[643:37] you know, with on Mist.
[643:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[643:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[643:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[643:51] But but, yeah,
[643:53] that would make sense.
[643:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[643:59] And and
[644:00] wait.
[644:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[644:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[644:08] Yeah.
[644:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[644:13] But yeah.
[644:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[644:17] Okay.
[644:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[644:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[644:22] Yes.
[644:23] So, yeah,
[644:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[644:30] you know, for for f.
[644:32] It was called f.
[644:34] It was just called f the executable.
[644:38] So you'd have f and again,
[644:40] yeah, you had f.
[644:42] You had solc.
[644:44] You had
[644:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[644:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[644:50] Acute client.
[644:52] You had,
[644:53] which was the gooey miner.
[644:56] Yeah.
[644:57] That's right.
[644:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[645:05] And then you had one,
[645:07] which was sort of
[645:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[645:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[645:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[645:19] You're running a node,
[645:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[645:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[645:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[645:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[645:41] That's a lot.
[645:43] That that was a lot.
[645:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[645:52] Right?
[645:54] Right.
[645:55] Right.
[645:56] Right.
[645:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[646:00] I mean, when I started,
[646:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[646:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[646:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[646:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[646:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[646:20] Yeah.
[646:22] Dev p two p.
[646:23] Live p two p.
[646:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[646:29] documentation all over the place.
[646:31] I mean You know?
[646:33] I think, you know,
[646:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[646:45] it's like, right.
[646:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[646:51] Right?
[646:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[646:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[647:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[647:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[647:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[647:19] There was no
[647:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[647:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[647:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[647:32] So it's like, right.
[647:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[647:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[647:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[647:50] So yeah,
[647:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[647:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[648:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[648:07] and specifically
[648:09] decoupling
[648:10] and the tests from the client.
[648:14] Right?
[648:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[648:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[648:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[648:32] compiling QT,
[648:35] all of this stuff.
[648:37] So just to get you know?
[648:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[648:44] for Solsea either.
[648:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[648:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[648:55] You have to do all of that.
[648:57] So I remember,
[649:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[649:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[649:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[649:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[649:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[649:20] This is not great.
[649:22] It was my benefit.
[649:25] It's amazing.
[649:27] But, yeah,
[649:28] it was,
[649:30] yeah,
[649:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[649:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[649:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[649:41] coming back,
[649:42] looking at it,
[649:44] saying, like, this can't be
[649:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[649:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[650:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[650:07] you know, but you're right.
[650:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[650:14] You know, talking about that,
[650:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[650:21] and everything.
[650:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[650:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[650:32] because that seems,
[650:34] you know, in an organized way.
[650:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[650:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[650:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[650:45] You know, things as simple as,
[650:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[650:50] like, technical
[650:51] leads that actually lead?
[650:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[650:58] Have we got any IT ?
[651:00] Have we got
[651:02] anything?
[651:03] And it's like, no.
[651:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[651:09] And
[651:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[651:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[651:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[651:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[651:29] Right?
[651:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[651:35] Yeah.
[651:36] You know,
[651:38] I I
[651:39] alright.
[651:42] Okay.
[651:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[651:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[651:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[651:55] but it was kind of similar.
[651:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[652:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[652:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[652:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[652:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[652:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[652:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[652:37] And but it's, I think,
[652:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[652:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[652:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[652:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[653:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[653:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[653:09] Yeah.
[653:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[653:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[653:18] I was finding these the other day.
[653:21] I was finding the first commits
[653:24] for PyEthereum,
[653:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[653:33] and Go Ethereum.
[653:36] And they were all
[653:37] I think they were all November or December.
[653:41] I think they were all 2013,
[653:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[653:47] Yeah.
[653:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[653:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[653:56] But, you know, that was
[653:58] Yeah.
[653:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[654:03] Right?
[654:04] Yeah.
[654:05] We were much later.
[654:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[654:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[654:13] Yeah.
[654:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[654:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[654:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[654:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[654:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[654:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[654:36] September, October, something like that,
[654:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[654:46] More Jim than me.
[654:48] But so yeah,
[654:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[654:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[654:57] Yep.
[655:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[655:03] Right?
[655:04] I think probably
[655:06] they could have
[655:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[655:14] doing any hedging.
[655:17] And then later,
[655:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[655:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[655:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[655:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[655:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[655:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[655:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[656:03] get people to fight over it,
[656:06] but
[656:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[656:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[656:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[656:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[656:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[656:28] that was the whole world.
[656:30] Right?
[656:31] You know, that was everything,
[656:34] right, was several months
[656:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[656:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[656:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[656:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[656:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[656:55] sorry, 2013.
[657:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[657:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[657:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[657:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[657:20] going on.
[657:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[657:27] so just three further days.
[657:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[657:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[657:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[657:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[657:52] So,
[657:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[658:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[658:03] Oh,
[658:04] sorry.
[658:05] You
[658:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[658:11] Right?
[658:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[658:17] you had,
[658:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[658:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[658:26] Yeah.
[658:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[658:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[658:38] But
[658:39] then, yeah,
[658:40] following that,
[658:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[658:45] onto those teams.
[658:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[658:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[658:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[659:02] And then you
[659:04] and then you guys starting
[659:06] whenever you were starting.
[659:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[659:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[659:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[659:23] and you basically did have a major,
[659:27] you know,
[659:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[659:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[659:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[659:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[659:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[659:48] And then it's like, right.
[659:51] Sorry.
[659:52] You're out,
[659:54] and you're not getting any money.
[659:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[660:00] Yes.
[660:01] Do you
[660:02] so my memory
[660:04] around the C++ client was that
[660:06] there were funds to
[660:08] do a security audit
[660:10] for
[660:11] two clients,
[660:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[660:17] Right?
[660:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[660:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[660:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[660:33] I'm not they sure did.
[660:37] You know?
[660:38] You know mean?
[660:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[660:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[660:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[660:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[660:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[661:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[661:11] mid 2015,
[661:12] it's like,
[661:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[661:19] And then
[661:20] that's what happened.
[661:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[661:24] I mean,
[661:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[661:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[661:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[661:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[661:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[661:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[661:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[661:56] as a client,
[661:57] like, died,
[662:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[662:06] It's like, right.
[662:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[662:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[662:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[662:26] across solc,
[662:28] the tests,
[662:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[662:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[662:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[662:48] but
[662:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[662:53] Right?
[662:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[662:58] He was he was building that client.
[663:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[663:05] He was,
[663:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[663:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[663:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[663:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[663:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[663:27] Right?
[663:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[663:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[663:34] closer with Mist,
[663:37] you know, with on Mist.
[663:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[663:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[663:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[663:51] But but, yeah,
[663:53] that would make sense.
[663:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[663:59] And and
[664:00] wait.
[664:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[664:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[664:08] Yeah.
[664:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[664:13] But yeah.
[664:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[664:17] Okay.
[664:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[664:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[664:22] Yes.
[664:23] So, yeah,
[664:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[664:30] you know, for for f.
[664:32] It was called f.
[664:34] It was just called f the executable.
[664:38] So you'd have f and again,
[664:40] yeah, you had f.
[664:42] You had solc.
[664:44] You had
[664:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[664:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[664:50] Acute client.
[664:52] You had,
[664:53] which was the gooey miner.
[664:56] Yeah.
[664:57] That's right.
[664:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[665:05] And then you had one,
[665:07] which was sort of
[665:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[665:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[665:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[665:19] You're running a node,
[665:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[665:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[665:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[665:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[665:41] That's a lot.
[665:43] That that was a lot.
[665:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[665:52] Right?
[665:54] Right.
[665:55] Right.
[665:56] Right.
[665:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[666:00] I mean, when I started,
[666:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[666:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[666:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[666:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[666:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[666:20] Yeah.
[666:22] Dev p two p.
[666:23] Live p two p.
[666:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[666:29] documentation all over the place.
[666:31] I mean You know?
[666:33] I think, you know,
[666:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[666:45] it's like, right.
[666:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[666:51] Right?
[666:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[666:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[667:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[667:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[667:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[667:19] There was no
[667:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[667:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[667:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[667:32] So it's like, right.
[667:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[667:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[667:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[667:50] So yeah,
[667:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[667:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[668:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[668:07] and specifically
[668:09] decoupling
[668:10] and the tests from the client.
[668:14] Right?
[668:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[668:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[668:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[668:32] compiling QT,
[668:35] all of this stuff.
[668:37] So just to get you know?
[668:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[668:44] for Solsea either.
[668:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[668:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[668:55] You have to do all of that.
[668:57] So I remember,
[669:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[669:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[669:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[669:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[669:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[669:20] This is not great.
[669:22] It was my benefit.
[669:25] It's amazing.
[669:27] But, yeah,
[669:28] it was,
[669:30] yeah,
[669:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[669:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[669:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[669:41] coming back,
[669:42] looking at it,
[669:44] saying, like, this can't be
[669:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[669:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[670:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[670:07] you know, but you're right.
[670:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[670:14] You know, talking about that,
[670:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[670:21] and everything.
[670:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[670:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[670:32] because that seems,
[670:34] you know, in an organized way.
[670:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[670:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[670:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[670:45] You know, things as simple as,
[670:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[670:50] like, technical
[670:51] leads that actually lead?
[670:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[670:58] Have we got any IT ?
[671:00] Have we got
[671:02] anything?
[671:03] And it's like, no.
[671:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[671:09] And
[671:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[671:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[671:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[671:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[671:29] Right?
[671:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[671:35] Yeah.
[671:36] You know,
[671:38] I I
[671:39] alright.
[671:42] Okay.
[671:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[671:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[671:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[671:55] but it was kind of similar.
[671:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[672:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[672:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[672:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[672:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[672:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[672:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[672:37] And but it's, I think,
[672:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[672:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[672:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[672:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[673:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[673:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[673:09] Yeah.
[673:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[673:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[673:18] I was finding these the other day.
[673:21] I was finding the first commits
[673:24] for PyEthereum,
[673:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[673:33] and Go Ethereum.
[673:36] And they were all
[673:37] I think they were all November or December.
[673:41] I think they were all 2013,
[673:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[673:47] Yeah.
[673:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[673:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[673:56] But, you know, that was
[673:58] Yeah.
[673:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[674:03] Right?
[674:04] Yeah.
[674:05] We were much later.
[674:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[674:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[674:13] Yeah.
[674:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[674:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[674:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[674:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[674:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[674:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[674:36] September, October, something like that,
[674:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[674:46] More Jim than me.
[674:48] But so yeah,
[674:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[674:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[674:57] Yep.
[675:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[675:03] Right?
[675:04] I think probably
[675:06] they could have
[675:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[675:14] doing any hedging.
[675:17] And then later,
[675:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[675:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[675:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[675:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[675:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[675:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[675:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[676:03] get people to fight over it,
[676:06] but
[676:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[676:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[676:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[676:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[676:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[676:28] that was the whole world.
[676:30] Right?
[676:31] You know, that was everything,
[676:34] right, was several months
[676:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[676:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[676:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[676:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[676:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[676:55] sorry, 2013.
[677:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[677:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[677:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[677:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[677:20] going on.
[677:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[677:27] so just three further days.
[677:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[677:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[677:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[677:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[677:52] So,
[677:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[678:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[678:03] Oh,
[678:04] sorry.
[678:05] You
[678:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[678:11] Right?
[678:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[678:17] you had,
[678:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[678:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[678:26] Yeah.
[678:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[678:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[678:38] But
[678:39] then, yeah,
[678:40] following that,
[678:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[678:45] onto those teams.
[678:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[678:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[678:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[679:02] And then you
[679:04] and then you guys starting
[679:06] whenever you were starting.
[679:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[679:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[679:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[679:23] and you basically did have a major,
[679:27] you know,
[679:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[679:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[679:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[679:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[679:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[679:48] And then it's like, right.
[679:51] Sorry.
[679:52] You're out,
[679:54] and you're not getting any money.
[679:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[680:00] Yes.
[680:01] Do you
[680:02] so my memory
[680:04] around the C++ client was that
[680:06] there were funds to
[680:08] do a security audit
[680:10] for
[680:11] two clients,
[680:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[680:17] Right?
[680:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[680:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[680:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[680:33] I'm not they sure did.
[680:37] You know?
[680:38] You know mean?
[680:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[680:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[680:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[680:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[680:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[681:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[681:11] mid 2015,
[681:12] it's like,
[681:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[681:19] And then
[681:20] that's what happened.
[681:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[681:24] I mean,
[681:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[681:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[681:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[681:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[681:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[681:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[681:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[681:56] as a client,
[681:57] like, died,
[682:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[682:06] It's like, right.
[682:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[682:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[682:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[682:26] across solc,
[682:28] the tests,
[682:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[682:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[682:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[682:48] but
[682:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[682:53] Right?
[682:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[682:58] He was he was building that client.
[683:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[683:05] He was,
[683:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[683:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[683:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[683:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[683:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[683:27] Right?
[683:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[683:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[683:34] closer with Mist,
[683:37] you know, with on Mist.
[683:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[683:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[683:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[683:51] But but, yeah,
[683:53] that would make sense.
[683:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[683:59] And and
[684:00] wait.
[684:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[684:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[684:08] Yeah.
[684:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[684:13] But yeah.
[684:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[684:17] Okay.
[684:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[684:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[684:22] Yes.
[684:23] So, yeah,
[684:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[684:30] you know, for for f.
[684:32] It was called f.
[684:34] It was just called f the executable.
[684:38] So you'd have f and again,
[684:40] yeah, you had f.
[684:42] You had solc.
[684:44] You had
[684:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[684:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[684:50] Acute client.
[684:52] You had,
[684:53] which was the gooey miner.
[684:56] Yeah.
[684:57] That's right.
[684:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[685:05] And then you had one,
[685:07] which was sort of
[685:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[685:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[685:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[685:19] You're running a node,
[685:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[685:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[685:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[685:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[685:41] That's a lot.
[685:43] That that was a lot.
[685:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[685:52] Right?
[685:54] Right.
[685:55] Right.
[685:56] Right.
[685:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[686:00] I mean, when I started,
[686:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[686:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[686:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[686:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[686:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[686:20] Yeah.
[686:22] Dev p two p.
[686:23] Live p two p.
[686:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[686:29] documentation all over the place.
[686:31] I mean You know?
[686:33] I think, you know,
[686:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[686:45] it's like, right.
[686:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[686:51] Right?
[686:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[686:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[687:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[687:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[687:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[687:19] There was no
[687:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[687:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[687:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[687:32] So it's like, right.
[687:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[687:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[687:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[687:50] So yeah,
[687:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[687:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[688:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[688:07] and specifically
[688:09] decoupling
[688:10] and the tests from the client.
[688:14] Right?
[688:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[688:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[688:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[688:32] compiling QT,
[688:35] all of this stuff.
[688:37] So just to get you know?
[688:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[688:44] for Solsea either.
[688:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[688:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[688:55] You have to do all of that.
[688:57] So I remember,
[689:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[689:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[689:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[689:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[689:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[689:20] This is not great.
[689:22] It was my benefit.
[689:25] It's amazing.
[689:27] But, yeah,
[689:28] it was,
[689:30] yeah,
[689:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[689:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[689:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[689:41] coming back,
[689:42] looking at it,
[689:44] saying, like, this can't be
[689:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[689:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[690:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[690:07] you know, but you're right.
[690:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[690:14] You know, talking about that,
[690:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[690:21] and everything.
[690:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[690:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[690:32] because that seems,
[690:34] you know, in an organized way.
[690:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[690:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[690:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[690:45] You know, things as simple as,
[690:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[690:50] like, technical
[690:51] leads that actually lead?
[690:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[690:58] Have we got any IT ?
[691:00] Have we got
[691:02] anything?
[691:03] And it's like, no.
[691:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[691:09] And
[691:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[691:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[691:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[691:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[691:29] Right?
[691:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[691:35] Yeah.
[691:36] You know,
[691:38] I I
[691:39] alright.
[691:42] Okay.
[691:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[691:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[691:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[691:55] but it was kind of similar.
[691:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[692:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[692:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[692:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[692:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[692:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[692:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[692:37] And but it's, I think,
[692:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[692:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[692:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[692:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[693:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[693:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[693:09] Yeah.
[693:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[693:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[693:18] I was finding these the other day.
[693:21] I was finding the first commits
[693:24] for PyEthereum,
[693:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[693:33] and Go Ethereum.
[693:36] And they were all
[693:37] I think they were all November or December.
[693:41] I think they were all 2013,
[693:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[693:47] Yeah.
[693:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[693:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[693:56] But, you know, that was
[693:58] Yeah.
[693:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[694:03] Right?
[694:04] Yeah.
[694:05] We were much later.
[694:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[694:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[694:13] Yeah.
[694:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[694:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[694:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[694:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[694:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[694:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[694:36] September, October, something like that,
[694:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[694:46] More Jim than me.
[694:48] But so yeah,
[694:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[694:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[694:57] Yep.
[695:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[695:03] Right?
[695:04] I think probably
[695:06] they could have
[695:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[695:14] doing any hedging.
[695:17] And then later,
[695:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[695:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[695:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[695:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[695:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[695:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[695:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[696:03] get people to fight over it,
[696:06] but
[696:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[696:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[696:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[696:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[696:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[696:28] that was the whole world.
[696:30] Right?
[696:31] You know, that was everything,
[696:34] right, was several months
[696:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[696:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[696:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[696:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[696:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[696:55] sorry, 2013.
[697:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[697:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[697:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[697:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[697:20] going on.
[697:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[697:27] so just three further days.
[697:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[697:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[697:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[697:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[697:52] So,
[697:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[698:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[698:03] Oh,
[698:04] sorry.
[698:05] You
[698:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[698:11] Right?
[698:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[698:17] you had,
[698:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[698:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[698:26] Yeah.
[698:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[698:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[698:38] But
[698:39] then, yeah,
[698:40] following that,
[698:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[698:45] onto those teams.
[698:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[698:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[698:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[699:02] And then you
[699:04] and then you guys starting
[699:06] whenever you were starting.
[699:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[699:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[699:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[699:23] and you basically did have a major,
[699:27] you know,
[699:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[699:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[699:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[699:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[699:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[699:48] And then it's like, right.
[699:51] Sorry.
[699:52] You're out,
[699:54] and you're not getting any money.
[699:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[700:00] Yes.
[700:01] Do you
[700:02] so my memory
[700:04] around the C++ client was that
[700:06] there were funds to
[700:08] do a security audit
[700:10] for
[700:11] two clients,
[700:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[700:17] Right?
[700:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[700:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[700:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[700:33] I'm not they sure did.
[700:37] You know?
[700:38] You know mean?
[700:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[700:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[700:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[700:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[700:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[701:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[701:11] mid 2015,
[701:12] it's like,
[701:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[701:19] And then
[701:20] that's what happened.
[701:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[701:24] I mean,
[701:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[701:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[701:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[701:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[701:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[701:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[701:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[701:56] as a client,
[701:57] like, died,
[702:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[702:06] It's like, right.
[702:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[702:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[702:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[702:26] across solc,
[702:28] the tests,
[702:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[702:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[702:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[702:48] but
[702:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[702:53] Right?
[702:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[702:58] He was he was building that client.
[703:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[703:05] He was,
[703:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[703:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[703:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[703:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[703:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[703:27] Right?
[703:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[703:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[703:34] closer with Mist,
[703:37] you know, with on Mist.
[703:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[703:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[703:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[703:51] But but, yeah,
[703:53] that would make sense.
[703:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[703:59] And and
[704:00] wait.
[704:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[704:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[704:08] Yeah.
[704:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[704:13] But yeah.
[704:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[704:17] Okay.
[704:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[704:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[704:22] Yes.
[704:23] So, yeah,
[704:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[704:30] you know, for for f.
[704:32] It was called f.
[704:34] It was just called f the executable.
[704:38] So you'd have f and again,
[704:40] yeah, you had f.
[704:42] You had solc.
[704:44] You had
[704:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[704:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[704:50] Acute client.
[704:52] You had,
[704:53] which was the gooey miner.
[704:56] Yeah.
[704:57] That's right.
[704:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[705:05] And then you had one,
[705:07] which was sort of
[705:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[705:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[705:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[705:19] You're running a node,
[705:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[705:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[705:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[705:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[705:41] That's a lot.
[705:43] That that was a lot.
[705:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[705:52] Right?
[705:54] Right.
[705:55] Right.
[705:56] Right.
[705:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[706:00] I mean, when I started,
[706:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[706:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[706:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[706:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[706:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[706:20] Yeah.
[706:22] Dev p two p.
[706:23] Live p two p.
[706:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[706:29] documentation all over the place.
[706:31] I mean You know?
[706:33] I think, you know,
[706:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[706:45] it's like, right.
[706:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[706:51] Right?
[706:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[706:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[707:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[707:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[707:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[707:19] There was no
[707:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[707:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[707:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[707:32] So it's like, right.
[707:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[707:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[707:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[707:50] So yeah,
[707:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[707:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[708:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[708:07] and specifically
[708:09] decoupling
[708:10] and the tests from the client.
[708:14] Right?
[708:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[708:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[708:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[708:32] compiling QT,
[708:35] all of this stuff.
[708:37] So just to get you know?
[708:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[708:44] for Solsea either.
[708:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[708:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[708:55] You have to do all of that.
[708:57] So I remember,
[709:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[709:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[709:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[709:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[709:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[709:20] This is not great.
[709:22] It was my benefit.
[709:25] It's amazing.
[709:27] But, yeah,
[709:28] it was,
[709:30] yeah,
[709:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[709:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[709:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[709:41] coming back,
[709:42] looking at it,
[709:44] saying, like, this can't be
[709:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[709:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[710:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[710:07] you know, but you're right.
[710:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[710:14] You know, talking about that,
[710:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[710:21] and everything.
[710:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[710:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[710:32] because that seems,
[710:34] you know, in an organized way.
[710:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[710:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[710:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[710:45] You know, things as simple as,
[710:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[710:50] like, technical
[710:51] leads that actually lead?
[710:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[710:58] Have we got any IT ?
[711:00] Have we got
[711:02] anything?
[711:03] And it's like, no.
[711:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[711:09] And
[711:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[711:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[711:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[711:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[711:29] Right?
[711:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[711:35] Yeah.
[711:36] You know,
[711:38] I I
[711:39] alright.
[711:42] Okay.
[711:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[711:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[711:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[711:55] but it was kind of similar.

[714:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[714:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[714:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[714:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[714:36] September, October, something like that,
[714:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[714:46] More Jim than me.
[714:48] But so yeah,
[714:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[714:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[714:57] Yep.
[715:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[715:03] Right?
[715:04] I think probably
[715:06] they could have
[715:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[715:14] doing any hedging.
[715:17] And then later,
[715:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[715:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[715:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[715:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[715:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[715:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[715:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[716:03] get people to fight over it,
[716:06] but
[716:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[716:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[716:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[716:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[716:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[716:28] that was the whole world.
[716:30] Right?
[716:31] You know, that was everything,
[716:34] right, was several months
[716:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[716:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[716:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[716:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[716:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[716:55] sorry, 2013.
[717:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[717:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[717:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[717:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[717:20] going on.
[717:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[717:27] so just three further days.
[717:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[717:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[717:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[717:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[717:52] So,
[717:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[718:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[718:03] Oh,
[718:04] sorry.
[718:05] You
[718:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[718:11] Right?
[718:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[718:17] you had,
[718:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[718:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[718:26] Yeah.
[718:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[718:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[718:38] But
[718:39] then, yeah,
[718:40] following that,
[718:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[718:45] onto those teams.
[718:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[718:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[718:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[719:02] And then you
[719:04] and then you guys starting
[719:06] whenever you were starting.
[719:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[719:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[719:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[719:23] and you basically did have a major,
[719:27] you know,
[719:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[719:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[719:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[719:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[719:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[719:48] And then it's like, right.
[719:51] Sorry.
[719:52] You're out,
[719:54] and you're not getting any money.
[719:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[720:00] Yes.
[720:01] Do you
[720:02] so my memory
[720:04] around the C++ client was that
[720:06] there were funds to
[720:08] do a security audit
[720:10] for
[720:11] two clients,
[720:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[720:17] Right?
[720:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[720:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[720:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[720:33] I'm not they sure did.
[720:37] You know?
[720:38] You know mean?
[720:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[720:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[720:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[720:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[720:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[721:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[721:11] mid 2015,
[721:12] it's like,
[721:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[721:19] And then
[721:20] that's what happened.
[721:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[721:24] I mean,
[721:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[721:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[721:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[721:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[721:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[721:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[721:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[721:56] as a client,
[721:57] like, died,
[722:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[722:06] It's like, right.
[722:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[722:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[722:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[722:26] across solc,
[722:28] the tests,
[722:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[722:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[722:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[722:48] but
[722:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[722:53] Right?
[722:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[722:58] He was he was building that client.
[723:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[723:05] He was,
[723:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[723:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[723:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[723:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[723:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[723:27] Right?
[723:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[723:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[723:34] closer with Mist,
[723:37] you know, with on Mist.
[723:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[723:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[723:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[723:51] But but, yeah,
[723:53] that would make sense.
[723:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[723:59] And and
[724:00] wait.
[724:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[724:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[724:08] Yeah.
[724:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[724:13] But yeah.
[724:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[724:17] Okay.
[724:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[724:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[724:22] Yes.
[724:23] So, yeah,
[724:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[724:30] you know, for for f.
[724:32] It was called f.
[724:34] It was just called f the executable.
[724:38] So you'd have f and again,
[724:40] yeah, you had f.
[724:42] You had solc.
[724:44] You had
[724:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[724:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[724:50] Acute client.
[724:52] You had,
[724:53] which was the gooey miner.
[724:56] Yeah.
[724:57] That's right.
[724:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[725:05] And then you had one,
[725:07] which was sort of
[725:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[725:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[725:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[725:19] You're running a node,
[725:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[725:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[725:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[725:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[725:41] That's a lot.
[725:43] That that was a lot.
[725:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[725:52] Right?
[725:54] Right.
[725:55] Right.
[725:56] Right.
[725:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[726:00] I mean, when I started,
[726:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[726:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[726:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[726:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[726:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[726:20] Yeah.
[726:22] Dev p two p.
[726:23] Live p two p.
[726:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[726:29] documentation all over the place.
[726:31] I mean You know?
[726:33] I think, you know,
[726:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[726:45] it's like, right.
[726:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[726:51] Right?
[726:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[726:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[727:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[727:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[727:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[727:19] There was no
[727:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[727:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[727:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[727:32] So it's like, right.
[727:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[727:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[727:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[727:50] So yeah,
[727:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[727:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[728:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[728:07] and specifically
[728:09] decoupling
[728:10] and the tests from the client.
[728:14] Right?
[728:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[728:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[728:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[728:32] compiling QT,
[728:35] all of this stuff.
[728:37] So just to get you know?
[728:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[728:44] for Solsea either.
[728:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[728:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[728:55] You have to do all of that.
[728:57] So I remember,
[729:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[729:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[729:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[729:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[729:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[729:20] This is not great.
[729:22] It was my benefit.
[729:25] It's amazing.
[729:27] But, yeah,
[729:28] it was,
[729:30] yeah,
[729:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[729:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[729:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[729:41] coming back,
[729:42] looking at it,
[729:44] saying, like, this can't be
[729:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[729:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[730:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[730:07] you know, but you're right.
[730:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[730:14] You know, talking about that,
[730:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[730:21] and everything.
[730:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[730:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[730:32] because that seems,
[730:34] you know, in an organized way.
[730:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[730:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[730:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[730:45] You know, things as simple as,
[730:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[730:50] like, technical
[730:51] leads that actually lead?
[730:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[730:58] Have we got any IT ?
[731:00] Have we got
[731:02] anything?
[731:03] And it's like, no.
[731:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[731:09] And
[731:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[731:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[731:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[731:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[731:29] Right?
[731:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[731:35] Yeah.
[731:36] You know,
[731:38] I I
[731:39] alright.
[731:42] Okay.
[731:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[731:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[731:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[731:55] but it was kind of similar.
[731:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[732:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[732:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[732:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[732:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[732:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[732:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[732:37] And but it's, I think,
[732:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[732:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[732:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[732:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[733:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[733:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[733:09] Yeah.
[733:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[733:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[733:18] I was finding these the other day.
[733:21] I was finding the first commits
[733:24] for PyEthereum,
[733:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[733:33] and Go Ethereum.
[733:36] And they were all
[733:37] I think they were all November or December.
[733:41] I think they were all 2013,
[733:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[733:47] Yeah.
[733:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[733:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[733:56] But, you know, that was
[733:58] Yeah.
[733:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[734:03] Right?
[734:04] Yeah.
[734:05] We were much later.
[734:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[734:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[734:13] Yeah.
[734:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[734:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[734:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[734:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[734:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[734:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[734:36] September, October, something like that,
[734:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[734:46] More Jim than me.
[734:48] But so yeah,
[734:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[734:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[734:57] Yep.
[735:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[735:03] Right?
[735:04] I think probably
[735:06] they could have
[735:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[735:14] doing any hedging.
[735:17] And then later,
[735:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[735:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[735:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[735:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[735:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[735:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[735:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[736:03] get people to fight over it,
[736:06] but
[736:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[736:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[736:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[736:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[736:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[736:28] that was the whole world.
[736:30] Right?
[736:31] You know, that was everything,
[736:34] right, was several months
[736:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[736:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[736:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[736:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[736:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[736:55] sorry, 2013.
[737:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[737:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[737:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[737:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[737:20] going on.
[737:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[737:27] so just three further days.
[737:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[737:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[737:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[737:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[737:52] So,
[737:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[738:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[738:03] Oh,
[738:04] sorry.
[738:05] You
[738:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[738:11] Right?
[738:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[738:17] you had,
[738:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[738:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[738:26] Yeah.
[738:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[738:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[738:38] But
[738:39] then, yeah,
[738:40] following that,
[738:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[738:45] onto those teams.
[738:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[738:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[738:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[739:02] And then you
[739:04] and then you guys starting
[739:06] whenever you were starting.
[739:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[739:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[739:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[739:23] and you basically did have a major,
[739:27] you know,
[739:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[739:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[739:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[739:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[739:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[739:48] And then it's like, right.
[739:51] Sorry.
[739:52] You're out,
[739:54] and you're not getting any money.
[739:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[740:00] Yes.
[740:01] Do you
[740:02] so my memory
[740:04] around the C++ client was that
[740:06] there were funds to
[740:08] do a security audit
[740:10] for
[740:11] two clients,
[740:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[740:17] Right?
[740:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[740:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[740:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[740:33] I'm not they sure did.
[740:37] You know?
[740:38] You know mean?
[740:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[740:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[740:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[740:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[740:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[741:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[741:11] mid 2015,
[741:12] it's like,
[741:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[741:19] And then
[741:20] that's what happened.
[741:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[741:24] I mean,
[741:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[741:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[741:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[741:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[741:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[741:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[741:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[741:56] as a client,
[741:57] like, died,
[742:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[742:06] It's like, right.
[742:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[742:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[742:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[742:26] across solc,
[742:28] the tests,
[742:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[742:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[742:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[742:48] but
[742:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[742:53] Right?
[742:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[742:58] He was he was building that client.
[743:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[743:05] He was,
[743:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[743:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[743:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[743:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[743:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[743:27] Right?
[743:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[743:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[743:34] closer with Mist,
[743:37] you know, with on Mist.
[743:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[743:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[743:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[743:51] But but, yeah,
[743:53] that would make sense.
[743:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[743:59] And and
[744:00] wait.
[744:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[744:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[744:08] Yeah.
[744:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[744:13] But yeah.
[744:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[744:17] Okay.
[744:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[744:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[744:22] Yes.
[744:23] So, yeah,
[744:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[744:30] you know, for for f.
[744:32] It was called f.
[744:34] It was just called f the executable.
[744:38] So you'd have f and again,
[744:40] yeah, you had f.
[744:42] You had solc.
[744:44] You had
[744:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[744:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[744:50] Acute client.
[744:52] You had,
[744:53] which was the gooey miner.
[744:56] Yeah.
[744:57] That's right.
[744:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[745:05] And then you had one,
[745:07] which was sort of
[745:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[745:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[745:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[745:19] You're running a node,
[745:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[745:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[745:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[745:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[745:41] That's a lot.
[745:43] That that was a lot.
[745:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[745:52] Right?
[745:54] Right.
[745:55] Right.
[745:56] Right.
[745:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[746:00] I mean, when I started,
[746:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[746:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[746:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[746:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[746:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[746:20] Yeah.
[746:22] Dev p two p.
[746:23] Live p two p.
[746:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[746:29] documentation all over the place.
[746:31] I mean You know?
[746:33] I think, you know,
[746:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[746:45] it's like, right.
[746:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[746:51] Right?
[746:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[746:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[747:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[747:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[747:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[747:19] There was no
[747:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[747:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[747:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[747:32] So it's like, right.
[747:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[747:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[747:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[747:50] So yeah,
[747:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[747:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[748:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[748:07] and specifically
[748:09] decoupling
[748:10] and the tests from the client.
[748:14] Right?
[748:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[748:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[748:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[748:32] compiling QT,
[748:35] all of this stuff.
[748:37] So just to get you know?
[748:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[748:44] for Solsea either.
[748:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[748:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[748:55] You have to do all of that.
[748:57] So I remember,
[749:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[749:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[749:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[749:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[749:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[749:20] This is not great.
[749:22] It was my benefit.
[749:25] It's amazing.
[749:27] But, yeah,
[749:28] it was,
[749:30] yeah,
[749:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[749:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[749:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[749:41] coming back,
[749:42] looking at it,
[749:44] saying, like, this can't be
[749:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[749:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[750:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[750:07] you know, but you're right.
[750:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[750:14] You know, talking about that,
[750:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[750:21] and everything.
[750:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[750:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[750:32] because that seems,
[750:34] you know, in an organized way.
[750:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[750:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[750:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[750:45] You know, things as simple as,
[750:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[750:50] like, technical
[750:51] leads that actually lead?
[750:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[750:58] Have we got any IT ?
[751:00] Have we got
[751:02] anything?
[751:03] And it's like, no.
[751:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[751:09] And
[751:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[751:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[751:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[751:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[751:29] Right?
[751:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[751:35] Yeah.
[751:36] You know,
[751:38] I I
[751:39] alright.
[751:42] Okay.
[751:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[751:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[751:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[751:55] but it was kind of similar.
[751:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[752:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[752:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[752:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[752:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[752:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[752:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[752:37] And but it's, I think,
[752:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[752:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[752:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[752:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[753:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[753:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[753:09] Yeah.
[753:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[753:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[753:18] I was finding these the other day.
[753:21] I was finding the first commits
[753:24] for PyEthereum,
[753:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[753:33] and Go Ethereum.
[753:36] And they were all
[753:37] I think they were all November or December.
[753:41] I think they were all 2013,
[753:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[753:47] Yeah.
[753:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[753:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[753:56] But, you know, that was
[753:58] Yeah.
[753:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[754:03] Right?
[754:04] Yeah.
[754:05] We were much later.
[754:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[754:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[754:13] Yeah.
[754:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[754:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[754:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[754:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[754:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[754:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[754:36] September, October, something like that,
[754:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[754:46] More Jim than me.
[754:48] But so yeah,
[754:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[754:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[754:57] Yep.
[755:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[755:03] Right?
[755:04] I think probably
[755:06] they could have
[755:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[755:14] doing any hedging.
[755:17] And then later,
[755:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[755:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[755:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[755:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[755:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[755:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[755:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[756:03] get people to fight over it,
[756:06] but
[756:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[756:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[756:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[756:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[756:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[756:28] that was the whole world.
[756:30] Right?
[756:31] You know, that was everything,
[756:34] right, was several months
[756:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[756:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[756:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[756:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[756:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[756:55] sorry, 2013.
[757:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[757:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[757:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[757:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[757:20] going on.
[757:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[757:27] so just three further days.
[757:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[757:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[757:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[757:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[757:52] So,
[757:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[758:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[758:03] Oh,
[758:04] sorry.
[758:05] You
[758:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[758:11] Right?
[758:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[758:17] you had,
[758:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[758:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[758:26] Yeah.
[758:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[758:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[758:38] But
[758:39] then, yeah,
[758:40] following that,
[758:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[758:45] onto those teams.
[758:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[758:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[758:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[759:02] And then you
[759:04] and then you guys starting
[759:06] whenever you were starting.
[759:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[759:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[759:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[759:23] and you basically did have a major,
[759:27] you know,
[759:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[759:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[759:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[759:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[759:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[759:48] And then it's like, right.
[759:51] Sorry.
[759:52] You're out,
[759:54] and you're not getting any money.
[759:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[760:00] Yes.
[760:01] Do you
[760:02] so my memory
[760:04] around the C++ client was that
[760:06] there were funds to
[760:08] do a security audit
[760:10] for
[760:11] two clients,
[760:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[760:17] Right?
[760:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[760:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[760:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[760:33] I'm not they sure did.
[760:37] You know?
[760:38] You know mean?
[760:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[760:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[760:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[760:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[760:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[761:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[761:11] mid 2015,
[761:12] it's like,
[761:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[761:19] And then
[761:20] that's what happened.
[761:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[761:24] I mean,
[761:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[761:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[761:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[761:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[761:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[761:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[761:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[761:56] as a client,
[761:57] like, died,
[762:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[762:06] It's like, right.
[762:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[762:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[762:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[762:26] across solc,
[762:28] the tests,
[762:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[762:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[762:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[762:48] but
[762:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[762:53] Right?
[762:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[762:58] He was he was building that client.
[763:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[763:05] He was,
[763:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[763:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[763:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[763:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[763:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[763:27] Right?
[763:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[763:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[763:34] closer with Mist,
[763:37] you know, with on Mist.
[763:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[763:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[763:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[763:51] But but, yeah,
[763:53] that would make sense.
[763:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[763:59] And and
[764:00] wait.
[764:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[764:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[764:08] Yeah.
[764:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[764:13] But yeah.
[764:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[764:17] Okay.
[764:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[764:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[764:22] Yes.
[764:23] So, yeah,
[764:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[764:30] you know, for for f.
[764:32] It was called f.
[764:34] It was just called f the executable.
[764:38] So you'd have f and again,
[764:40] yeah, you had f.
[764:42] You had solc.
[764:44] You had
[764:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[764:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[764:50] Acute client.
[764:52] You had,
[764:53] which was the gooey miner.
[764:56] Yeah.
[764:57] That's right.
[764:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[765:05] And then you had one,
[765:07] which was sort of
[765:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[765:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[765:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[765:19] You're running a node,
[765:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[765:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[765:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[765:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[765:41] That's a lot.
[765:43] That that was a lot.
[765:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[765:52] Right?
[765:54] Right.
[765:55] Right.
[765:56] Right.
[765:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[766:00] I mean, when I started,
[766:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[766:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[766:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[766:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[766:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[766:20] Yeah.
[766:22] Dev p two p.
[766:23] Live p two p.
[766:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[766:29] documentation all over the place.
[766:31] I mean You know?
[766:33] I think, you know,
[766:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[766:45] it's like, right.
[766:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[766:51] Right?
[766:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[766:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[767:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[767:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[767:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[767:19] There was no
[767:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[767:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[767:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[767:32] So it's like, right.
[767:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[767:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[767:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[767:50] So yeah,
[767:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[767:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[768:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[768:07] and specifically
[768:09] decoupling
[768:10] and the tests from the client.
[768:14] Right?
[768:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[768:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[768:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[768:32] compiling QT,
[768:35] all of this stuff.
[768:37] So just to get you know?
[768:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[768:44] for Solsea either.
[768:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[768:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[768:55] You have to do all of that.
[768:57] So I remember,
[769:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[769:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[769:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[769:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[769:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[769:20] This is not great.
[769:22] It was my benefit.
[769:25] It's amazing.
[769:27] But, yeah,
[769:28] it was,
[769:30] yeah,
[769:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[769:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[769:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[769:41] coming back,
[769:42] looking at it,
[769:44] saying, like, this can't be
[769:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[769:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[770:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[770:07] you know, but you're right.
[770:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[770:14] You know, talking about that,
[770:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[770:21] and everything.
[770:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[770:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[770:32] because that seems,
[770:34] you know, in an organized way.
[770:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[770:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[770:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[770:45] You know, things as simple as,
[770:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[770:50] like, technical
[770:51] leads that actually lead?
[770:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[770:58] Have we got any IT ?
[771:00] Have we got
[771:02] anything?
[771:03] And it's like, no.
[771:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[771:09] And
[771:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[771:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[771:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[771:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[771:29] Right?
[771:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[771:35] Yeah.
[771:36] You know,
[771:38] I I
[771:39] alright.
[771:42] Okay.
[771:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[771:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[771:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[771:55] but it was kind of similar.
[771:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[772:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[772:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[772:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[772:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[772:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[772:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[772:37] And but it's, I think,
[772:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[772:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[772:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[772:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[773:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[773:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[773:09] Yeah.
[773:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[773:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[773:18] I was finding these the other day.
[773:21] I was finding the first commits
[773:24] for PyEthereum,
[773:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[773:33] and Go Ethereum.
[773:36] And they were all
[773:37] I think they were all November or December.
[773:41] I think they were all 2013,
[773:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[773:47] Yeah.
[773:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[773:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[773:56] But, you know, that was
[773:58] Yeah.
[773:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[774:03] Right?
[774:04] Yeah.
[774:05] We were much later.
[774:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[774:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[774:13] Yeah.
[774:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[774:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[774:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[774:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[774:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[774:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[774:36] September, October, something like that,
[774:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[774:46] More Jim than me.
[774:48] But so yeah,
[774:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[774:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[774:57] Yep.
[775:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[775:03] Right?
[775:04] I think probably
[775:06] they could have
[775:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[775:14] doing any hedging.
[775:17] And then later,
[775:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[775:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[775:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[775:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[775:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[775:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[775:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[776:03] get people to fight over it,
[776:06] but
[776:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[776:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[776:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[776:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[776:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[776:28] that was the whole world.
[776:30] Right?
[776:31] You know, that was everything,
[776:34] right, was several months
[776:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[776:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[776:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[776:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[776:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[776:55] sorry, 2013.
[777:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[777:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[777:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[777:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[777:20] going on.
[777:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[777:27] so just three further days.
[777:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[777:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[777:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[777:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[777:52] So,
[777:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[778:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[778:03] Oh,
[778:04] sorry.
[778:05] You
[778:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[778:11] Right?
[778:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[778:17] you had,
[778:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[778:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[778:26] Yeah.
[778:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[778:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[778:38] But
[778:39] then, yeah,
[778:40] following that,
[778:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[778:45] onto those teams.
[778:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[778:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[778:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[779:02] And then you
[779:04] and then you guys starting
[779:06] whenever you were starting.
[779:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[779:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[779:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[779:23] and you basically did have a major,
[779:27] you know,
[779:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[779:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[779:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[779:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[779:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[779:48] And then it's like, right.
[779:51] Sorry.
[779:52] You're out,
[779:54] and you're not getting any money.
[779:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[780:00] Yes.
[780:01] Do you
[780:02] so my memory
[780:04] around the C++ client was that
[780:06] there were funds to
[780:08] do a security audit
[780:10] for
[780:11] two clients,
[780:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[780:17] Right?
[780:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[780:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[780:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[780:33] I'm not they sure did.
[780:37] You know?
[780:38] You know mean?
[780:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[780:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[780:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[780:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[780:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[781:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[781:11] mid 2015,
[781:12] it's like,
[781:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[781:19] And then
[781:20] that's what happened.
[781:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[781:24] I mean,
[781:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[781:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[781:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[781:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[781:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[781:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[781:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[781:56] as a client,
[781:57] like, died,
[782:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[782:06] It's like, right.
[782:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[782:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[782:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[782:26] across solc,
[782:28] the tests,
[782:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[782:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[782:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[782:48] but
[782:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[782:53] Right?
[782:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[782:58] He was he was building that client.
[783:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[783:05] He was,
[783:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[783:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[783:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[783:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[783:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[783:27] Right?
[783:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[783:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[783:34] closer with Mist,
[783:37] you know, with on Mist.
[783:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[783:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[783:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[783:51] But but, yeah,
[783:53] that would make sense.
[783:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[783:59] And and
[784:00] wait.
[784:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[784:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[784:08] Yeah.
[784:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[784:13] But yeah.
[784:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[784:17] Okay.
[784:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[784:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[784:22] Yes.
[784:23] So, yeah,
[784:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[784:30] you know, for for f.
[784:32] It was called f.
[784:34] It was just called f the executable.
[784:38] So you'd have f and again,
[784:40] yeah, you had f.
[784:42] You had solc.
[784:44] You had
[784:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[784:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[784:50] Acute client.
[784:52] You had,
[784:53] which was the gooey miner.
[784:56] Yeah.
[784:57] That's right.
[784:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[785:05] And then you had one,
[785:07] which was sort of
[785:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[785:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[785:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[785:19] You're running a node,
[785:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[785:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[785:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[785:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[785:41] That's a lot.
[785:43] That that was a lot.
[785:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[785:52] Right?
[785:54] Right.
[785:55] Right.
[785:56] Right.
[785:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[786:00] I mean, when I started,
[786:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[786:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[786:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[786:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[786:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[786:20] Yeah.
[786:22] Dev p two p.
[786:23] Live p two p.
[786:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[786:29] documentation all over the place.
[786:31] I mean You know?
[786:33] I think, you know,
[786:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[786:45] it's like, right.
[786:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[786:51] Right?
[786:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[786:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[787:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[787:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[787:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[787:19] There was no
[787:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[787:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[787:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[787:32] So it's like, right.
[787:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[787:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[787:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[787:50] So yeah,
[787:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[787:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[788:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[788:07] and specifically
[788:09] decoupling
[788:10] and the tests from the client.
[788:14] Right?
[788:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[788:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[788:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[788:32] compiling QT,
[788:35] all of this stuff.
[788:37] So just to get you know?
[788:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[788:44] for Solsea either.
[788:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[788:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[788:55] You have to do all of that.
[788:57] So I remember,
[789:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[789:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[789:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[789:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[789:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[789:20] This is not great.
[789:22] It was my benefit.
[789:25] It's amazing.
[789:27] But, yeah,
[789:28] it was,
[789:30] yeah,
[789:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[789:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[789:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[789:41] coming back,
[789:42] looking at it,
[789:44] saying, like, this can't be
[789:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[789:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[790:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[790:07] you know, but you're right.
[790:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[790:14] You know, talking about that,
[790:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[790:21] and everything.
[790:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[790:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[790:32] because that seems,
[790:34] you know, in an organized way.
[790:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[790:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[790:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[790:45] You know, things as simple as,
[790:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[790:50] like, technical
[790:51] leads that actually lead?
[790:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[790:58] Have we got any IT ?
[791:00] Have we got
[791:02] anything?
[791:03] And it's like, no.
[791:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[791:09] And
[791:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[791:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[791:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[791:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[791:29] Right?
[791:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[791:35] Yeah.
[791:36] You know,
[791:38] I I
[791:39] alright.
[791:42] Okay.
[791:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[791:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[791:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[791:55] but it was kind of similar.
[791:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[792:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[792:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[792:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[792:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[792:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[792:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[792:37] And but it's, I think,
[792:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[792:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[792:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[792:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[793:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[793:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[793:09] Yeah.
[793:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[793:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[793:18] I was finding these the other day.
[793:21] I was finding the first commits
[793:24] for PyEthereum,
[793:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[793:33] and Go Ethereum.
[793:36] And they were all
[793:37] I think they were all November or December.
[793:41] I think they were all 2013,
[793:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[793:47] Yeah.
[793:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[793:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[793:56] But, you know, that was
[793:58] Yeah.
[793:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[794:03] Right?
[794:04] Yeah.
[794:05] We were much later.
[794:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[794:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[794:13] Yeah.
[794:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[794:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[794:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[794:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[794:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[794:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[794:36] September, October, something like that,
[794:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[794:46] More Jim than me.
[794:48] But so yeah,
[794:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[794:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[794:57] Yep.
[795:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[795:03] Right?
[795:04] I think probably
[795:06] they could have
[795:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[795:14] doing any hedging.
[795:17] And then later,
[795:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[795:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[795:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[795:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[795:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[795:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[795:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[796:03] get people to fight over it,
[796:06] but
[796:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[796:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[796:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[796:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[796:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[796:28] that was the whole world.
[796:30] Right?
[796:31] You know, that was everything,
[796:34] right, was several months
[796:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[796:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[796:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[796:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[796:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[796:55] sorry, 2013.
[797:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[797:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[797:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[797:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[797:20] going on.
[797:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[797:27] so just three further days.
[797:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[797:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[797:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[797:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[797:52] So,
[797:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[798:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[798:03] Oh,
[798:04] sorry.
[798:05] You
[798:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[798:11] Right?
[798:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[798:17] you had,
[798:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[798:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[798:26] Yeah.
[798:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[798:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[798:38] But
[798:39] then, yeah,
[798:40] following that,
[798:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[798:45] onto those teams.
[798:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[798:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[798:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[799:02] And then you
[799:04] and then you guys starting
[799:06] whenever you were starting.
[799:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[799:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[799:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[799:23] and you basically did have a major,
[799:27] you know,
[799:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[799:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[799:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[799:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[799:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[799:48] And then it's like, right.
[799:51] Sorry.
[799:52] You're out,
[799:54] and you're not getting any money.
[799:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[800:00] Yes.
[800:01] Do you
[800:02] so my memory
[800:04] around the C++ client was that
[800:06] there were funds to
[800:08] do a security audit
[800:10] for
[800:11] two clients,
[800:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[800:17] Right?
[800:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[800:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[800:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[800:33] I'm not they sure did.
[800:37] You know?
[800:38] You know mean?
[800:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[800:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[800:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[800:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[800:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[801:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[801:11] mid 2015,
[801:12] it's like,
[801:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[801:19] And then
[801:20] that's what happened.
[801:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[801:24] I mean,
[801:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[801:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[801:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[801:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[801:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[801:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[801:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[801:56] as a client,
[801:57] like, died,
[802:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[802:06] It's like, right.
[802:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[802:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[802:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[802:26] across solc,
[802:28] the tests,
[802:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[802:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[802:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[802:48] but
[802:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[802:53] Right?
[802:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[802:58] He was he was building that client.
[803:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[803:05] He was,
[803:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[803:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[803:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[803:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[803:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[803:27] Right?
[803:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[803:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[803:34] closer with Mist,
[803:37] you know, with on Mist.
[803:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[803:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[803:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[803:51] But but, yeah,
[803:53] that would make sense.
[803:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[803:59] And and
[804:00] wait.
[804:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[804:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[804:08] Yeah.
[804:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[804:13] But yeah.
[804:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[804:17] Okay.
[804:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[804:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[804:22] Yes.
[804:23] So, yeah,
[804:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[804:30] you know, for for f.
[804:32] It was called f.
[804:34] It was just called f the executable.
[804:38] So you'd have f and again,
[804:40] yeah, you had f.
[804:42] You had solc.
[804:44] You had
[804:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[804:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[804:50] Acute client.
[804:52] You had,
[804:53] which was the gooey miner.
[804:56] Yeah.
[804:57] That's right.
[804:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[805:05] And then you had one,
[805:07] which was sort of
[805:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[805:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[805:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[805:19] You're running a node,
[805:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[805:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[805:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[805:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[805:41] That's a lot.
[805:43] That that was a lot.
[805:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[805:52] Right?
[805:54] Right.
[805:55] Right.
[805:56] Right.
[805:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[806:00] I mean, when I started,
[806:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[806:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[806:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[806:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[806:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[806:20] Yeah.
[806:22] Dev p two p.
[806:23] Live p two p.
[806:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[806:29] documentation all over the place.
[806:31] I mean You know?
[806:33] I think, you know,
[806:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[806:45] it's like, right.
[806:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[806:51] Right?
[806:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[806:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[807:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[807:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[807:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[807:19] There was no
[807:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[807:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[807:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[807:32] So it's like, right.
[807:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[807:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[807:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[807:50] So yeah,
[807:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[807:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[808:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[808:07] and specifically
[808:09] decoupling
[808:10] and the tests from the client.
[808:14] Right?
[808:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[808:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[808:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[808:32] compiling QT,
[808:35] all of this stuff.
[808:37] So just to get you know?
[808:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[808:44] for Solsea either.
[808:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[808:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[808:55] You have to do all of that.
[808:57] So I remember,
[809:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[809:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[809:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[809:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[809:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[809:20] This is not great.
[809:22] It was my benefit.
[809:25] It's amazing.
[809:27] But, yeah,
[809:28] it was,
[809:30] yeah,
[809:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[809:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[809:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[809:41] coming back,
[809:42] looking at it,
[809:44] saying, like, this can't be
[809:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[809:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[810:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[810:07] you know, but you're right.
[810:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[810:14] You know, talking about that,
[810:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[810:21] and everything.
[810:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[810:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[810:32] because that seems,
[810:34] you know, in an organized way.
[810:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[810:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[810:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[810:45] You know, things as simple as,
[810:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[810:50] like, technical
[810:51] leads that actually lead?
[810:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[810:58] Have we got any IT ?
[811:00] Have we got
[811:02] anything?
[811:03] And it's like, no.
[811:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[811:09] And
[811:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[811:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[811:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[811:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[811:29] Right?
[811:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[811:35] Yeah.
[811:36] You know,
[811:38] I I
[811:39] alright.
[811:42] Okay.
[811:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[811:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[811:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[811:55] but it was kind of similar.
[811:58] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[812:02] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[812:07] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[812:12] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[812:19] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[812:26] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[812:31] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[812:37] And but it's, I think,
[812:39] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[812:44] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[812:51] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[812:56] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[813:02] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[813:05] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[813:09] Yeah.
[813:10] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[813:13] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[813:18] I was finding these the other day.
[813:21] I was finding the first commits
[813:24] for PyEthereum,
[813:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[813:33] and Go Ethereum.
[813:36] And they were all
[813:37] I think they were all November or December.
[813:41] I think they were all 2013,
[813:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[813:47] Yeah.
[813:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[813:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[813:56] But, you know, that was
[813:58] Yeah.
[813:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[814:03] Right?
[814:04] Yeah.
[814:05] We were much later.
[814:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[814:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[814:13] Yeah.
[814:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[814:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[814:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[814:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[814:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[814:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[814:36] September, October, something like that,
[814:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[814:46] More Jim than me.
[814:48] But so yeah,
[814:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[814:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[814:57] Yep.
[815:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[815:03] Right?
[815:04] I think probably
[815:06] they could have
[815:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[815:14] doing any hedging.
[815:17] And then later,
[815:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[815:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[815:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[815:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[815:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[815:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[815:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[816:03] get people to fight over it,
[816:06] but
[816:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[816:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[816:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[816:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[816:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[816:28] that was the whole world.
[816:30] Right?
[816:31] You know, that was everything,
[816:34] right, was several months
[816:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[816:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[816:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[816:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[816:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[816:55] sorry, 2013.
[817:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[817:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[817:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[817:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[817:20] going on.
[817:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[817:27] so just three further days.
[817:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[817:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[817:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[817:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[817:52] So,
[817:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[818:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[818:03] Oh,
[818:04] sorry.
[818:05] You
[818:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[818:11] Right?
[818:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[818:17] you had,
[818:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[818:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[818:26] Yeah.
[818:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[818:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[818:38] But
[818:39] then, yeah,
[818:40] following that,
[818:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[818:45] onto those teams.
[818:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[818:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[818:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[819:02] And then you
[819:04] and then you guys starting
[819:06] whenever you were starting.
[819:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[819:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[819:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[819:23] and you basically did have a major,
[819:27] you know,
[819:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[819:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[819:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[819:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[819:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[819:48] And then it's like, right.
[819:51] Sorry.
[819:52] You're out,
[819:54] and you're not getting any money.
[819:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[820:00] Yes.
[820:01] Do you
[820:02] so my memory
[820:04] around the C++ client was that
[820:06] there were funds to
[820:08] do a security audit
[820:10] for
[820:11] two clients,
[820:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[820:17] Right?
[820:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[820:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[820:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[820:33] I'm not they sure did.
[820:37] You know?
[820:38] You know mean?
[820:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[820:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[820:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[820:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[820:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[821:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[821:11] mid 2015,
[821:12] it's like,
[821:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[821:19] And then
[821:20] that's what happened.
[821:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[821:24] I mean,
[821:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[821:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[821:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[821:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[821:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[821:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[821:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[821:56] as a client,
[821:57] like, died,
[822:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[822:06] It's like, right.
[822:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[822:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[822:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[822:26] across solc,
[822:28] the tests,
[822:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[822:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[822:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[822:48] but
[822:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[822:53] Right?
[822:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[822:58] He was he was building that client.
[823:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[823:05] He was,
[823:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[823:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[823:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[823:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[823:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[823:27] Right?
[823:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[823:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[823:34] closer with Mist,
[823:37] you know, with on Mist.
[823:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[823:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[823:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[823:51] But but, yeah,
[823:53] that would make sense.
[823:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[823:59] And and
[824:00] wait.
[824:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[824:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[824:08] Yeah.
[824:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[824:13] But yeah.
[824:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[824:17] Okay.
[824:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[824:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[824:22] Yes.
[824:23] So, yeah,
[824:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[824:30] you know, for for f.
[824:32] It was called f.
[824:34] It was just called f the executable.
[824:38] So you'd have f and again,
[824:40] yeah, you had f.
[824:42] You had solc.
[824:44] You had
[824:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[824:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[824:50] Acute client.
[824:52] You had,
[824:53] which was the gooey miner.
[824:56] Yeah.
[824:57] That's right.
[824:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[825:05] And then you had one,
[825:07] which was sort of
[825:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[825:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[825:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[825:19] You're running a node,
[825:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[825:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[825:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[825:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[825:41] That's a lot.
[825:43] That that was a lot.
[825:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[825:52] Right?
[825:54] Right.
[825:55] Right.
[825:56] Right.
[825:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[826:00] I mean, when I started,
[826:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[826:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[826:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[826:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[826:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[826:20] Yeah.
[826:22] Dev p two p.
[826:23] Live p two p.
[826:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[826:29] documentation all over the place.
[826:31] I mean You know?
[826:33] I think, you know,
[826:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[826:45] it's like, right.
[826:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[826:51] Right?
[826:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[826:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[827:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[827:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[827:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[827:19] There was no
[827:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[827:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[827:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[827:32] So it's like, right.
[827:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[827:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[827:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[827:50] So yeah,
[827:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[827:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[828:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[828:07] and specifically
[828:09] decoupling
[828:10] and the tests from the client.
[828:14] Right?
[828:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[828:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[828:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[828:32] compiling QT,
[828:35] all of this stuff.
[828:37] So just to get you know?
[828:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[828:44] for Solsea either.
[828:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[828:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[828:55] You have to do all of that.
[828:57] So I remember,
[829:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[829:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[829:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[829:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[829:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[829:20] This is not great.
[829:22] It was my benefit.
[829:25] It's amazing.
[829:27] But, yeah,
[829:28] it was,
[829:30] yeah,
[829:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[829:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[829:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[829:41] coming back,
[829:42] looking at it,
[829:44] saying, like, this can't be
[829:48] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[829:53] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[830:00] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[830:07] you know, but you're right.
[830:09] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**

[830:16] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[830:21] and everything.
[830:23] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[830:28] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[830:32] because that seems,
[830:34] you know, in an organized way.
[830:37] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[830:39] You know, you're the status quo.
[830:41] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[830:45] You know, things as simple as,
[830:47] like, like, you know, have we got,
[830:50] like, technical
[830:51] leads that actually lead?
[830:53] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[830:58] Have we got any IT ?
[831:00] Have we got
[831:02] anything?
[831:03] And it's like, no.
[831:05] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[831:09] And
[831:10] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[831:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[831:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[831:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[831:29] Right?
[831:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[831:35] Yeah.
[831:36] You know,
[831:38] I I
[831:39] alright.
[831:42] Okay.
[831:43] That's a it's a good strong point.
[831:46] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[831:50] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,

[833:21] I was finding the first commits
[833:24] for PyEthereum,
[833:26] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[833:33] and Go Ethereum.
[833:36] And they were all
[833:37] I think they were all November or December.
[833:41] I think they were all 2013,
[833:44] not even 2014 for those three.
[833:47] Yeah.
[833:48] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[833:53] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[833:56] But, you know, that was
[833:58] Yeah.
[833:59] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[834:03] Right?
[834:04] Yeah.
[834:05] We were much later.
[834:08] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[834:11] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[834:13] Yeah.
[834:14] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[834:17] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[834:21] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[834:25] I got to know the project pretty well.
[834:28] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[834:32] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[834:36] September, October, something like that,
[834:41] and we started work more or less right away.
[834:46] More Jim than me.
[834:48] But so yeah,
[834:50] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[834:54] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[834:57] Yep.
[835:00] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[835:03] Right?
[835:04] I think probably
[835:06] they could have
[835:07] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[835:14] doing any hedging.
[835:17] And then later,
[835:20] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[835:26] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[835:31] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[835:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[835:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[835:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[835:56] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[836:03] get people to fight over it,
[836:06] but
[836:07] it it probably overcorrected,
[836:10] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[836:15] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[836:19] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[836:24] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[836:28] that was the whole world.
[836:30] Right?
[836:31] You know, that was everything,
[836:34] right, was several months
[836:39] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[836:44] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[836:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[836:49] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[836:51] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[836:55] sorry, 2013.
[837:00] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[837:04] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[837:09] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[837:15] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[837:20] going on.
[837:22] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[837:27] so just three further days.
[837:31] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[837:36] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[837:42] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[837:47] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[837:52] So,
[837:53] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[838:00] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[838:03] Oh,
[838:04] sorry.
[838:05] You
[838:06] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[838:11] Right?
[838:12] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[838:17] you had,
[838:18] you know, money for early contributors,
[838:23] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[838:26] Yeah.
[838:27] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[838:32] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[838:38] But
[838:39] then, yeah,
[838:40] following that,
[838:42] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[838:45] onto those teams.
[838:47] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[838:53] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[838:59] you know, that that never got funded.
[839:02] And then you
[839:04] and then you guys starting
[839:06] whenever you were starting.
[839:08] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[839:14] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[839:19] you know, when when that team spun out
[839:23] and you basically did have a major,
[839:27] you know,
[839:28] rapidly load-bearing client,
[839:30] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[839:34] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[839:38] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[839:43] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[839:48] And then it's like, right.
[839:51] Sorry.
[839:52] You're out,
[839:54] and you're not getting any money.
[839:57] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[840:00] Yes.
[840:01] Do you
[840:02] so my memory
[840:04] around the C++ client was that
[840:06] there were funds to
[840:08] do a security audit
[840:10] for
[840:11] two clients,
[840:12] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[840:17] Right?
[840:19] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[840:24] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[840:30] but I'm not quite sure.
[840:33] I'm not they sure did.
[840:37] You know?
[840:38] You know mean?
[840:39] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[840:42] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[840:46] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[840:51] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[840:57] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[841:04] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[841:11] mid 2015,
[841:12] it's like,
[841:14] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[841:19] And then
[841:20] that's what happened.
[841:21] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[841:24] I mean,
[841:25] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[841:32] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[841:38] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[841:41] But the Go client was more stable.
[841:44] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[841:49] it was often in an unstable situation.
[841:52] So even when C++ Ethereum
[841:56] as a client,
[841:57] like, died,
[842:00] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[842:06] It's like, right.
[842:08] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[842:14] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[842:21] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[842:26] across solc,
[842:28] the tests,
[842:29] and C++ Ethereum.
[842:31] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[842:42] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[842:48] but
[842:49] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[842:53] Right?
[842:54] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[842:58] He was he was building that client.
[843:02] He was writing the yellow paper.
[843:05] He was,
[843:07] you know, working there with Christian and
[843:10] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[843:14] You know, all of that was was there.
[843:19] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[843:23] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[843:27] Right?
[843:28] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[843:31] And and that that Geth team were working
[843:34] closer with Mist,
[843:37] you know, with on Mist.
[843:40] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[843:46] You know, it's like Yeah.
[843:48] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[843:51] But but, yeah,
[843:53] that would make sense.
[843:55] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[843:59] And and
[844:00] wait.
[844:02] So see the Solidity compiler.
[844:05] That was part of that C++ group too?
[844:08] Yeah.
[844:09] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[844:13] But yeah.
[844:14] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[844:17] Okay.
[844:18] I remember web three umbrella.
[844:20] I remember the web three umbrella.
[844:22] Yes.
[844:23] So, yeah,
[844:25] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[844:30] you know, for for f.
[844:32] It was called f.
[844:34] It was just called f the executable.
[844:38] So you'd have f and again,
[844:40] yeah, you had f.
[844:42] You had solc.
[844:44] You had
[844:45] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[844:48] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[844:50] Acute client.
[844:52] You had,
[844:53] which was the gooey miner.
[844:56] Yeah.
[844:57] That's right.
[844:58] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[845:05] And then you had one,
[845:07] which was sort of
[845:08] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[845:14] I can't remember the exact scope,
[845:16] but but it was sort of like, right.
[845:19] You're running a node,
[845:22] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[845:25] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[845:32] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[845:39] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[845:41] That's a lot.
[845:43] That that was a lot.
[845:45] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[845:52] Right?
[845:54] Right.
[845:55] Right.
[845:56] Right.
[845:57] But then they were all really codependent.
[846:00] I mean, when I started,
[846:02] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[846:08] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[846:11] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[846:14] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[846:17] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[846:20] Yeah.
[846:22] Dev p two p.
[846:23] Live p two p.
[846:24] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[846:29] documentation all over the place.
[846:31] I mean You know?
[846:33] I think, you know,
[846:37] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[846:45] it's like, right.
[846:47] Let's try and make this modular.
[846:51] Right?
[846:52] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[846:59] But it was it was pulled apart
[847:04] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[847:11] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[847:15] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[847:19] There was no
[847:20] interplace discipline on any of it.
[847:23] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[847:27] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[847:32] So it's like, right.
[847:34] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[847:41] like, that wasn't atomic.
[847:43] It was it was just a big old mess.
[847:50] So yeah,
[847:51] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[847:58] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[848:02] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[848:07] and specifically
[848:09] decoupling
[848:10] and the tests from the client.
[848:14] Right?
[848:15] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[848:21] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[848:27] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[848:32] compiling QT,
[848:35] all of this stuff.
[848:37] So just to get you know?
[848:40] And and there weren't binaries available
[848:44] for Solsea either.
[848:47] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[848:53] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[848:55] You have to do all of that.
[848:57] So I remember,
[849:00] you know, after all that decomposition,
[849:04] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[849:07] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[849:11] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[849:18] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[849:20] This is not great.
[849:22] It was my benefit.
[849:25] It's amazing.
[849:27] But, yeah,
[849:28] it was,
[849:30] yeah,
[849:31] it was a bit of a mess.
[849:34] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[849:37] you know, many times trying to build things,
[850:00] coming back,
[850:01] looking at it,
[850:02] saying, like, this can't be
[850:06] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[850:11] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[850:18] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[850:25] you know, but you're right.
[850:27] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[850:32] You know, talking about that,
[850:34] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[850:39] and everything.
[850:41] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[850:46] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[850:49] because that seems,
[850:51] you know, in an organized way.
[850:54] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[850:56] You know, you're the status quo.
[850:58] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[851:02] You know, things as simple as,
[851:04] like, like, you know, have we got,
[851:07] like, technical
[851:08] leads that actually lead?
[851:10] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[851:15] Have we got any IT ?
[851:17] Have we got
[851:19] anything?
[851:20] And it's like, no.
[851:22] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[851:26] And
[851:27] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[851:34] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[851:37] That was seen as a good thing,
[851:40] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[851:45] Right?
[851:46] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[851:51] Yeah.
[851:52] You know,
[851:54] I I
[851:55] alright.
[851:58] Okay.
[852:00] That's a it's a good strong point.
[852:03] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[852:07] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[852:12] but it was kind of similar.
[852:15] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[852:20] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[852:25] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[852:30] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[852:37] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[852:44] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[852:49] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[852:55] And but it's, I think,
[852:57] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[853:02] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[853:09] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[853:14] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[853:19] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[853:22] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[853:26] Yeah.
[853:27] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[853:30] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[853:35] I was finding these the other day.
[853:38] I was finding the first commits
[853:41] for PyEthereum,
[853:43] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[853:50] and Go Ethereum.
[853:53] And they were all
[853:54] I think they were all November or December.
[853:58] I think they were all 2013,
[854:01] not even 2014 for those three.
[854:04] Yeah.
[854:05] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[854:10] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[854:13] But, you know, that was
[854:15] Yeah.
[854:16] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[854:20] Right?
[854:21] Yeah.
[854:22] We were much later.
[854:25] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[854:29] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[854:31] Yeah.
[854:32] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[854:35] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[854:39] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[854:43] I got to know the project pretty well.
[854:46] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[854:50] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[854:54] September, October, something like that,
[854:59] and we started work more or less right away.
[855:04] More Jim than me.
[855:06] But so yeah,
[855:08] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[855:12] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[855:15] Yep.
[855:18] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[855:21] Right?
[855:22] I think probably
[855:24] they could have
[855:25] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[855:32] doing any hedging.
[855:35] And then later,
[855:38] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[855:44] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[855:49] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[855:56] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[856:01] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[856:06] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[856:15] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[856:22] get people to fight over it,
[856:25] but
[856:26] it it probably overcorrected,
[856:29] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[856:34] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[856:38] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[856:43] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[856:47] that was the whole world.
[856:49] Right?
[856:50] You know, that was everything,
[856:53] right, was several months
[856:58] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[857:03] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[857:07] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[857:08] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[857:10] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[857:14] sorry, 2013.
[857:19] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[857:23] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[857:28] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[857:34] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[857:39] going on.
[857:41] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[857:46] so just three further days.
[857:50] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[857:55] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[858:01] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[858:06] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[858:11] So,
[858:12] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[858:19] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[858:22] Oh,
[858:23] sorry.
[858:24] You
[858:25] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[858:31] Right?
[858:32] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[858:37] you had,
[858:38] you know, money for early contributors,
[858:43] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[858:46] Yeah.
[858:47] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[858:52] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[858:58] But
[858:59] then, yeah,
[860:00] following that,
[860:02] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[860:05] onto those teams.
[860:07] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[860:13] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[860:19] you know, that that never got funded.
[860:22] And then you
[860:24] and then you guys starting
[860:26] whenever you were starting.
[860:28] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[860:34] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[860:39] you know, when when that team spun out
[860:43] and you basically did have a major,
[860:47] you know,
[860:48] rapidly load-bearing client,
[860:50] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[860:54] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[860:58] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[861:03] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[861:08] And then it's like, right.
[861:11] Sorry.
[861:12] You're out,
[861:14] and you're not getting any money.
[861:17] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[861:20] Yes.
[861:21] Do you
[861:23] so my memory
[861:25] around the C++ client was that
[861:27] there were funds to
[861:29] do a security audit
[861:31] for
[861:32] two clients,
[861:33] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[861:38] Right?
[861:40] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[861:45] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[861:51] but I'm not quite sure.
[861:54] I'm not they sure did.
[861:58] You know?
[862:00] You know mean?
[862:01] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[862:04] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[862:08] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[862:13] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[862:19] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[862:26] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[862:33] mid 2015,
[862:34] it's like,
[862:36] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[862:41] And then
[862:42] that's what happened.
[862:43] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[862:46] I mean,
[862:47] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[862:54] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[863:00] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[863:03] But the Go client was more stable.
[863:06] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[863:11] it was often in an unstable situation.
[863:14] So even when C++ Ethereum
[863:18] as a client,
[863:19] like, died,
[863:22] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[863:28] It's like, right.
[863:30] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[863:36] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[863:43] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[863:48] across solc,
[863:50] the tests,
[863:51] and C++ Ethereum.
[863:53] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[864:04] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[864:10] but
[864:11] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[864:15] Right?
[864:16] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[864:20] He was he was building that client.
[864:23] He was writing the yellow paper.
[864:26] He was,
[864:28] you know, working there with Christian and
[864:31] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[864:35] You know, all of that was was there.
[864:40] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[864:44] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[864:48] Right?
[864:49] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[864:52] And and that that Geth team were working
[864:55] closer with Mist,
[864:58] you know, with on Mist.
[865:01] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[865:07] You know, it's like Yeah.
[865:09] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[865:12] But but, yeah,
[865:14] that would make sense.
[865:16] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[865:19] And and
[865:20] wait.
[865:22] So see the Solidity compiler.
[865:25] That was part of that C++ group too?
[865:28] Yeah.
[865:29] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[865:33] But yeah.
[865:34] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[865:37] Okay.
[865:38] I remember web three umbrella.
[865:40] I remember the web three umbrella.
[865:42] Yes.
[865:43] So, yeah,
[865:45] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[865:50] you know, for for f.
[865:52] It was called f.
[865:54] It was just called f the executable.
[865:58] So you'd have f and again,
[866:00] yeah, you had f.
[866:02] You had solc.
[866:04] You had
[866:05] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[866:08] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[866:10] Acute client.
[866:12] You had,
[866:13] which was the gooey miner.
[866:16] Yeah.
[866:17] That's right.
[866:18] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[866:25] And then you had one,
[866:27] which was sort of
[866:28] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[866:34] I can't remember the exact scope,
[866:36] but but it was sort of like, right.
[866:39] You're running a node,
[866:42] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[866:45] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[866:52] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[866:59] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[867:01] That's a lot.
[867:03] That that was a lot.
[867:05] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[867:12] Right?
[867:14] Right.
[867:15] Right.
[867:16] Right.
[867:17] But then they were all really codependent.
[867:20] I mean, when I started,
[867:22] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[867:28] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[867:31] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[867:34] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[867:37] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[867:40] Yeah.
[867:42] Dev p two p.
[867:43] Live p two p.
[867:44] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[867:49] documentation all over the place.
[867:51] I mean You know?
[867:53] I think, you know,
[867:57] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[868:05] it's like, right.
[868:07] Let's try and make this modular.
[868:11] Right?
[868:12] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[868:19] But it was it was pulled apart
[868:24] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[868:31] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[868:35] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[868:39] There was no
[868:40] interplace discipline on any of it.
[868:43] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[868:47] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[868:52] So it's like, right.
[868:54] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[869:01] like, that wasn't atomic.
[869:03] It was it was just a big old mess.
[869:10] So yeah,
[869:11] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[869:18] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[869:22] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[869:27] and specifically
[869:29] decoupling
[869:30] and the tests from the client.
[869:34] Right?
[869:35] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[869:41] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[869:47] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[869:52] compiling QT,
[869:55] all of this stuff.
[869:57] So just to get you know?
[869:60] And and there weren't binaries available
[869:64] for Solsea either.
[869:67] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[869:73] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[869:75] You have to do all of that.
[869:77] So I remember,
[869:80] you know, after all that decomposition,
[869:84] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[869:87] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[869:91] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[869:98] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[870:00] This is not great.
[870:02] It was my benefit.
[870:05] It's amazing.
[870:07] But, yeah,
[870:08] it was,
[870:10] yeah,
[870:11] it was a bit of a mess.
[870:14] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[870:17] you know, many times trying to build things,
[870:20] coming back,
[870:21] looking at it,
[870:23] saying, like, this can't be
[870:27] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[870:32] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[870:39] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[870:46] you know, but you're right.
[870:48] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[870:53] You know, talking about that,
[870:55] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[871:00] and everything.
[871:02] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[871:07] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[871:10] because that seems,
[871:12] you know, in an organized way.
[871:15] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[871:17] You know, you're the status quo.
[871:19] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[871:23] You know, things as simple as,
[871:25] like, like, you know, have we got,
[871:28] like, technical
[871:29] leads that actually lead?
[871:31] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[871:36] Have we got any IT ?
[871:38] Have we got
[871:40] anything?
[871:41] And it's like, no.
[871:43] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[871:47] And
[871:48] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[871:56] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[872:00] That was seen as a good thing,
[872:03] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[872:08] Right?
[872:09] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[872:14] Yeah.
[872:15] You know,
[872:17] I I
[872:18] alright.
[872:21] Okay.
[872:22] That's a it's a good strong point.
[872:25] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[872:29] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[872:34] but it was kind of similar.
[872:37] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[872:42] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[872:47] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[872:52] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[872:59] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[873:06] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[873:11] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[873:17] And but it's, I think,
[873:19] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[873:24] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[873:31] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[873:36] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[873:41] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[873:44] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[873:48] Yeah.
[873:49] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[873:52] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[873:57] I was finding these the other day.
[874:00] I was finding the first commits
[874:03] for PyEthereum,
[874:05] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[874:12] and Go Ethereum.
[874:15] And they were all
[874:16] I think they were all November or December.
[874:20] I think they were all 2013,
[874:23] not even 2014 for those three.
[874:26] Yeah.
[874:27] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[874:32] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[874:35] But, you know, that was
[874:37] Yeah.
[874:38] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[874:42] Right?
[874:43] Yeah.
[874:44] We were much later.
[874:47] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[874:51] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[874:53] Yeah.
[874:54] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[874:57] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[875:01] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[875:05] I got to know the project pretty well.
[875:08] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[875:12] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[875:16] September, October, something like that,
[875:21] and we started work more or less right away.
[875:26] More Jim than me.
[875:28] But so yeah,
[875:30] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[875:34] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[875:37] Yep.
[875:40] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[875:43] Right?
[875:44] I think probably
[875:46] they could have
[875:47] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[875:54] doing any hedging.
[875:57] And then later,
[876:00] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[876:06] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[876:11] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[876:18] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[876:23] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[876:28] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[876:37] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[876:44] get people to fight over it,
[876:47] but
[876:48] it it probably overcorrected,
[876:51] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[876:56] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[877:00] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[877:05] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[877:09] that was the whole world.
[877:11] Right?
[877:12] You know, that was everything,
[877:15] right, was several months
[877:20] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[877:25] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[877:29] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[877:30] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[877:32] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[877:36] sorry, 2013.
[877:41] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[877:45] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[877:50] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[877:56] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[878:01] going on.
[878:03] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[878:08] so just three further days.
[878:12] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[878:17] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[878:23] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[878:28] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[878:33] So,
[878:34] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[878:41] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[878:44] Oh,
[878:45] sorry.
[878:46] You
[878:47] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[878:53] Right?
[878:54] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[878:59] you had,
[879:00] you know, money for early contributors,
[879:05] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[879:08] Yeah.
[879:09] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[879:14] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[879:20] But
[879:21] then, yeah,
[879:22] following that,
[879:25] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[879:28] onto those teams.
[879:30] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[879:36] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[879:42] you know, that that never got funded.
[879:45] And then you
[879:47] and then you guys starting
[879:49] whenever you were starting.
[879:51] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[879:56] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[879:61] you know, when when that team spun out
[879:65] and you basically did have a major,
[879:69] you know,
[879:70] rapidly load-bearing client,
[879:72] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[879:76] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[879:80] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[879:85] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[879:90] And then it's like, right.
[879:93] Sorry.
[879:94] You're out,
[879:96] and you're not getting any money.
[879:99] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[880:02] Yes.
[880:03] Do you
[880:05] so my memory
[880:07] around the C++ client was that
[880:09] there were funds to
[880:11] do a security audit
[880:13] for
[880:14] two clients,
[880:15] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[880:20] Right?
[880:22] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[880:27] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[880:33] but I'm not quite sure.
[880:36] I'm not they sure did.
[880:40] You know?
[880:41] You know mean?
[880:42] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[880:45] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[880:49] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[880:54] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[881:00] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[881:07] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[881:14] mid 2015,
[881:15] it's like,
[881:17] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[881:22] And then
[881:23] that's what happened.
[881:24] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[881:27] I mean,
[881:28] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[881:35] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[881:41] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[881:44] But the Go client was more stable.
[881:47] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[881:52] it was often in an unstable situation.
[881:55] So even when C++ Ethereum
[881:59] as a client,
[882:00] like, died,
[882:03] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[882:09] It's like, right.
[882:11] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[882:17] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[882:24] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[882:29] across solc,
[882:31] the tests,
[882:32] and C++ Ethereum.
[882:34] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[882:45] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[882:51] but
[882:52] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[882:56] Right?
[882:57] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[883:01] He was he was building that client.
[883:04] He was writing the yellow paper.
[883:07] He was,
[883:09] you know, working there with Christian and
[883:12] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[883:16] You know, all of that was was there.
[883:21] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[883:25] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[883:29] Right?
[883:30] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[883:33] And and that that Geth team were working
[883:36] closer with Mist,
[883:39] you know, with on Mist.
[883:42] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[883:48] You know, it's like Yeah.
[883:50] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[883:53] But but, yeah,
[883:55] that would make sense.
[883:57] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[884:00] And and
[884:01] wait.
[884:03] So see the Solidity compiler.
[884:06] That was part of that C++ group too?
[884:09] Yeah.
[884:10] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[884:14] But yeah.
[884:15] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[884:18] Okay.
[884:19] I remember web three umbrella.
[884:21] I remember the web three umbrella.
[884:23] Yes.
[884:24] So, yeah,
[884:26] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[884:31] you know, for for f.
[884:33] It was called f.
[884:35] It was just called f the executable.
[884:39] So you'd have f and again,
[884:41] yeah, you had f.
[884:43] You had solc.
[884:45] You had
[884:46] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[884:49] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[884:51] Acute client.
[884:53] You had,
[884:54] which was the gooey miner.
[884:57] Yeah.
[884:58] That's right.
[885:00] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[885:07] And then you had one,
[885:09] which was sort of
[885:10] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[885:16] I can't remember the exact scope,
[885:18] but but it was sort of like, right.
[885:21] You're running a node,
[885:24] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[885:27] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[885:34] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[885:41] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[885:43] That's a lot.
[885:45] That that was a lot.
[885:47] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[885:54] Right?
[885:56] Right.
[885:57] Right.
[885:58] Right.
[885:59] But then they were all really codependent.
[886:02] I mean, when I started,
[886:04] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[886:10] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[886:13] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[886:16] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[886:19] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[886:22] Yeah.
[886:24] Dev p two p.
[886:25] Live p two p.
[886:26] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[886:31] documentation all over the place.
[886:33] I mean You know?
[886:35] I think, you know,
[886:39] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[887:07] it's like, right.
[887:10] Let's try and make this modular.
[887:14] Right?
[887:15] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[887:22] But it was it was pulled apart
[887:27] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[887:34] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[887:38] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[887:42] There was no
[887:43] interplace discipline on any of it.
[887:46] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[887:50] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[887:55] So it's like, right.
[887:57] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[888:04] like, that wasn't atomic.
[888:06] It was it was just a big old mess.
[888:13] So yeah,
[888:14] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[888:21] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[888:25] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[888:30] and specifically
[888:32] decoupling
[888:33] and the tests from the client.
[888:37] Right?
[888:38] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[888:45] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[888:51] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[888:56] compiling QT,
[889:00] all of this stuff.
[889:02] So just to get you know?
[889:05] And and there weren't binaries available
[889:10] for Solsea either.
[889:13] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[889:19] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[889:21] You have to do all of that.
[889:23] So I remember,
[889:26] you know, after all that decomposition,
[889:30] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[889:33] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[889:37] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[889:44] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[889:46] This is not great.
[889:48] It was my benefit.
[889:51] It's amazing.
[889:53] But, yeah,
[889:54] it was,
[889:56] yeah,
[889:57] it was a bit of a mess.
[889:59] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[890:02] you know, many times trying to build things,
[890:05] coming back,
[890:06] looking at it,
[890:08] saying, like, this can't be
[890:12] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[890:17] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[890:24] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[890:31] you know, but you're right.
[890:33] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[890:38] You know, talking about that,
[890:40] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[890:45] and everything.
[890:47] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[890:52] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[890:55] because that seems,
[891:00] you know, in an organized way.
[891:03] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[891:05] You know, you're the status quo.
[891:07] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[891:11] You know, things as simple as,
[891:13] like, like, you know, have we got,
[891:16] like, technical
[891:17] leads that actually lead?
[891:19] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[891:24] Have we got any IT ?
[891:26] Have we got
[891:28] anything?
[891:29] And it's like, no.
[891:31] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[891:35] And
[891:36] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[891:43] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[891:46] That was seen as a good thing,
[891:49] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[891:54] Right?
[891:55] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[892:00] Yeah.
[892:01] You know,
[892:03] I I
[892:04] alright.
[892:07] Okay.
[892:08] That's a it's a good strong point.
[892:11] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[892:15] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[892:20] but it was kind of similar.
[892:23] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[892:28] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[892:33] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[892:38] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[892:45] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[892:52] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[892:57] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[893:03] And but it's, I think,
[893:05] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[893:10] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[893:17] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[893:22] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[893:27] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[893:30] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[893:34] Yeah.
[893:35] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[893:38] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[893:43] I was finding these the other day.
[893:46] I was finding the first commits
[893:49] for PyEthereum,
[893:51] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[894:00] and Go Ethereum.
[894:03] And they were all
[894:04] I think they were all November or December.
[894:08] I think they were all 2013,
[894:11] not even 2014 for those three.
[894:15] Yeah.
[894:16] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[894:21] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[894:24] But, you know, that was
[894:26] Yeah.
[894:27] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[894:31] Right?
[894:32] Yeah.
[894:33] We were much later.
[894:36] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[894:40] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[894:42] Yeah.
[894:43] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[894:46] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[894:50] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[894:54] I got to know the project pretty well.
[894:57] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[895:01] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[895:05] September, October, something like that,
[895:10] and we started work more or less right away.
[895:15] More Jim than me.
[895:17] But so yeah,
[895:19] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[895:23] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[895:26] Yep.
[895:29] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[895:32] Right?
[895:33] I think probably
[895:35] they could have
[895:36] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[895:43] doing any hedging.
[895:46] And then later,
[895:49] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[895:55] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[896:00] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[896:07] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[896:12] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[896:17] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[896:26] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[896:33] get people to fight over it,
[896:36] but
[896:37] it it probably overcorrected,
[896:40] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[896:45] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[896:49] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[896:54] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[896:58] that was the whole world.
[897:00] Right?
[897:01] You know, that was everything,
[897:04] right, was several months
[897:09] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[897:14] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[897:18] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[897:19] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[897:21] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[897:25] sorry, 2013.
[897:30] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[897:34] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[897:39] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[897:45] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[897:50] going on.
[897:52] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[897:57] so just three further days.
[898:01] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[898:06] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[898:12] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[898:17] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[898:22] So,
[898:23] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[898:30] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[898:33] Oh,
[898:34] sorry.
[898:35] You
[898:36] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[898:42] Right?
[898:43] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[898:48] you had,
[898:49] you know, money for early contributors,
[898:54] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[898:57] Yeah.
[898:58] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[899:03] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[899:09] But
[899:10] then, yeah,
[899:12] following that,
[899:15] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[899:18] onto those teams.
[899:20] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[899:26] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[899:32] you know, that that never got funded.
[899:35] And then you
[899:37] and then you guys starting
[899:39] whenever you were starting.
[899:41] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[899:46] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[899:52] you know, when when that team spun out
[899:56] and you basically did have a major,
[899:60] you know,
[899:61] rapidly load-bearing client,
[899:63] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[899:67] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[899:71] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[899:76] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[899:81] And then it's like, right.
[899:84] Sorry.
[899:85] You're out,
[899:87] and you're not getting any money.
[899:90] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[899:93] Yes.
[899:94] Do you
[899:96] so my memory
[899:98] around the C++ client was that
[899:100] there were funds to
[899:102] do a security audit
[899:104] for
[899:105] two clients,
[899:106] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[899:111] Right?
[899:113] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[899:118] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[899:24] but I'm not quite sure.
[899:27] I'm not they sure did.
[899:30] You know?
[899:31] You know mean?
[899:32] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[899:35] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[899:39] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[899:44] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[899:50] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[899:57] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[900:04] mid 2015,
[900:05] it's like,
[900:07] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[900:12] And then
[900:13] that's what happened.
[900:14] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[900:17] I mean,
[900:18] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[900:25] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[900:31] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[900:34] But the Go client was more stable.
[900:37] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[900:42] it was often in an unstable situation.
[900:45] So even when C++ Ethereum
[900:49] as a client,
[900:50] like, died,
[900:53] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[901:00] It's like, right.
[901:02] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[901:08] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[901:15] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[901:20] across solc,
[901:22] the tests,
[901:23] and C++ Ethereum.
[901:25] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[901:36] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[901:42] but
[901:43] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[901:47] Right?
[901:48] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[901:52] He was he was building that client.
[901:55] He was writing the yellow paper.
[901:58] He was,
[902:00] you know, working there with Christian and
[902:03] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[902:07] You know, all of that was was there.
[902:12] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[902:16] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[902:20] Right?
[902:21] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[902:24] And and that that Geth team were working
[902:27] closer with Mist,
[902:30] you know, with on Mist.
[902:33] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[902:39] You know, it's like Yeah.
[902:41] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[902:44] But but, yeah,
[902:46] that would make sense.
[902:48] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[902:51] And and
[902:52] wait.
[902:54] So see the Solidity compiler.
[902:57] That was part of that C++ group too?
[903:00] Yeah.
[903:01] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[903:05] But yeah.
[903:06] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[903:09] Okay.
[903:10] I remember web three umbrella.
[903:12] I remember the web three umbrella.
[903:14] Yes.
[903:15] So, yeah,
[903:17] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[903:22] you know, for for f.
[903:24] It was called f.
[903:26] It was just called f the executable.
[903:30] So you'd have f and again,
[903:32] yeah, you had f.
[903:34] You had solc.
[903:36] You had
[903:37] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[903:41] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[903:43] Acute client.
[903:45] You had,
[903:46] which was the gooey miner.
[903:49] Yeah.
[903:50] That's right.
[903:51] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[903:58] And then you had one,
[904:00] which was sort of
[904:01] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[904:07] I can't remember the exact scope,
[904:09] but but it was sort of like, right.
[904:12] You're running a node,
[904:15] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[904:18] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[904:25] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[904:32] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[904:34] That's a lot.
[904:36] That that was a lot.
[904:38] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[904:45] Right?
[904:47] Right.
[904:48] Right.
[904:49] Right.
[904:50] But then they were all really codependent.
[904:53] I mean, when I started,
[904:55] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[905:01] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[905:04] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[905:07] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[905:10] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[905:13] Yeah.
[905:15] Dev p two p.
[905:16] Live p two p.
[905:17] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[905:22] documentation all over the place.
[905:24] I mean You know?
[905:26] I think, you know,
[905:30] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[905:38] it's like, right.
[905:41] Let's try and make this modular.
[905:45] Right?
[905:46] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[905:53] But it was it was pulled apart
[906:00] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[906:07] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[906:11] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[906:15] There was no
[906:16] interplace discipline on any of it.
[906:20] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[906:24] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[906:30] So it's like, right.
[906:32] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[906:39] like, that wasn't atomic.
[906:41] It was it was just a big old mess.
[906:48] So yeah,
[906:49] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[907:06] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[907:10] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[907:15] and specifically
[907:17] decoupling
[907:18] and the tests from the client.
[907:22] Right?
[907:23] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[907:29] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[907:35] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[907:40] compiling QT,
[907:44] all of this stuff.
[907:46] So just to get you know?
[907:49] And and there weren't binaries available
[907:54] for Solsea either.
[907:57] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[908:03] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[908:05] You have to do all of that.
[908:07] So I remember,
[908:10] you know, after all that decomposition,
[908:14] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[908:17] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[908:21] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[908:28] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[908:30] This is not great.
[908:32] It was my benefit.
[908:35] It's amazing.
[908:37] But, yeah,
[908:38] it was,
[908:40] yeah,
[908:41] it was a bit of a mess.
[908:43] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[908:46] you know, many times trying to build things,
[908:49] coming back,
[908:50] looking at it,
[908:52] saying, like, this can't be
[908:56] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[909:01] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[909:08] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[909:15] you know, but you're right.
[909:17] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[909:22] You know, talking about that,
[909:24] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[909:29] and everything.
[909:31] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[909:36] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[909:39] because that seems,
[909:41] you know, in an organized way.
[909:44] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[909:46] You know, you're the status quo.
[909:48] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[909:52] You know, things as simple as,
[909:54] like, like, you know, have we got,
[909:57] like, technical
[909:58] leads that actually lead?
[910:00] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[910:05] Have we got any IT ?
[910:07] Have we got
[910:09] anything?
[910:10] And it's like, no.
[910:12] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[910:16] And
[910:17] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[910:24] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[910:27] That was seen as a good thing,
[910:30] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[910:35] Right?
[910:36] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[910:41] Yeah.
[910:42] You know,
[910:44] I I
[910:45] alright.
[910:48] Okay.
[910:49] That's a it's a good strong point.
[910:52] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[910:56] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[911:01] but it was kind of similar.
[911:04] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[911:09] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[911:14] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[911:19] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[911:26] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[911:33] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[911:38] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[911:44] And but it's, I think,
[911:46] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[911:51] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[912:00] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[912:06] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[912:11] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[912:14] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[912:18] Yeah.
[912:19] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[912:22] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[912:27] I was finding these the other day.
[912:30] I was finding the first commits
[912:33] for PyEthereum,
[912:35] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[912:42] and Go Ethereum.
[912:45] And they were all
[912:46] I think they were all November or December.
[912:50] I think they were all 2013,
[912:53] not even 2014 for those three.
[912:57] Yeah.
[912:58] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[913:03] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[913:06] But, you know, that was
[913:08] Yeah.
[913:09] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[913:13] Right?
[913:14] Yeah.
[913:15] We were much later.
[913:18] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[913:22] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[913:24] Yeah.
[913:25] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[913:28] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[913:32] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[913:36] I got to know the project pretty well.
[913:39] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[913:43] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[913:47] September, October, something like that,
[913:52] and we started work more or less right away.
[913:56] More Jim than me.
[913:58] But so yeah,
[914:00] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[914:04] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[914:07] Yep.
[914:10] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[914:13] Right?
[914:14] I think probably
[914:16] they could have
[914:17] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[914:24] doing any hedging.
[914:27] And then later,
[914:30] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[914:36] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[914:41] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[914:48] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[914:53] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[914:58] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[915:07] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[915:14] get people to fight over it,
[915:17] but
[915:18] it it probably overcorrected,
[915:21] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[915:26] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[915:30] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[915:35] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[915:39] that was the whole world.
[915:41] Right?
[915:42] You know, that was everything,
[915:45] right, was several months
[915:50] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[915:55] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[916:00] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[916:01] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[916:03] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[916:07] sorry, 2013.
[916:12] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[916:16] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[916:21] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[916:27] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[916:32] going on.
[916:34] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[916:39] so just three further days.
[916:43] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[916:48] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[916:54] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[917:00] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[917:05] So,
[917:06] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[917:13] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[917:16] Oh,
[917:17] sorry.
[917:18] You
[917:19] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[917:25] Right?
[917:26] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[917:31] you had,
[917:32] you know, money for early contributors,
[917:37] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[917:40] Yeah.
[917:41] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[917:46] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[917:52] But
[917:53] then, yeah,
[917:55] following that,
[918:00] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[918:03] onto those teams.
[918:05] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[918:11] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[918:17] you know, that that never got funded.
[918:20] And then you
[918:22] and then you guys starting
[918:24] whenever you were starting.
[918:26] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[918:31] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[918:37] you know, when when that team spun out
[918:41] and you basically did have a major,
[918:45] you know,
[918:46] rapidly load-bearing client,
[918:48] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[918:52] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[918:56] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[919:01] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[919:06] And then it's like, right.
[919:09] Sorry.
[919:10] You're out,
[919:12] and you're not getting any money.
[919:15] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[919:18] Yes.
[919:19] Do you
[919:21] so my memory
[919:23] around the C++ client was that
[919:25] there were funds to
[919:27] do a security audit
[919:29] for
[919:30] two clients,
[919:31] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[919:36] Right?
[919:38] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[919:43] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[919:49] but I'm not quite sure.
[919:52] I'm not they sure did.
[919:56] You know?
[919:57] You know mean?
[920:00] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[920:03] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[920:07] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[920:12] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[920:18] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[920:25] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[920:32] mid 2015,
[920:33] it's like,
[920:35] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[920:40] And then
[920:41] that's what happened.
[920:42] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[920:45] I mean,
[920:46] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[921:02] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[921:08] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[921:11] But the Go client was more stable.
[921:14] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[921:19] it was often in an unstable situation.
[921:22] So even when C++ Ethereum
[921:26] as a client,
[921:27] like, died,
[921:30] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[921:36] It's like, right.
[921:38] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[921:44] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[921:51] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[921:56] across solc,
[921:58] the tests,
[921:59] and C++ Ethereum.
[922:01] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[922:12] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[922:18] but
[922:19] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[922:23] Right?
[922:24] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[922:28] He was he was building that client.
[922:31] He was writing the yellow paper.
[922:34] He was,
[922:36] you know, working there with Christian and
[922:39] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[922:43] You know, all of that was was there.
[922:48] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[922:52] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[922:56] Right?
[922:57] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[923:00] And and that that Geth team were working
[923:03] closer with Mist,
[923:06] you know, with on Mist.
[923:09] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[923:15] You know, it's like Yeah.
[923:17] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[923:20] But but, yeah,
[923:22] that would make sense.
[923:24] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[923:27] And and
[923:28] wait.
[923:30] So see the Solidity compiler.
[923:33] That was part of that C++ group too?
[923:36] Yeah.
[923:37] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[923:41] But yeah.
[923:42] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[923:45] Okay.
[923:46] I remember web three umbrella.
[923:48] I remember the web three umbrella.
[923:50] Yes.
[923:51] So, yeah,
[923:53] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[923:58] you know, for for f.
[924:00] It was called f.
[924:02] It was just called f the executable.
[924:06] So you'd have f and again,
[924:08] yeah, you had f.
[924:10] You had solc.
[924:12] You had
[924:13] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[924:17] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[924:19] Acute client.
[924:21] You had,
[924:22] which was the gooey miner.
[924:25] Yeah.
[924:26] That's right.
[924:27] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[924:34] And then you had one,
[924:36] which was sort of
[924:37] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[924:43] I can't remember the exact scope,
[924:45] but but it was sort of like, right.
[924:48] You're running a node,
[924:51] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[924:54] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[925:01] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[925:08] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[925:10] That's a lot.
[925:12] That that was a lot.
[925:14] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[925:21] Right?
[925:23] Right.
[925:24] Right.
[925:25] Right.
[925:26] But then they were all really codependent.
[925:29] I mean, when I started,
[925:31] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[925:37] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[925:40] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[925:43] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[925:46] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[925:49] Yeah.
[925:51] Dev p two p.
[925:52] Live p two p.
[925:53] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[926:00] documentation all over the place.
[926:02] I mean You know?
[926:04] I think, you know,
[926:08] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[927:15] it's like, right.
[927:18] Let's try and make this modular.
[927:22] Right?
[927:23] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[927:30] But it was it was pulled apart

[927:46] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[927:50] There was no
[927:51] interplace discipline on any of it.
[927:54] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[928:00] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[928:06] So it's like, right.
[928:08] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[928:15] like, that wasn't atomic.
[928:17] It was it was just a big old mess.
[928:24] So yeah,
[928:25] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[928:32] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[928:36] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[928:41] and specifically
[928:43] decoupling
[928:44] and the tests from the client.
[928:48] Right?
[928:49] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[928:56] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[929:02] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[929:07] compiling QT,
[929:11] all of this stuff.
[929:13] So just to get you know?
[929:16] And and there weren't binaries available
[929:21] for Solsea either.
[929:24] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[929:30] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[929:32] You have to do all of that.
[929:34] So I remember,
[929:37] you know, after all that decomposition,
[929:41] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[929:44] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[929:48] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[930:05] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[930:07] This is not great.
[930:09] It was my benefit.
[930:12] It's amazing.
[930:14] But, yeah,
[930:15] it was,
[930:17] yeah,
[930:18] it was a bit of a mess.
[930:20] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[930:23] you know, many times trying to build things,
[930:26] coming back,
[930:27] looking at it,
[930:29] saying, like, this can't be
[930:33] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[930:38] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[931:05] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[931:12] you know, but you're right.
[931:14] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[931:19] You know, talking about that,
[931:21] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[931:26] and everything.
[931:28] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[931:33] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[931:36] because that seems,
[931:38] you know, in an organized way.
[931:41] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[931:43] You know, you're the status quo.
[931:45] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[931:49] You know, things as simple as,
[931:51] like, like, you know, have we got,
[931:54] like, technical
[931:55] leads that actually lead?
[931:57] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[932:02] Have we got any IT ?
[932:04] Have we got
[932:06] anything?
[932:07] And it's like, no.
[932:09] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[932:13] And
[932:14] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[932:21] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[932:24] That was seen as a good thing,
[932:27] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[932:32] Right?
[932:33] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[932:38] Yeah.
[932:40] You know,
[932:42] I I
[932:43] alright.
[932:46] Okay.
[932:47] That's a it's a good strong point.
[932:50] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[932:54] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[932:59] but it was kind of similar.
[933:02] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[933:07] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[933:12] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[933:17] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[933:24] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[933:31] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[933:36] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[933:42] And but it's, I think,
[933:44] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[933:49] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[933:56] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[934:02] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[934:07] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[934:10] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[934:14] Yeah.
[934:15] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[934:18] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[934:23] I was finding these the other day.
[934:26] I was finding the first commits
[934:29] for PyEthereum,
[934:31] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[934:38] and Go Ethereum.
[934:41] And they were all
[934:42] I think they were all November or December.
[934:46] I think they were all 2013,
[934:49] not even 2014 for those three.
[934:53] Yeah.
[934:54] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[934:59] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[935:02] But, you know, that was
[935:04] Yeah.
[935:05] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[935:10] Right?
[935:11] Yeah.
[935:12] We were much later.
[935:15] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[935:19] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[935:21] Yeah.
[935:22] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[935:25] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[935:29] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[935:33] I got to know the project pretty well.
[935:36] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[935:40] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[935:44] September, October, something like that,
[935:49] and we started work more or less right away.
[935:53] More Jim than me.
[935:55] But so yeah,
[935:57] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[936:01] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[936:04] Yep.
[936:07] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[936:10] Right?
[936:11] I think probably
[936:13] they could have
[936:14] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[936:21] doing any hedging.
[936:24] And then later,
[936:27] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[936:33] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[936:38] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[936:45] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[936:50] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[936:55] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[937:04] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[937:11] get people to fight over it,
[937:14] but
[937:15] it it probably overcorrected,
[937:18] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[937:23] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[937:27] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[937:32] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[937:36] that was the whole world.
[937:38] Right?
[937:39] You know, that was everything,
[937:42] right, was several months
[937:47] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[937:52] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[938:01] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[938:02] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[938:04] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[938:08] sorry, 2013.
[938:13] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[938:17] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[938:22] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[938:28] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[938:33] going on.
[938:35] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[938:40] so just three further days.
[938:44] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[938:49] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[938:55] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[939:00] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[939:05] So,
[939:06] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[939:13] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[939:16] Oh,
[939:17] sorry.
[939:18] You
[939:19] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[939:25] Right?
[939:26] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[939:31] you had,
[939:32] you know, money for early contributors,
[939:37] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[939:40] Yeah.
[939:41] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[939:46] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[939:52] But
[939:53] then, yeah,
[939:55] following that,
[940:00] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[940:03] onto those teams.
[940:05] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[940:11] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[940:17] you know, that that never got funded.
[940:20] And then you
[940:22] and then you guys starting
[940:24] whenever you were starting.
[940:26] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[940:31] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[940:37] you know, when when that team spun out
[940:41] and you basically did have a major,
[940:45] you know,
[940:46] rapidly load-bearing client,
[940:48] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[940:52] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[940:56] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[941:01] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[941:06] And then it's like, right.
[941:09] Sorry.
[941:10] You're out,
[941:12] and you're not getting any money.
[941:15] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[941:18] Yes.
[941:19] Do you
[941:21] so my memory
[941:23] around the C++ client was that
[941:25] there were funds to
[941:27] do a security audit
[941:29] for
[941:30] two clients,
[941:31] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[941:36] Right?
[941:38] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[941:43] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[941:49] but I'm not quite sure.
[941:52] I'm not they sure did.
[941:56] You know?
[941:57] You know mean?
[942:00] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[942:03] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[942:07] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[942:12] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[942:18] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[942:25] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[942:32] mid 2015,
[942:33] it's like,
[942:35] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[942:40] And then
[942:41] that's what happened.
[942:42] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[942:45] I mean,
[942:46] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[942:53] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[943:00] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[943:03] But the Go client was more stable.
[943:06] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[943:11] it was often in an unstable situation.
[943:14] So even when C++ Ethereum
[943:18] as a client,
[943:19] like, died,
[943:22] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[943:28] It's like, right.
[943:30] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[943:36] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[943:43] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[943:48] across solc,
[943:50] the tests,
[943:51] and C++ Ethereum.
[943:53] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[944:04] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[944:10] but
[944:11] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[944:15] Right?
[944:16] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[944:20] He was he was building that client.
[944:23] He was writing the yellow paper.
[944:26] He was,
[944:28] you know, working there with Christian and
[944:31] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[944:35] You know, all of that was was there.
[944:40] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[944:44] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[944:48] Right?
[944:49] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[944:52] And and that that Geth team were working
[944:55] closer with Mist,
[944:58] you know, with on Mist.
[945:01] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[945:07] You know, it's like Yeah.
[945:09] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[945:12] But but, yeah,
[945:14] that would make sense.
[945:16] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[945:19] And and
[945:20] wait.
[945:22] So see the Solidity compiler.
[945:25] That was part of that C++ group too?
[945:28] Yeah.
[945:29] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[945:33] But yeah.
[945:34] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[945:37] Okay.
[945:38] I remember web three umbrella.
[945:40] I remember the web three umbrella.
[945:42] Yes.
[945:43] So, yeah,
[945:45] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[945:50] you know, for for f.
[945:52] It was called f.
[945:54] It was just called f the executable.
[946:01] So you'd have f and again,
[946:03] yeah, you had f.
[946:05] You had solc.
[946:07] You had
[946:08] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[946:12] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[946:14] Acute client.
[946:16] You had,
[946:17] which was the gooey miner.
[946:20] Yeah.
[946:21] That's right.
[946:22] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[946:29] And then you had one,
[946:31] which was sort of
[946:32] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[946:38] I can't remember the exact scope,
[946:40] but but it was sort of like, right.
[946:43] You're running a node,
[946:46] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[946:49] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[947:06] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[947:13] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[947:15] That's a lot.
[947:17] That that was a lot.
[947:19] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[947:26] Right?
[947:28] Right.
[947:29] Right.
[947:30] Right.
[947:31] But then they were all really codependent.
[947:34] I mean, when I started,
[947:36] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[948:02] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[948:05] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[948:08] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[948:11] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[948:14] Yeah.
[948:16] Dev p two p.
[948:17] Live p two p.
[948:18] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[948:23] documentation all over the place.
[948:25] I mean You know?
[948:27] I think, you know,
[948:31] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[949:00] it's like, right.
[949:03] Let's try and make this modular.
[949:07] Right?
[949:08] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[949:15] But it was it was pulled apart
[949:20] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[949:27] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[949:31] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[949:35] There was no
[949:36] interplace discipline on any of it.
[949:40] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[949:44] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[949:50] So it's like, right.
[949:52] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[950:00] like, that wasn't atomic.
[950:02] It was it was just a big old mess.
[950:09] So yeah,
[950:10] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[950:17] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[950:21] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[950:26] and specifically
[950:28] decoupling
[950:29] and the tests from the client.
[950:33] Right?
[950:34] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[950:41] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[950:47] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[950:52] compiling QT,
[950:56] all of this stuff.
[950:58] So just to get you know?
[951:01] And and there weren't binaries available
[951:06] for Solsea either.
[951:09] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[951:15] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[951:17] You have to do all of that.
[951:19] So I remember,
[951:22] you know, after all that decomposition,
[951:26] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[951:29] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[951:33] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[951:40] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[951:42] This is not great.
[951:44] It was my benefit.
[951:47] It's amazing.
[951:49] But, yeah,
[951:50] it was,
[951:52] yeah,
[951:53] it was a bit of a mess.
[951:55] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[951:58] you know, many times trying to build things,
[952:01] coming back,
[952:02] looking at it,
[952:04] saying, like, this can't be
[952:08] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[952:13] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[952:20] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[952:27] you know, but you're right.
[952:29] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[952:34] You know, talking about that,
[952:36] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[952:41] and everything.
[952:43] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[952:48] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[952:51] because that seems,
[952:53] you know, in an organized way.
[952:56] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[952:58] You know, you're the status quo.
[953:00] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[953:04] You know, things as simple as,
[953:06] like, like, you know, have we got,
[953:09] like, technical
[953:10] leads that actually lead?
[953:12] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[953:17] Have we got any IT ?
[953:19] Have we got
[953:21] anything?
[953:22] And it's like, no.
[953:24] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[953:28] And
[953:29] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[953:36] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[953:39] That was seen as a good thing,
[953:42] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[953:47] Right?
[953:48] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[953:53] Yeah.
[953:55] You know,
[953:57] I I
[953:58] alright.
[954:01] Okay.
[954:02] That's a it's a good strong point.
[954:05] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[954:09] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[954:14] but it was kind of similar.
[954:17] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[954:22] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[954:27] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[954:32] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[954:39] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[954:46] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[954:51] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[954:57] And but it's, I think,
[955:00] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[955:05] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[955:12] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[955:17] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[955:22] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[955:25] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[955:29] Yeah.
[955:30] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[955:33] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[955:38] I was finding these the other day.
[955:41] I was finding the first commits
[955:44] for PyEthereum,
[955:46] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[955:53] and Go Ethereum.
[955:56] And they were all
[955:57] I think they were all November or December.
[956:01] I think they were all 2013,
[956:04] not even 2014 for those three.
[956:08] Yeah.
[956:09] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[956:14] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[956:17] But, you know, that was
[956:19] Yeah.
[956:20] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[956:25] Right?
[956:26] Yeah.
[956:27] We were much later.
[956:30] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[956:34] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[956:36] Yeah.
[956:37] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[956:40] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[956:44] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[956:48] I got to know the project pretty well.
[956:51] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[956:55] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[957:00] September, October, something like that,
[957:05] and we started work more or less right away.
[957:09] More Jim than me.
[957:11] But so yeah,
[957:13] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[957:16] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[957:20] Yep.
[957:23] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[957:26] Right?
[957:27] I think probably
[957:29] they could have
[957:30] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[958:01] doing any hedging.
[958:04] And then later,
[958:07] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[958:13] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[958:18] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[958:25] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[958:30] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[958:35] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[958:44] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[958:51] get people to fight over it,
[958:54] but
[958:55] it it probably overcorrected,
[958:58] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[960:02] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[960:07] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[960:12] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[960:16] that was the whole world.
[960:18] Right?
[960:19] You know, that was everything,
[960:22] right, was several months
[960:27] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[960:32] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[961:04] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[961:05] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[961:07] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[961:11] sorry, 2013.
[961:16] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[961:21] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[961:26] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[961:31] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[961:36] going on.
[961:38] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[961:43] so just three further days.
[961:47] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[961:52] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[962:00] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[962:05] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[962:10] So,
[962:11] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[962:18] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[962:21] Oh,
[962:22] sorry.
[962:23] You
[962:24] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[962:30] Right?
[962:31] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[962:36] you had,
[962:37] you know, money for early contributors,
[962:42] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[962:45] Yeah.
[962:46] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[962:51] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[962:57] But
[962:58] then, yeah,
[963:00] following that,
[963:05] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[963:08] onto those teams.
[963:10] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[963:16] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[963:22] you know, that that never got funded.
[963:25] And then you
[963:27] and then you guys starting
[963:29] whenever you were starting.
[963:31] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[963:36] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[963:42] you know, when when that team spun out
[963:46] and you basically did have a major,
[963:48] you know,
[963:49] rapidly load-bearing client,
[963:51] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[963:55] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[963:59] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[964:04] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[964:09] And then it's like, right.
[964:12] Sorry.
[964:13] You're out,
[964:15] and you're not getting any money.
[964:18] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[964:21] Yes.
[964:22] Do you
[964:24] so my memory
[964:26] around the C++ client was that
[964:28] there were funds to
[964:30] do a security audit
[964:32] for
[964:33] two clients,
[964:34] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[964:39] Right?
[964:41] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[964:46] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[964:52] but I'm not quite sure.
[964:55] I'm not they sure did.
[964:58] You know?
[964:59] You know mean?
[965:02] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[965:05] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[965:09] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[965:14] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[965:20] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[965:27] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[965:34] mid 2015,
[965:35] it's like,
[965:37] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[965:42] And then
[965:43] that's what happened.
[965:44] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[965:47] I mean,
[965:48] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[965:54] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[966:00] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[966:03] But the Go client was more stable.
[966:06] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[966:11] it was often in an unstable situation.
[966:14] So even when C++ Ethereum
[966:18] as a client,
[966:19] like, died,
[966:22] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[966:28] It's like, right.
[966:30] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[966:36] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[966:43] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[966:48] across solc,
[966:50] the tests,
[966:51] and C++ Ethereum.
[966:53] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[967:04] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[967:10] but
[967:11] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[967:15] Right?
[967:16] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[967:20] He was he was building that client.
[967:23] He was writing the yellow paper.
[967:26] He was,
[967:28] you know, working there with Christian and
[967:31] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[967:35] You know, all of that was was there.
[967:40] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[967:44] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[967:48] Right?
[967:49] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[967:52] And and that that Geth team were working
[967:55] closer with Mist,
[967:58] you know, with on Mist.
[968:01] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[968:07] You know, it's like Yeah.
[968:09] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[968:12] But but, yeah,
[968:14] that would make sense.
[968:16] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[968:19] And and
[968:20] wait.
[968:22] So see the Solidity compiler.
[968:25] That was part of that C++ group too?
[968:28] Yeah.
[968:29] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[968:33] But yeah.
[968:34] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[968:37] Okay.
[968:38] I remember web three umbrella.
[968:40] I remember the web three umbrella.
[968:42] Yes.
[968:43] So, yeah,
[968:45] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[968:50] you know, for for f.
[968:52] It was called f.
[968:54] It was just called f the executable.
[969:01] So you'd have f and again,
[969:03] yeah, you had f.
[969:05] You had solc.
[969:07] You had
[969:08] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[969:12] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[969:14] Acute client.
[969:16] You had,
[969:17] which was the gooey miner.
[969:20] Yeah.
[969:21] That's right.
[969:22] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[969:29] And then you had one,
[969:31] which was sort of
[969:32] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[969:38] I can't remember the exact scope,
[969:40] but but it was sort of like, right.
[969:43] You're running a node,
[969:46] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[969:49] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[970:06] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[970:13] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[970:15] That's a lot.
[970:17] That that was a lot.
[970:19] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[970:26] Right?
[970:28] Right.
[970:29] Right.
[970:30] Right.
[970:31] But then they were all really codependent.
[970:34] I mean, when I started,
[970:36] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[970:42] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[971:08] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[971:11] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[971:14] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[971:17] Yeah.
[971:19] Dev p two p.
[971:20] Live p two p.
[971:21] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[971:26] documentation all over the place.
[971:28] I mean You know?
[971:30] I think, you know,
[971:34] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[972:41] it's like, right.
[972:44] Let's try and make this modular.
[972:48] Right?
[972:49] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[973:05] But it was it was pulled apart
[973:10] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[973:17] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[973:21] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[973:25] There was no
[973:26] interplace discipline on any of it.
[973:30] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[973:34] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[973:40] So it's like, right.
[973:42] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[973:49] like, that wasn't atomic.
[973:51] It was it was just a big old mess.
[974:08] So yeah,
[974:09] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[974:16] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[974:20] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[974:25] and specifically
[974:27] decoupling
[974:28] and the tests from the client.
[974:32] Right?
[974:33] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[974:40] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[974:46] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[974:51] compiling QT,
[974:55] all of this stuff.
[974:57] So just to get you know?
[975:00] And and there weren't binaries available
[975:05] for Solsea either.
[975:08] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[975:14] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[975:16] You have to do all of that.
[975:18] So I remember,
[975:21] you know, after all that decomposition,
[975:25] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[975:28] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[975:32] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[975:49] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[975:51] This is not great.
[975:53] It was my benefit.
[975:56] It's amazing.
[975:58] But, yeah,
[976:00] it was,
[976:02] yeah,
[976:03] it was a bit of a mess.
[976:05] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[976:10] you know, many times trying to build things,
[976:13] coming back,
[976:14] looking at it,
[976:16] saying, like, this can't be
[976:20] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[976:25] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[976:32] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[976:39] you know, but you're right.
[976:41] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[976:46] You know, talking about that,
[976:48] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[976:53] and everything.
[976:55] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[976:59] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[977:02] because that seems,
[977:04] you know, in an organized way.
[977:07] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[977:09] You know, you're the status quo.
[977:11] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[977:15] You know, things as simple as,
[977:17] like, like, you know, have we got,
[977:20] like, technical
[977:21] leads that actually lead?
[977:23] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[977:28] Have we got any IT ?
[977:30] Have we got
[977:32] anything?
[977:33] And it's like, no.
[977:35] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[977:39] And
[977:40] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[978:06] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[978:09] That was seen as a good thing,
[978:12] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[978:17] Right?
[978:18] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[978:23] Yeah.
[978:25] You know,
[978:27] I I
[978:28] alright.
[978:31] Okay.
[978:32] That's a it's a good strong point.
[978:35] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[978:39] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[978:44] but it was kind of similar.

[983:02] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[983:11] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[983:18] get people to fight over it,
[983:21] but
[983:22] it it probably overcorrected,
[983:25] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[983:30] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[983:34] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[983:39] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[983:43] that was the whole world.
[983:45] Right?
[983:46] You know, that was everything,
[983:49] right, was several months
[983:54] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[984:00] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[984:05] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[984:06] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[984:08] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[984:12] sorry, 2013.
[984:17] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[984:22] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[984:27] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[984:32] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[984:37] going on.
[984:39] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[984:44] so just three further days.
[984:48] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[984:53] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[985:01] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[985:06] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[985:11] So,
[985:12] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[985:19] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[985:22] Oh,
[985:23] sorry.
[985:24] You
[985:25] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[985:31] Right?
[985:32] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[985:37] you had,
[985:38] you know, money for early contributors,
[985:43] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[985:46] Yeah.
[985:47] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[985:52] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[985:58] But
[985:59] then, yeah,
[986:01] following that,
[986:06] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[986:09] onto those teams.
[986:11] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[986:17] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[986:23] you know, that that never got funded.
[986:26] And then you
[986:28] and then you guys starting
[986:30] whenever you were starting.
[986:32] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[986:37] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[986:43] you know, when when that team spun out
[986:47] and you basically did have a major,
[986:50] you know,
[986:51] rapidly load-bearing client,
[986:53] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[986:57] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[987:02] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[987:07] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[987:12] And then it's like, right.
[987:15] Sorry.
[987:16] You're out,
[987:18] and you're not getting any money.
[987:21] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[987:24] Yes.
[987:25] Do you
[987:27] so my memory
[987:29] around the C++ client was that
[987:31] there were funds to
[987:33] do a security audit
[987:35] for
[987:36] two clients,
[987:37] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[987:42] Right?
[987:44] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[987:49] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[987:55] but I'm not quite sure.
[987:58] I'm not they sure did.
[988:01] You know?
[988:02] You know mean?
[988:05] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[988:08] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[988:12] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[988:17] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[988:23] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[988:30] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[988:37] mid 2015,
[988:38] it's like,
[988:40] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[988:45] And then
[988:46] that's what happened.
[988:47] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[988:50] I mean,
[988:51] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[989:06] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[989:12] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[989:15] But the Go client was more stable.
[989:18] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[989:23] it was often in an unstable situation.
[989:26] So even when C++ Ethereum
[989:30] as a client,
[989:31] like, died,
[989:34] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[989:40] It's like, right.
[989:42] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[989:48] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[989:55] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[989:60] across solc,
[989:62] the tests,
[989:63] and C++ Ethereum.
[989:65] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[990:06] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[990:12] but
[990:13] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[990:17] Right?
[990:18] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[990:22] He was he was building that client.
[990:25] He was writing the yellow paper.
[990:28] He was,
[990:30] you know, working there with Christian and
[990:33] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[990:37] You know, all of that was was there.
[990:42] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[990:46] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[990:50] Right?
[990:51] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[990:54] And and that that Geth team were working
[990:57] closer with Mist,
[990:60] you know, with on Mist.
[990:63] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[990:69] You know, it's like Yeah.
[990:71] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[990:74] But but, yeah,
[990:76] that would make sense.
[990:78] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[990:81] And and
[990:82] wait.
[990:84] So see the Solidity compiler.
[990:87] That was part of that C++ group too?
[990:90] Yeah.
[990:91] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[990:95] But yeah.
[990:96] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[991:01] Okay.
[991:02] I remember web three umbrella.
[991:04] I remember the web three umbrella.
[991:06] Yes.
[991:07] So, yeah,
[991:09] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[991:14] you know, for for f.
[991:16] It was called f.
[991:18] It was just called f the executable.
[991:25] So you'd have f and again,
[991:27] yeah, you had f.
[991:29] You had solc.
[991:31] You had
[991:32] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[991:36] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[991:38] Acute client.
[991:40] You had,
[991:41] which was the gooey miner.
[991:44] Yeah.
[991:45] That's right.
[991:46] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[991:53] And then you had one,
[991:55] which was sort of
[991:56] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[992:02] I can't remember the exact scope,
[992:04] but but it was sort of like, right.
[992:07] You're running a node,
[992:10] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[992:13] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[992:30] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[992:37] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[992:39] That's a lot.
[992:41] That that was a lot.
[992:43] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[992:50] Right?
[992:52] Right.
[992:53] Right.
[992:54] Right.
[992:55] But then they were all really codependent.
[992:58] I mean, when I started,
[993:00] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[993:06] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[993:10] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[993:13] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[993:16] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[993:19] Yeah.
[993:21] Dev p two p.
[993:22] Live p two p.
[993:23] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[993:28] documentation all over the place.
[993:30] I mean You know?
[993:32] I think, you know,
[993:36] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[994:05] it's like, right.
[994:08] Let's try and make this modular.
[994:12] Right?
[994:13] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[994:19] But it was it was pulled apart
[994:24] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[994:31] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[994:35] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[994:39] There was no
[994:40] interplace discipline on any of it.
[994:44] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[994:48] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[995:04] So it's like, right.
[995:06] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[995:13] like, that wasn't atomic.
[995:15] It was it was just a big old mess.
[995:22] So yeah,
[995:23] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[995:30] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[995:34] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[995:39] and specifically
[995:41] decoupling
[995:42] and the tests from the client.
[995:46] Right?
[995:47] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[995:54] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[996:00] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[996:05] compiling QT,
[996:09] all of this stuff.
[996:11] So just to get you know?
[996:14] And and there weren't binaries available
[996:19] for Solsea either.
[996:22] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[996:28] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[996:30] You have to do all of that.
[996:32] So I remember,
[996:35] you know, after all that decomposition,
[996:39] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[996:42] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[996:46] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[997:03] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[997:05] This is not great.
[997:07] It was my benefit.
[997:10] It's amazing.
[997:12] But, yeah,
[997:13] it was,
[997:15] yeah,
[997:16] it was a bit of a mess.
[997:18] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[997:21] you know, many times trying to build things,
[997:24] coming back,
[997:25] looking at it,
[997:27] saying, like, this can't be
[997:31] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[997:36] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[998:03] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[998:10] you know, but you're right.
[998:12] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[998:17] You know, talking about that,
[998:19] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[998:24] and everything.
[998:26] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[998:31] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[998:34] because that seems,
[998:36] you know, in an organized way.
[998:39] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[998:41] You know, you're the status quo.
[998:43] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[998:47] You know, things as simple as,
[998:49] like, like, you know, have we got,
[998:52] like, technical
[998:53] leads that actually lead?
[998:55] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[999:00] Have we got any IT ?
[999:02] Have we got
[999:04] anything?
[999:05] And it's like, no.
[999:07] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[999:11] And
[999:12] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[999:18] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[999:21] That was seen as a good thing,
[999:24] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[999:29] Right?
[999:30] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1000:05] Yeah.
[1000:07] You know,
[1000:09] I I
[1000:10] alright.
[1000:13] Okay.
[1000:14] That's a it's a good strong point.
[1000:17] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[1000:21] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[1000:26] but it was kind of similar.
[1000:29] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[1000:34] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[1000:39] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[1000:44] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[1000:51] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[1000:58] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[1001:03] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[1001:09] And but it's, I think,
[1001:12] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[1001:17] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[1001:24] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1001:30] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[1001:35] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[1001:38] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[1001:42] Yeah.
[1001:43] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[1001:46] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[1001:51] I was finding these the other day.
[1001:54] I was finding the first commits
[1001:57] for PyEthereum,
[1002:00] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[1002:07] and Go Ethereum.
[1002:10] And they were all
[1002:11] I think they were all November or December.
[1002:15] I think they were all 2013,
[1002:18] not even 2014 for those three.
[1002:22] Yeah.
[1002:23] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[1002:28] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1002:31] But, you know, that was
[1002:33] Yeah.
[1002:34] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1002:39] Right?
[1002:40] Yeah.
[1002:41] We were much later.
[1002:44] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1002:48] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[1002:50] Yeah.
[1002:51] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1002:54] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[1002:58] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[1003:02] I got to know the project pretty well.
[1003:05] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[1003:10] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[1003:14] September, October, something like that,
[1003:19] and we started work more or less right away.
[1003:23] More Jim than me.
[1003:25] But so yeah,
[1003:27] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[1003:30] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[1003:33] Yep.
[1003:36] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[1003:39] Right?
[1003:40] I think probably
[1003:42] they could have
[1003:43] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[1004:10] doing any hedging.
[1004:13] And then later,
[1004:16] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[1004:22] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[1004:27] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[1004:34] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[1004:39] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[1004:44] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[1005:03] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[1005:10] get people to fight over it,
[1005:13] but
[1005:14] it it probably overcorrected,
[1005:17] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1005:22] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[1005:26] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[1005:31] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[1005:35] that was the whole world.
[1005:37] Right?
[1005:38] You know, that was everything,
[1005:41] right, was several months
[1005:46] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[1005:52] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1006:03] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1006:04] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[1006:06] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[1006:10] sorry, 2013.
[1006:15] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[1006:20] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[1006:25] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[1006:30] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[1006:35] going on.
[1006:37] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[1006:42] so just three further days.
[1006:46] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[1006:51] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[1007:00] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[1007:05] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[1007:10] So,
[1007:11] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[1007:18] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[1007:21] Oh,
[1007:22] sorry.
[1007:23] You
[1007:24] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[1007:30] Right?
[1007:31] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[1007:36] you had,
[1007:37] you know, money for early contributors,
[1007:42] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[1007:45] Yeah.
[1007:46] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[1007:51] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[1007:57] But
[1007:58] then, yeah,
[1008:00] following that,
[1008:05] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[1008:08] onto those teams.
[1008:10] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[1008:16] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[1008:22] you know, that that never got funded.
[1008:25] And then you
[1008:27] and then you guys starting
[1008:29] whenever you were starting.
[1008:31] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[1008:36] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[1008:42] you know, when when that team spun out
[1008:46] and you basically did have a major,
[1008:48] you know,
[1008:49] rapidly load-bearing client,
[1008:51] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[1008:55] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[1009:00] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[1009:05] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[1009:10] And then it's like, right.
[1009:13] Sorry.
[1009:14] You're out,
[1009:16] and you're not getting any money.
[1009:19] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1009:22] Yes.
[1009:23] Do you
[1009:25] so my memory
[1009:27] around the C++ client was that
[1009:29] there were funds to
[1009:31] do a security audit
[1009:33] for
[1009:34] two clients,
[1009:35] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[1009:40] Right?
[1009:42] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[1009:47] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[1009:53] but I'm not quite sure.
[1009:56] I'm not they sure did.
[1009:59] You know?
[1010:00] You know mean?
[1010:03] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1010:06] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[1010:10] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[1010:15] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[1010:21] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[1010:28] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[1010:35] mid 2015,
[1010:36] it's like,
[1010:38] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[1010:43] And then
[1010:44] that's what happened.
[1010:45] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1010:48] I mean,
[1010:49] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[1010:56] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[1011:02] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[1011:05] But the Go client was more stable.
[1011:08] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[1011:13] it was often in an unstable situation.
[1011:16] So even when C++ Ethereum
[1011:20] as a client,
[1011:21] like, died,
[1011:24] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[1011:30] It's like, right.
[1011:32] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[1011:38] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[1011:45] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[1011:50] across solc,
[1011:52] the tests,
[1011:53] and C++ Ethereum.
[1011:55] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[1012:06] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[1012:12] but
[1012:13] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[1012:17] Right?
[1012:18] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[1012:22] He was he was building that client.
[1012:25] He was writing the yellow paper.
[1012:28] He was,
[1012:30] you know, working there with Christian and
[1012:33] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[1012:37] You know, all of that was was there.
[1012:42] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[1012:46] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[1012:50] Right?
[1012:51] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[1012:54] And and that that Geth team were working
[1012:57] closer with Mist,
[1013:00] you know, with on Mist.
[1013:03] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[1013:09] You know, it's like Yeah.
[1013:11] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[1013:14] But but, yeah,
[1013:16] that would make sense.
[1013:18] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1013:21] And and
[1013:22] wait.
[1013:24] So see the Solidity compiler.
[1013:27] That was part of that C++ group too?
[1013:30] Yeah.
[1013:31] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[1013:35] But yeah.
[1013:36] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1013:41] Okay.
[1013:42] I remember web three umbrella.
[1013:44] I remember the web three umbrella.
[1013:46] Yes.
[1013:47] So, yeah,
[1013:49] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[1013:54] you know, for for f.
[1013:56] It was called f.
[1013:58] It was just called f the executable.
[1014:05] So you'd have f and again,
[1014:07] yeah, you had f.
[1014:09] You had solc.
[1014:11] You had
[1014:12] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1014:17] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1014:19] Acute client.
[1014:21] You had,
[1014:22] which was the gooey miner.
[1014:25] Yeah.
[1014:26] That's right.
[1014:27] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[1014:34] And then you had one,
[1014:36] which was sort of
[1014:37] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[1014:43] I can't remember the exact scope,
[1014:45] but but it was sort of like, right.
[1014:48] You're running a node,
[1014:51] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[1014:54] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[1015:11] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[1015:18] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[1015:20] That's a lot.
[1015:22] That that was a lot.
[1015:24] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[1015:31] Right?
[1015:33] Right.
[1015:34] Right.
[1015:35] Right.
[1015:36] But then they were all really codependent.
[1015:39] I mean, when I started,
[1015:41] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[1015:47] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[1016:02] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[1016:05] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[1016:08] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1016:11] Yeah.
[1016:13] Dev p two p.
[1016:14] Live p two p.
[1016:15] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1016:20] documentation all over the place.
[1016:22] I mean You know?
[1016:24] I think, you know,
[1016:28] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[1017:37] it's like, right.
[1017:40] Let's try and make this modular.
[1017:44] Right?
[1017:45] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[1017:51] But it was it was pulled apart
[1017:56] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[1018:03] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[1018:07] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[1018:11] There was no
[1018:12] interplace discipline on any of it.
[1018:16] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[1018:20] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[1018:36] So it's like, right.
[1018:38] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[1018:45] like, that wasn't atomic.
[1018:47] It was it was just a big old mess.
[1019:04] So yeah,
[1019:05] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[1019:12] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[1019:16] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[1019:21] and specifically
[1019:23] decoupling
[1019:24] and the tests from the client.
[1019:28] Right?
[1019:29] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[1019:36] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[1019:42] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[1019:47] compiling QT,
[1019:51] all of this stuff.
[1019:53] So just to get you know?
[1019:56] And and there weren't binaries available
[1020:01] for Solsea either.
[1020:04] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[1020:10] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[1020:12] You have to do all of that.
[1020:14] So I remember,
[1020:17] you know, after all that decomposition,
[1020:21] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[1020:24] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[1020:28] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[1020:45] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[1020:47] This is not great.
[1020:49] It was my benefit.
[1020:52] It's amazing.
[1020:54] But, yeah,
[1020:56] it was,
[1020:58] yeah,
[1020:59] it was a bit of a mess.
[1021:01] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1021:06] you know, many times trying to build things,
[1021:09] coming back,
[1021:10] looking at it,
[1021:12] saying, like, this can't be
[1021:16] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[1021:21] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[1022:08] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[1022:15] you know, but you're right.
[1022:17] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1022:22] You know, talking about that,
[1022:24] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[1022:29] and everything.
[1022:31] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[1022:36] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[1022:39] because that seems,
[1022:41] you know, in an organized way.
[1022:44] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[1022:46] You know, you're the status quo.
[1022:48] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[1022:52] You know, things as simple as,
[1022:54] like, like, you know, have we got,
[1022:57] like, technical
[1022:58] leads that actually lead?
[1023:00] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[1023:05] Have we got any IT ?
[1023:07] Have we got
[1023:09] anything?
[1023:10] And it's like, no.
[1023:12] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[1023:16] And
[1023:17] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[1024:03] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[1024:06] That was seen as a good thing,
[1024:09] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[1024:14] Right?
[1024:15] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1024:30] Yeah.
[1024:32] You know,
[1024:34] I I
[1024:35] alright.
[1024:38] Okay.
[1024:39] That's a it's a good strong point.
[1024:42] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[1024:46] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[1024:51] but it was kind of similar.
[1024:54] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[1024:59] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[1025:04] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[1025:09] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[1025:16] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[1025:23] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[1025:28] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[1025:34] And but it's, I think,
[1025:37] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[1025:42] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[1026:01] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1026:07] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[1026:12] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[1026:15] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[1026:19] Yeah.
[1026:20] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[1026:23] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[1026:28] I was finding these the other day.
[1026:31] I was finding the first commits
[1026:34] for PyEthereum,
[1026:36] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[1026:43] and Go Ethereum.
[1026:46] And they were all
[1026:47] I think they were all November or December.
[1026:51] I think they were all 2013,
[1026:54] not even 2014 for those three.
[1027:00] Yeah.
[1027:01] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[1027:06] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1027:09] But, you know, that was
[1027:11] Yeah.
[1027:12] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1027:17] Right?
[1027:18] Yeah.
[1027:19] We were much later.
[1027:22] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1027:26] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[1027:28] Yeah.
[1027:29] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1027:32] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[1027:36] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[1027:40] I got to know the project pretty well.
[1027:43] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[1027:48] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[1027:52] September, October, something like that,
[1027:57] and we started work more or less right away.
[1028:01] More Jim than me.
[1028:03] But so yeah,
[1028:05] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[1028:08] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[1028:11] Yep.
[1028:14] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[1028:17] Right?
[1028:18] I think probably
[1028:20] they could have
[1028:21] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[1028:38] doing any hedging.
[1028:41] And then later,
[1028:44] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[1028:50] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[1028:55] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[1029:02] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[1029:07] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[1029:12] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[1030:06] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[1030:13] get people to fight over it,
[1030:16] but
[1030:17] it it probably overcorrected,
[1030:20] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1030:25] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[1030:29] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[1030:34] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[1030:38] that was the whole world.
[1030:40] Right?
[1030:41] You know, that was everything,
[1030:44] right, was several months
[1030:49] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[1030:55] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1031:06] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1031:07] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[1031:09] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[1031:13] sorry, 2013.
[1031:18] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[1031:23] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[1031:28] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[1031:33] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[1031:38] going on.
[1031:40] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[1031:45] so just three further days.
[1031:49] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[1031:54] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[1032:03] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[1032:08] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[1032:13] So,
[1032:14] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[1032:21] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[1032:24] Oh,
[1032:25] sorry.
[1032:26] You
[1032:27] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[1032:33] Right?
[1032:34] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[1032:39] you had,
[1032:40] you know, money for early contributors,
[1032:45] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[1032:48] Yeah.
[1032:49] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[1032:54] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[1033:00] But
[1033:01] then, yeah,
[1033:03] following that,
[1033:08] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[1033:11] onto those teams.
[1033:13] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[1033:19] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[1033:25] you know, that that never got funded.
[1033:28] And then you
[1033:30] and then you guys starting
[1033:32] whenever you were starting.
[1033:34] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[1033:39] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[1033:45] you know, when when that team spun out
[1033:49] and you basically did have a major,
[1033:51] you know,
[1033:52] rapidly load-bearing client,
[1033:54] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[1033:58] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[1034:03] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[1034:08] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[1034:13] And then it's like, right.
[1034:16] Sorry.
[1034:17] You're out,
[1034:19] and you're not getting any money.
[1034:22] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1034:25] Yes.
[1034:26] Do you
[1034:28] so my memory
[1034:30] around the C++ client was that
[1034:32] there were funds to
[1034:34] do a security audit
[1034:36] for
[1034:37] two clients,
[1034:38] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[1034:43] Right?
[1034:45] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[1034:50] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[1034:56] but I'm not quite sure.
[1034:59] I'm not they sure did.
[1035:02] You know?
[1035:03] You know mean?
[1035:06] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1035:09] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[1035:13] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[1035:18] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[1035:24] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[1035:31] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[1035:38] mid 2015,
[1035:39] it's like,
[1035:41] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[1035:46] And then
[1035:47] that's what happened.
[1035:48] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1035:51] I mean,
[1035:52] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[1036:07] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[1036:13] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[1036:16] But the Go client was more stable.
[1036:19] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[1036:24] it was often in an unstable situation.
[1036:27] So even when C++ Ethereum
[1036:31] as a client,
[1036:32] like, died,
[1036:35] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[1036:41] It's like, right.
[1036:43] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[1036:49] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[1037:00] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[1037:05] across solc,
[1037:07] the tests,
[1037:08] and C++ Ethereum.
[1037:10] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[1037:21] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[1037:27] but
[1037:28] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[1037:32] Right?
[1037:33] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[1037:37] He was he was building that client.
[1037:40] He was writing the yellow paper.
[1037:43] He was,
[1037:45] you know, working there with Christian and
[1037:48] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[1037:52] You know, all of that was was there.
[1038:00] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[1038:04] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[1038:07] Right?
[1038:08] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[1038:11] And and that that Geth team were working
[1038:14] closer with Mist,
[1038:17] you know, with on Mist.
[1038:20] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[1038:26] You know, it's like Yeah.
[1038:28] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[1038:31] But but, yeah,
[1038:33] that would make sense.
[1038:35] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1038:40] And and
[1038:41] wait.
[1038:43] So see the Solidity compiler.
[1038:46] That was part of that C++ group too?
[1038:49] Yeah.
[1038:50] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[1038:54] But yeah.
[1038:55] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1039:00] Okay.
[1039:01] I remember web three umbrella.
[1039:03] I remember the web three umbrella.
[1039:05] Yes.
[1039:06] So, yeah,
[1039:08] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[1039:13] you know, for for f.
[1039:15] It was called f.
[1039:17] It was just called f the executable.
[1039:24] So you'd have f and again,
[1039:26] yeah, you had f.
[1039:28] You had solc.
[1039:30] You had
[1039:31] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1039:36] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1039:38] Acute client.
[1039:40] You had,
[1039:41] which was the gooey miner.
[1039:44] Yeah.
[1039:45] That's right.
[1039:46] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[1039:53] And then you had one,
[1039:55] which was sort of
[1039:56] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[1040:02] I can't remember the exact scope,
[1040:04] but but it was sort of like, right.
[1040:07] You're running a node,
[1040:10] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[1040:13] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[1040:29] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[1040:36] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[1040:38] That's a lot.
[1040:40] That that was a lot.
[1040:42] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[1040:50] Right?
[1040:52] Right.
[1040:53] Right.
[1040:54] Right.
[1040:55] But then they were all really codependent.
[1040:58] I mean, when I started,
[1041:00] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[1041:06] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[1042:01] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[1042:04] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[1042:07] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1042:10] Yeah.
[1042:12] Dev p two p.
[1042:13] Live p two p.
[1042:14] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1042:19] documentation all over the place.
[1042:21] I mean You know?
[1042:23] I think, you know,
[1042:27] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[1043:36] it's like, right.
[1043:39] Let's try and make this modular.
[1043:43] Right?
[1043:44] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[1043:50] But it was it was pulled apart
[1043:55] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[1044:02] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[1044:06] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[1044:10] There was no
[1044:11] interplace discipline on any of it.
[1044:15] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[1044:19] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[1045:35] So it's like, right.
[1045:37] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[1046:02] like, that wasn't atomic.
[1046:04] It was it was just a big old mess.
[1046:11] So yeah,
[1046:12] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[1046:20] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[1046:24] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[1046:29] and specifically
[1046:31] decoupling
[1046:32] and the tests from the client.
[1046:36] Right?
[1046:37] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[1046:44] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[1046:50] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[1046:55] compiling QT,
[1047:00] all of this stuff.
[1047:02] So just to get you know?
[1047:05] And and there weren't binaries available
[1047:10] for Solsea either.
[1047:13] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[1047:19] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[1047:21] You have to do all of that.
[1047:23] So I remember,
[1047:26] you know, after all that decomposition,
[1047:30] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[1047:33] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[1047:37] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[1048:04] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[1048:06] This is not great.
[1048:08] It was my benefit.
[1048:11] It's amazing.
[1048:13] But, yeah,
[1048:15] it was,
[1048:17] yeah,
[1048:18] it was a bit of a mess.
[1048:20] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1048:25] you know, many times trying to build things,
[1048:28] coming back,
[1048:29] looking at it,
[1048:31] saying, like, this can't be
[1048:35] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[1048:40] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[1049:07] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[1049:14] you know, but you're right.
[1049:16] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1049:21] You know, talking about that,
[1049:23] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[1049:28] and everything.
[1049:30] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[1049:35] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[1049:38] because that seems,
[1049:40] you know, in an organized way.
[1049:43] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[1049:45] You know, you're the status quo.
[1049:47] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[1049:51] You know, things as simple as,
[1049:53] like, like, you know, have we got,
[1049:56] like, technical
[1049:57] leads that actually lead?
[1049:59] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[1050:04] Have we got any IT ?
[1050:06] Have we got
[1050:08] anything?
[1050:09] And it's like, no.
[1050:11] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[1050:15] And
[1050:16] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[1051:02] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[1051:05] That was seen as a good thing,
[1051:08] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[1051:13] Right?
[1051:14] You know, we don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1052:09] Yeah.
[1052:11] You know,
[1052:13] I I
[1052:14] alright.
[1052:17] Okay.
[1052:18] That's a it's a good strong point.
[1052:21] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[1052:25] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[1052:30] but it was kind of similar.
[1052:33] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[1052:38] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[1052:43] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[1052:48] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[1052:55] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[1053:02] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[1053:07] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[1053:13] And but it's, I think,
[1053:16] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[1053:21] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[1053:30] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1053:36] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[1053:41] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[1053:44] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[1053:48] Yeah.
[1053:49] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[1053:52] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[1053:57] I was finding these the other day.
[1054:00] I was finding the first commits
[1054:03] for PyEthereum,
[1054:06] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[1054:13] and Go Ethereum.
[1054:16] And they were all
[1054:17] I think they were all November or December.
[1054:21] I think they were all 2013,
[1054:24] not even 2014 for those three.
[1054:28] Yeah.
[1054:29] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[1054:34] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1054:37] But, you know, that was
[1054:39] Yeah.
[1054:40] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1054:45] Right?
[1054:46] Yeah.
[1054:47] We were much later.
[1054:50] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1054:54] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[1054:56] Yeah.
[1054:57] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1055:00] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[1055:04] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[1055:08] I got to know the project pretty well.
[1055:11] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[1055:16] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[1055:20] September, October, something like that,
[1055:25] and we started work more or less right away.
[1055:29] More Jim than me.
[1055:31] But so yeah,
[1055:33] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[1055:36] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[1055:39] Yep.
[1055:42] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[1055:45] Right?
[1055:46] I think probably
[1055:48] they could have
[1055:49] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[1056:16] doing any hedging.
[1056:19] And then later,
[1056:22] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[1056:27] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[1056:32] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[1056:39] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[1056:44] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[1056:49] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[1057:38] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[1057:45] get people to fight over it,
[1057:48] but
[1057:49] it it probably overcorrected,
[1057:52] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1058:03] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[1058:07] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[1058:12] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[1058:16] that was the whole world.
[1058:18] Right?
[1058:19] You know, that was everything,
[1058:22] right, was several months
[1058:27] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[1058:33] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1059:04] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1059:05] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[1059:07] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[1059:11] sorry, 2013.
[1059:16] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[1059:21] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[1059:26] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[1059:31] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[1059:36] going on.
[1059:38] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[1059:43] so just three further days.
[1059:47] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[1059:52] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[1060:01] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[1060:06] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[1060:11] So,
[1060:12] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[1060:19] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[1060:22] Oh,
[1060:23] sorry.
[1060:24] You
[1060:25] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[1060:31] Right?
[1060:32] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[1060:37] you had,
[1060:38] you know, money for early contributors,
[1060:43] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[1060:46] Yeah.
[1060:47] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[1060:52] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[1060:58] But
[1060:59] then, yeah,
[1061:01] following that,
[1061:06] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[1061:09] onto those teams.
[1061:11] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[1061:17] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[1061:23] you know, that that never got funded.
[1061:26] And then you
[1061:28] and then you guys starting
[1061:30] whenever you were starting.
[1061:32] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[1061:37] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[1061:43] you know, when when that team spun out
[1061:47] and you basically did have a major,
[1061:49] you know,
[1061:50] rapidly load-bearing client,
[1061:52] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[1061:56] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[1062:01] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[1062:06] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[1062:11] And then it's like, right.
[1062:14] Sorry.
[1062:15] You're out,
[1062:17] and you're not getting any money.
[1062:20] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1062:23] Yes.
[1062:24] Do you
[1062:26] so my memory
[1062:28] around the C++ client was that
[1062:30] there were funds to
[1062:32] do a security audit
[1062:34] for
[1062:35] two clients,
[1062:36] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[1062:41] Right?
[1062:43] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[1062:48] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[1062:54] but I'm not quite sure.
[1062:57] I'm not they sure did.
[1063:00] You know?
[1063:01] You know mean?
[1063:04] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1063:07] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[1063:11] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[1063:16] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[1063:22] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[1063:29] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[1063:36] mid 2015,
[1063:37] it's like,
[1063:40] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[1063:45] And then
[1063:46] that's what happened.
[1063:47] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1063:50] I mean,
[1063:51] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[1064:06] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[1064:12] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[1064:15] But the Go client was more stable.
[1064:18] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[1064:23] it was often in an unstable situation.
[1064:26] So even when C++ Ethereum
[1064:30] as a client,
[1064:31] like, died,
[1064:34] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[1064:40] It's like, right.
[1064:42] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[1064:48] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from.
[1065:09] So, yeah, that frontline was really, like, leading
[1065:14] across solc,
[1065:16] the tests,
[1065:17] and C++ Ethereum.
[1065:19] You know, all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps, like with mix and Alice zero, five.
[1065:30] Like, it took twenty four hours to build the bloody thing,
[1065:36] but
[1065:37] that will be because it was all around Gav.
[1065:41] Right?
[1065:42] You know, Gav was leading all of that.
[1065:46] He was he was building that client.
[1065:49] He was writing the yellow paper.
[1065:52] He was,
[1065:54] you know, working there with Christian and
[1065:57] Christophe on that specification and testing stuff like that.
[1066:01] You know, all of that was was there.
[1066:06] And then on Geth on Jeff's side,
[1066:09] you know, it's but, you know, just doing Geth.
[1066:12] Right?
[1066:13] It wasn't wasn't a broader thing.
[1066:16] And and that that Geth team were working
[1066:19] closer with Mist,
[1066:22] you know, with on Mist.
[1066:25] Like, for a good while, I don't think C++ Ethereum even worked with Mist.
[1066:31] You know, it's like Yeah.
[1066:33] All these groups not really talking to each other.
[1066:36] But but, yeah,
[1066:38] that would make sense.
[1066:40] Like, a lot of it was Gav led.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1066:45] And and
[1066:46] wait.
[1066:48] So see the Solidity compiler.
[1066:51] That was part of that C++ group too?
[1066:54] Yeah.
[1066:55] That makes sense because it it was written in C++.
[1066:59] But yeah.
[1067:00] It was all under web three umbrella.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1067:05] Okay.
[1067:06] I remember web three umbrella.
[1067:08] I remember the web three umbrella.
[1067:10] Yes.
[1067:11] So, yeah,
[1067:13] web three umbrella was a Git repo with sub repos for
[1067:18] you know, for for f.
[1067:20] It was called f.
[1067:22] It was just called f the executable.
[1067:29] So you'd have f and again,
[1067:31] yeah, you had f.
[1067:33] You had solc.
[1067:35] You had
[1067:36] mix, which was the original IDE.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1067:41] Yes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1067:43] Acute client.
[1067:45] You had,
[1067:46] which was the gooey miner.
[1067:49] Yeah.
[1067:50] That's right.
[1067:51] So it's like, here, here's a good press the mine button and you know?
[1068:02] And then you had one,
[1068:04] which was sort of
[1068:05] I guess it was, like, kind of like a gooey client runner thing.
[1068:11] I can't remember the exact scope,
[1068:13] but but it was sort of like, right.
[1068:16] You're running a node,
[1068:19] but you've kind of got a gooey on it.
[1068:22] And I I can't remember what it had, but, you know, whatever logs going by,
[1068:39] and I guess you could, like, fiddle with settings or whatever.
[1068:46] But, yeah, all of that was in web three umbrella.
[1068:48] That's a lot.
[1068:50] That that was a lot.
[1068:52] And all of the depend they were all really code oh, test and the test as well.
[1069:00] Right?
[1069:02] Right.
[1069:03] Right.
[1069:04] Right.
[1069:05] But then they were all really codependent.
[1069:08] I mean, when I started,
[1069:10] one of the first things I did was like what are the dependencies on all of these?
[1069:16] And it's like, what is all of this stuff?
[1070:21] Because you had, like, libraries with it as well.
[1070:24] It's like Lib Ethereum,
[1070:27] Lib web three base.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1070:30] Yeah.
[1070:32] Dev p two p.
[1070:33] Live p two p.
[1070:34] There were certain

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1070:39] documentation all over the place.
[1070:41] I mean You know?
[1070:43] I think, you know,
[1070:47] I think what had happened there that Gab was sort of trying to do, but it never came to fruition and then he left, was
[1071:56] it's like, right.
[1072:00] Let's try and make this modular.
[1072:04] Right?
[1072:05] We're we're gonna try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this and the other.
[1072:11] But it was it was pulled apart
[1072:16] into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these.
[1072:23] So you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway.
[1072:27] Like, you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning.
[1072:31] There was no
[1072:32] interplace discipline on any of it.
[1072:36] You had to use all the latest ones together,
[1072:40] but then it was all split into separate repos.
[1073:56] So it's like, right.
[1073:58] You're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the sub modules and, like
[1074:05] like, that wasn't atomic.
[1074:07] It was it was just a big old mess.
[1074:24] So yeah,
[1074:25] one of the first things I did was, like, you know, work out infer infer a dependency diagram,
[1074:32] map a path to pulling it all back into a monolithic workspace,
[1074:36] doing, like, automated builds that we somehow didn't have,
[1074:41] and specifically
[1074:43] decoupling
[1074:44] and the tests from the client.
[1074:48] Right?
[1074:49] So for example, because it was tied in with this full workspace,
[1075:06] it was literally a twenty four hour build.
[1075:12] It was like compiling Chromium from source twice,
[1075:17] compiling QT,
[1075:21] all of this stuff.
[1075:23] So just to get you know?
[1075:26] And and there weren't binaries available
[1075:31] for Solsea either.
[1075:34] Like, you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to, like, compile,
[1075:39] you know, a smart contract to do anything.
[1075:41] You have to do all of that.
[1075:43] So I remember,
[1075:46] you know, after all that decomposition,
[1075:50] I, you know, I got it so you could just do.
[1075:53] And then I did, like, homebrew,
[1075:57] and it's like so you could do, like, brew install salsa, and they did it in, like, five seconds.
[1076:14] And everyone's like, oh my god.
[1076:16] This is not great.
[1076:18] It was my benefit.
[1076:21] It's amazing.
[1076:23] But, yeah,
[1076:25] it was,
[1076:27] yeah,
[1076:28] it was a bit of a mess.
[1076:30] I do remember waiting, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1076:35] you know, many times trying to build things,
[1076:38] coming back,
[1076:39] looking at it,
[1076:41] saying, like, this can't be
[1076:45] my machine's gotta be broken because, like, it can't be this long.
[1076:50] Can't be, like, eight hours.
[1077:28] Like, nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do,
[1077:35] you know, but you're right.
[1077:37] It's just like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1077:42] You know, talking about that,
[1077:44] you know, creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated
[1077:49] and everything.
[1077:51] One of my first observations on joining the the foundation is
[1078:06] these people seem allergic to professionalism
[1078:09] because that seems,
[1078:11] you know, in an organized way.
[1078:14] Well, you're one of the baddies.
[1078:16] You know, you're the status quo.
[1078:18] You're trying to subvert and take it over.
[1078:22] You know, things as simple as,
[1078:24] like, like, you know, have we got,
[1078:27] like, technical
[1078:28] leads that actually lead?
[1078:30] You know, have have we got any project management ?
[1078:35] Have we got any IT ?
[1078:37] Have we got
[1078:39] anything?
[1078:40] And it's like, no.
[1078:42] It's just like a jumble of people doing stuff.
[1078:46] And
[1078:47] it's like, oh, how how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment?
[1079:33] But that was kind of the vibe as well.
[1079:36] That was seen as a good thing,
[1079:39] you know, because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing.
[1080:04] Yeah.
[1080:06] You know,
[1080:08] I I
[1080:09] alright.
[1080:12] Okay.
[1080:13] That's a it's a good strong point.
[1080:16] So if you compare it to like, a Bitcoin,
[1080:20] which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin,
[1080:25] but it was kind of similar.
[1080:28] There was less of a premine and no token presale.
[1080:33] And so the people who are in it were in it for general interest,
[1080:38] and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[1080:43] And I I would argue, you know, in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin,
[1080:50] especially since, you know, let's say 02/2015.
[1080:57] Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes,
[1081:02] and it's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[1081:08] And but it's, I think,
[1081:11] you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[1081:16] I I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes
[1081:23] in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1081:29] Another major difference there talking about clients is
[1081:34] it was a very deliberate decision, right,
[1081:37] on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[1081:41] Yeah.
[1081:42] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[1081:45] I I've see if I can find my Twitter thread.
[1081:50] I was finding these the other day.
[1081:53] I was finding the first commits
[1081:56] for PyEthereum,
[1081:58] PyApp, or PyEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum,
[1082:05] and Go Ethereum.
[1082:08] And they were all
[1082:09] I think they were all November or December.
[1082:13] I think they were all 2013,
[1082:16] not even 2014 for those three.
[1082:22] Yeah.
[1082:23] And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April,
[1082:28] I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1082:31] But, you know, that was
[1082:33] Yeah.
[1082:34] Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1082:39] Right?
[1082:40] Yeah.
[1082:41] We were much later.
[1082:44] We were

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1082:48] When did we get the fourth quarter 2014?
[1082:50] Yeah.
[1082:51] That's Sounds appropriate.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1082:54] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer,
[1082:58] so starting kind of maybe June 2014.
[1083:02] I got to know the project pretty well.
[1083:05] And then I'd I'd gone back to Berkeley.
[1083:10] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim
[1083:14] September, October, something like that,
[1083:19] and we started work more or less right away.
[1083:23] More Jim than me.
[1083:25] But so yeah,
[1083:27] there was a big time delay on on our side.
[1083:30] And and, yeah, I think okay.
[1083:33] Yep.
[1083:36] Bob, it it's an interesting point.
[1083:39] Right?
[1083:40] I think probably
[1083:42] they could have
[1083:43] there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds,
[1084:10] doing any hedging.
[1084:13] And then later,
[1084:16] I I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling,
[1084:21] and that would have alienated fewer people,
[1084:26] and it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[1085:37] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here,
[1085:42] but it it's sort of the idea and the community
[1085:47] was so powerful that it you know, there's definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect.
[1086:36] I think there was value still in this like throw it out there,
[1086:43] get people to fight over it,
[1086:46] but
[1086:47] it it probably overcorrected,
[1086:50] and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1087:01] because it wasn't the big enough time.
[1087:05] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there.
[1087:10] It's like, well, the people that doing it,
[1087:14] that was the whole world.
[1087:16] Right?
[1087:17] You know, that was everything,
[1087:20] right, was several months
[1087:25] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed.
[1087:31] That was actually unfunded.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1088:02] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1088:03] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[1088:05] So the white paper came out in November 2013,
[1088:10] sorry, 2013.
[1088:15] PyEthereum was started on 11/19/2013.
[1088:20] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[1088:25] C++ Ethereum started four days later, December 23rd,
[1088:30] obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things
[1088:35] going on.
[1088:37] And then Go Ethereum was December 26th,
[1088:42] so just three further days.
[1088:46] The foundation got formed, I think, in May or May 2014,
[1088:51] but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[1089:00] So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development
[1089:05] on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[1089:10] So,
[1089:11] you know, make make you know, I think I think that unfairness kinda came in a little bit later.
[1089:17] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[1089:20] Oh,
[1089:21] sorry.
[1089:22] You
[1089:23] know, nobody got funded, though there was the retrospective payback.
[1089:29] Right?
[1089:30] You know, when when the crowdsale had gone through,
[1089:35] you had,
[1089:36] you know, money for early contributors,
[1089:41] which I think I think that was nearly 10%
[1089:44] Yeah.
[1089:45] For, like, a hundred, hundred and twenty people.
[1089:50] Like, some people made out, like, absolute bandits for those early months.
[1089:56] But
[1089:57] then, yeah,
[1090:00] following that,
[1090:05] there was hiring of actual, you know, staff
[1090:08] onto those teams.
[1090:10] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven
[1090:16] because you already had a for a number of months there and that,
[1090:22] you know, that that never got funded.
[1090:25] And then you
[1090:27] and then you guys starting
[1090:29] whenever you were starting.
[1090:31] So, yeah, it it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[1090:36] And and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity,
[1090:42] you know, when when that team spun out
[1090:46] and you basically did have a major,
[1090:48] you know,
[1090:49] rapidly load-bearing client,
[1090:51] and it was just, you know, unfunded,
[1090:55] especially in with Geth who was, you know,
[1091:00] had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client
[1091:05] and, you know, all of the value he delivered.
[1091:10] And then it's like, right.
[1091:13] Sorry.
[1091:14] You're out,
[1091:16] and you're not getting any money.
[1091:19] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1091:22] Yes.
[1091:23] Do you
[1091:25] so my memory
[1091:27] around the C++ client was that
[1091:29] there were funds to
[1091:31] do a security audit
[1091:33] for
[1091:34] two clients,
[1091:35] but one at a time, and it was tight.
[1091:40] Right?
[1091:42] Like And so they did go Ethereum first,
[1091:47] and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum,
[1091:53] but I'm not quite sure.
[1091:56] I'm not they sure did.
[1092:00] You know?
[1092:01] You know mean?
[1092:04] Maybe

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1092:07] maybe there'd been an intention to do that,
[1092:11] but then the money ride ran out before it happened.
[1092:16] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum was, like, working first,
[1092:22] but then Go Ethereum just, like, caught up and overtook it, like, really fast.
[1092:29] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding, which would have been
[1092:36] mid 2015,
[1092:37] it's like,
[1092:40] hey, Gabby, you're the CTO, but it's your co-co pays that's gotta copy it.
[1092:45] And then
[1092:46] that's what happened.
[1092:47] And

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1092:50] I mean,
[1092:51] I was I was sort of building the various clients quite a bit because I was trying to integrate with them at the time.
[1093:06] And my memory was that the C++ client had all the newest stuff in it first.
[1093:12] So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there.
[1093:15] But the Go client was more stable.
[1093:18] Like, because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client,
[1093:23] it was often in an unstable situation.
[1093:26] So even when C++ Ethereum
[1093:30] as a client,
[1093:31] like, died,
[1093:34] it didn't die within that testing suite for years.
[1093:40] It's like, right.
[1093:42] Even though nobody's actually, like, running this or using it on mainnet or anything,
[1093:48] you know, we've gotta keep maintaining that one because that's
