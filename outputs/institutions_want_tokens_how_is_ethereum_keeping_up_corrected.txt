Bobson Wilson:
[2.0s] What are you using?
[2.9s] I use WeStream.
[4.4s] We try to do something, and it's streamed on Twitter.
[7.1s] I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

Victor Wong:
[10.2s] So we're using StreamYard too.
[13.2s] We're using StreamYard, and I'm just double-checking.

James Levin:
[15.3s] We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit—

Bobson Wilson:
[23.9s] No, I'm perfect, yeah.

James Levin:
[25.1s] Yeah.

Bobson Wilson:
[25.9s] I'll share the one.
[27.4s] I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty good.

James Levin:
[30.6s] Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right?
[33.5s] It's such a common need.
[35.4s] Isn't there just an answer that just works?

Bobson Wilson:
[38.8s] But the thing is, those platforms—they're not built with interoperability in mind.
[43.6s] They don't like it.
[44.4s] They want to trap you in.
[46.7s] Yeah, exactly.
[47.9s] That's against our vision.
[49.5s] On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio.
[54.6s] Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it?
[57.5s] You know, like that's something... I guess the next step in maybe like—you want to use it somewhere else?
[62.5s] Are you seeing somebody else?
[64.8s] Be able to own your data—you know, even own a query or just access, you know.
[70.2s] Something I love about Google is like, I can go, I can activate the tracking.
[75.8s] But at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week?
[79.0s] I went in front of that restaurant or that store.
[80.9s] It was pretty nice.
[82.1s] And I can go and see and check.
[83.8s] I have access to that.
[84.6s] It can be helpful.
[85.8s] But most of those things—they have like thousands of data points—but they don't even share it with you.

Victor Wong:
[91.1s] Yeah, exactly.

Bobson Wilson:
[93.5s] I find it quite well.
[98.1s] 501.

James Levin:
[98.6s] Oh, yeah.

Victor Wong:
[99.7s] We are live.
[101.6s] So we're live.
[102.6s] No, no, no, I'm ready.
[104.0s] No, but that was a good, cold intro, right?
[106.5s] So we have a very special guest today, but a special format, because all of us are for Django Live—in real life.

James Levin:
[116.7s] In the same room.
[117.7s] In the same room.
[118.8s] Amazing.

Victor Wong:
[119.6s] And you are a special guest.
[121.6s] Do you want to intro?

James Levin:
[123.4s] Yeah.
[123.8s] Sure.
[124.4s] So yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslem, who is the Executive Director of the EEA—the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance—which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years.
[140.8s] Healthy run.

Bobson Wilson:
[141.8s] Yes, exactly.

James Levin:
[142.9s] That's right.
[143.4s] So yeah.
[144.4s] It's eight years now.
[146.1s] In 2017, yeah.
[147.6s] February 2017 was the launch date, on the 28th.

James Levin:
[150.6s] It was pre-work.
[151.9s] Solidly before. At least three months, maybe more.

James Levin:
[154.4s] There were meetings I was part of in December and January.
[159.8s] I mean, those were the first big meetings, you know, with whatever, 30–40 people—crazy amounts.
[167.8s] But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2, really.
[172.4s] Those were the discussions.
[174.3s] That was Shanghai, October.

James Levin:
[176.8s] There was the kickoff meeting at the JPMorgan office, which was pretty big.
[183.3s] Then there were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

James Levin:
[186.6s] Right.
[187.4s] That public launch was February.
[189.5s] It was February.
[190.5s] But December, there was an internal one, and then JPMorgan—
[196.1s] was in January 2017.
[197.8s] But yeah, like a lot of those initial contacts—that happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

Victor Wong:
[205.4s] Well, in that Devcon 2—oh yes.

James Levin:
[208.0s] Yeah.

Victor Wong:
[208.4s] So like, basically, there were a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too.
[220.3s] And there were a lot of interested parties.
[222.5s] And yeah—
[224.3s] the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at a Starbucks just off-site.
[232.4s] And that was sort of the idea-formation thing about the event.

James Levin:
[238.0s] And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little bar-side event as well, which—we had some technical issues.

Victor Wong:
[254.8s] Oh, OK.
[255.7s] Hold on a second.
[256.7s] I'm just going to push James's to tell her about it on YouTube.

James Levin:
[259.8s] We have a technical issue, everybody.

Victor Wong:
[262.0s] I will fix that.
[265.5s] Oh, did I?
[266.4s] I messed up the Twitter feed.
[267.4s] You did a bad one.
[268.2s] Yeah.
[268.8s] I did a bad one.
[269.8s] So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

James Levin:
[272.7s] Spaces at 5 AM.

James Levin:
[274.4s] Right.

James Levin:
[275.0s] Yes.

James Levin:
[275.8s] But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to. And there were various others there.
[283.2s] I don't know if you went to that as well.

Victor Wong:
[285.4s] I—I didn’t go to that one.
[289.1s] So I think the main thing was that... yeah, so I think the main thing—I’m going to try and fix this right now on Twitter—live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now.

James Levin:
[302.0s] If not, I am.

Victor Wong:
[305.7s] I did choose AI.

James Levin:
[308.2s] But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff.
[326.8s] So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away.
[332.3s] That was the technique.
[334.9s] So that was not quite the same group.
[338.4s] It was a larger group, but slightly different.

Victor Wong:
[341.0s] Nuco was part of that.

James Levin:
[342.5s] Nuco was part of that.
[344.3s] Also... by the way, we should introduce ourselves.
[349.6s] Yeah, hi, I’m Bobson Wilson.
[351.1s] I’m Head of Ecosystem at...
[354.3s] Strathclyde.

James Levin:
[356.1s] Jim James Levin, CEO of BlockApps.
[358.6s] Victor Wong.
[359.1s] Creators of StratoMechanica.

Victor Wong:
[360.6s] Yeah, and Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

James Levin:
[364.2s] Sorry, back.
[365.1s] But yeah, Amos as well.
[367.0s] Do you remember that?
[367.9s] Yeah.
[369.2s] Taiwan.
[369.9s] We should check in on that.
[371.7s] I hadn’t thought of Amos in several years until this moment.

James Levin:
[376.1s] So the interesting thing about what they were doing—so that was like some Taiwan consortium thing—
[382.2s] Yeah.
[382.6s] But then they did work on like Chinese cryptography and stuff. They’ve got differing requirements, right?
[390.9s] And the Masterchain, which was in Russia—that was like a Sberbank thing.

Bobson Wilson:
[402.0s] I have a question for you—it’s interesting because I was not at the EEA at that time, so it’s very interesting for me to hear—what were the hopes and the excitement that you saw? You know, you were part of those early conversations when this was created—13, I think, companies. It was a pretty big event, you know—as you mentioned, JPMorgan and everything—all those big names coming into the ecosystem—
[426.6s] what were the hopes and the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created 8 years ago?

James Levin:
[434.1s] ConsenSys was very critical as well, because they were doing a lot of the enterprise engagement stuff.
[443.8s] You had many, many companies like
[446.9s] starting to get interested in, “Hey, we want to do a pilot. We want to get involved.”
[452.3s] So ConsenSys was doing a lot of those.
[453.9s] So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together.
[458.7s] But yeah, over those months, you really had—they got a hell of a lot of momentum.
[466.1s] Yeah, really, really quick.

[The transcript continues in next message due to length…]

SPEAKER_00:
[895.1s] They know it's happening, they want to be involved.
[897.8s] And now, especially, there's less regulatory... you know.

[905.8s] The listeners may not know what Sibos is.
[908.0s] Oh yeah, so Sibos is the big SWIFT conference.
[911.5s] SWIFT, if you're not familiar, is a messaging system used by thousands of financial institutions around the world—it's actually a co-op.
[919.6s] It's a DAO for TradFi.
[921.5s] Kudos to Daniel from ConsenSys who said that to me once.

SPEAKER_02:
[925.3s] It is a DAO, although it's like—can we buy in now?
[928.5s] I feel like, you know, it's not... I guess we're scripted.
[931.9s] Yeah, you know, like token-gated.

SPEAKER_00:
[934.3s] The token is probably having a bank license.

SPEAKER_02:
[937.5s] The London Metal Exchange is like this too.
[939.3s] It's like—you want to sign up, you’ve got to buy a bunch of shares and then, you know, there's an annual fee and whatnot.
[945.7s] And you have to post someone there all the time.

SPEAKER_01:
[948.9s] You have to join the trade guild.

SPEAKER_00:
[950.8s] Yes.
[951.4s] Exactly.
[954.7s] And so that big conference is like the big meetup of payments, I would say, every year.
[959.9s] So you have all the big financial institutions, also global institutions like clearinghouses, settlements, your local regulators, etc.
[969.7s] But also all the banks.
[971.2s] And they gather there, and there's a lot of conversation.
[973.9s] What is very interesting is Sibos and SWIFT
[978.2s] is a very standards-focused organization because what they do is ensure that when we send messaging across all of us, everyone will understand it.
[988.3s] They used to have a different kind of messaging format,
[992.2s] and recently they’ve migrated to something new, which is ISO 20022. If you want to dive deeper, this is really how every financial institution wants to communicate.
[1004.2s] They've been working on that spec for a long time.
[1007.1s] And that's how anything that touches finance—
[1011.1s] from securities to payments—has to be qualified.

SPEAKER_02:
[1013.8s] Yeah, I think it's good to explain.
[1015.7s] So like, most of finance gets cleared through messaging.
[1022.1s] And it's like, crypto people are used to putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.
[1026.5s] It's not really like that.

SPEAKER_00:
[1028.4s] Oh yes.
[1028.8s] Thank you.
[1029.3s] Thank you.
[1029.8s] Yeah, indeed—that's a very key point.
[1034.4s] The process of what we call "delivery versus payment" in traditional finance
[1040.3s] is a pretty complex thing. How do you make sure that when you deliver the money, it's received, and that you receive the asset?
[1046.2s] There's a lot of back-and-forth messaging—
[1054.4s] it's not like in crypto, where you submit an atomic transaction.
[1062.2s] And when the transaction is complete—
[1064.2s] it's been executed, delivered, and all parties... Like, I give you the can.
[1071.3s] Well, I know, I know—you've been giving me the money, exactly.
[1076.9s] Whereas in TradFi, it's more of a dance.
[1081.5s] And so the blockchain here offers
[1085.7s] efficiencies. Because things that used to take T+1 or T+2 in traditional exchanges—now you can do it, depending on what chain, in seconds or even less.

SPEAKER_01:
[1100.8s] SWIFT isn’t a payments mechanism, right?
[1103.0s] It’s a messaging system.
[1104.2s] That’s another key point.

SPEAKER_02:
[1106.2s] Let me interject with a specific example.
[1109.6s] I think they’re biggest in FX, right?
[1111.6s] Yeah.
[1112.5s] So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euros.
[1116.5s] And we agree to a USD-Euro trade.
[1120.5s] So we look up whatever the pair is trading at.
[1124.7s] Then I send my side of the trade with a unique ID to SWIFT.
[1130.8s] And you do too.
[1132.6s] Then SWIFT checks if it matches.
[1136.6s] It charges like 7 bucks either way.
[1139.5s] If it does match, then it tells us that it matched.

SPEAKER_00:
[1144.0s] Well, I don't think it's exactly that way.
[1147.2s] SWIFT more or less offers a type of "envelope"—a format of envelope with paper and ink that we all know how to use and fill in.
[1156.7s] Then we trade those forms between different market participants.
[1161.2s] It’s not like you think—there are correspondent banks acting locally, doing cash handling, and everyone takes their share.

SPEAKER_02:
[1170.7s] It's not moving the asset.
[1172.3s] It’s just—
[1174.4s] I have the USD on my bank’s ledger.
[1177.4s] You've got the Euro on your bank’s ledger.

SPEAKER_00:
[1180.2s] Talking to each other in a secure and compliant way.
[1184.6s] Because also, oh—you sent what? You have to send specific messages for compliance.
[1189.4s] Then I send another one saying, hey, I checked, there's open information.

SPEAKER_01:
[1194.2s] A bunch of local jurisdiction-specific...

[1197.9s] Yeah, it’s like a lot of people and handshakes.

SPEAKER_02:
[1200.6s] Yeah, I think the way someone described it: it’s like a funny TCP handshake.

SPEAKER_03:
[1205.7s] It’s sort of like what they’re doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving.
[1212.5s] They have a list of IOUs.
[1214.7s] So when I send a SWIFT transaction—from say, the U.S. to you in France—I go to my bank and deposit $100. The money doesn't
[1226.6s] go anywhere.

SPEAKER_02:
[1228.2s] I have to write USD off my ledger.

SPEAKER_00:
[1232.3s] The net at the end of the day is handled via RTGS, which performs the actual transfer.
[1238.1s] It’s a different messaging system.
[1240.4s] If you research—and I’m not a SWIFT expert, but I had to learn more the past few months—it’s fascinating because there's such a huge dance to actually transfer money,
[1252.3s] because you have money in your bank account, but then there’s central bank money, deposit money,
[1258.1s] things like what we call M0, M1, M2.
[1262.6s] And all of that is pretty complex.
[1265.7s] And we’re just talking about payments here—we haven’t talked about securities or other financial instruments—
[1275.0s] which can also be exchanged using blockchain in a very efficient way.
[1280.1s] With stablecoins, you can make everything super simple.
[1286.3s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[1287.3s] Also, one misconception I’d love to mention is that stablecoins and CBDCs—
[1292.0s] are actually exactly the same thing, just in a different context.
[1295.7s] It's just the issuer.

[1297.2s] The issuer is different—
[1297.2s] we’re never going to actually touch CBDCs directly because that's the money banks use, so to speak.
[1306.5s] But from a technical level, they're almost copy-paste equivalents—same contracts and mechanisms.
[1313.9s] It’s not exact, but we create whole new language and terminology, when in reality they are very similar.
[1320.8s] And funny fact—
[1322.6s] those CBDCs—
[1322.6s] were developed when Ethereum was still a baby.
[1329.1s] Around Devcon 2—
[1331.7s] Ethereum was two years old.
[1333.8s] And we said, "Hey, come in here. You can manage the most critical infrastructure on the planet—money, trade..."
[1340.3s] And Ethereum can do all of this.
[1342.0s] I have to give the Ethereum Foundation credit—
[1347.0s] For a long time people said, “You don’t care about enterprise,”
[1351.1s] but they did the right thing. They protected that baby
[1355.1s] so it could grow.
[1356.5s] And now we’re at a stage—more than 10 years in—it’s more mature. Still not a teenager
[1363.7s] if we use the human analogy, which has its limits.
[1366.9s] But now Ethereum has the capability
[1382.6s] to meet all the challenges that have blocked institutions: scalability, privacy, composability, and interoperability—
[1386.0s] the four points you saw in the ARC paper from Circle.
[1394.2s] Just last week, zkSync announced up to 15,000 TPS.
[1403.2s] There’s a new announcement every week.
[1407.7s] Now when institutions look, they say,
[1407.7s] “I need privacy,”
[1414.1s] “I need this to be executed seamlessly.”
[1419.3s] And when they say "decentralization," I think what they really mean is: reduce vendor lock-in.
[1429.1s] You want your infrastructure to absorb your activity and be resilient.
[1433.3s] We still have work to do, because I understand institutions’ hesitation to use public infrastructure.
[1444.1s] It’s like when Wikipedia came around 20–25 years ago—
[1450.6s] I remember, I was in engineering school
[1455.9s] at the whiteboard suggesting we use a wiki for articles.
[1460.3s] And the professors said, “This is unacceptable.”

SPEAKER_03:
[1474.1s] To be clear—you are French.

SPEAKER_00:
[1477.2s] You are allowed to say that.
[1480.6s] But they were French too.
[1482.3s] Very strict and academic.
[1484.4s] And at the time I said, “We can trust something collectively built.”
[1489.5s] Now we know to take it with a grain of salt, but it’s actually widely accepted as reliable.

SPEAKER_03:
[1502.8s] Sorry, I was just going to ask—there’s always this gap between what traditional institutions understand, and what we know has been technically possible for a long time.
[1515.5s] Are there still gaps?
[1517.5s] Or do you think that’s been closed now?
[1519.4s] Like maybe Ethereum has “grown up,” but the knowledge gap still exists.

SPEAKER_00:
[1530.7s] Well, let me put it this way.
[1533.6s] If you combine all forms of money, there’s $123 trillion in cash globally.
[1543.9s] Only $300 billion of that is on-chain.
[1545.9s] The numbers speak for themselves—we're still early.
[1552.0s] So we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education.
[1552.0s] And by education, I mean product-level conversations.
[1552.0s] What business problem can this solve? How will it be maintained post-launch? How do you deal with specific use cases?
[1568.0s] Some teams are highly knowledgeable already—
[1579.3s] but as an ecosystem, we need to structure better support: who to work with, what vendors offer which services, what kind of contracts you’ll need, and a full perspective for new entrants.
[1595.7s] Some ask highly technical questions like,
[1603.2s] “We need to raise the contract size from 24 to 48 KB, and stack overflows are happening.”

SPEAKER_02:
[1614.4s] The stack depth one was always a problem.

SPEAKER_00:
[1616.9s] Exactly.
[1624.7s] But some product teams also ask, "Why should I go to an L2?”
[1626.6s] "What is an L1?"
[1627.5s] "What does it mean?"
[1628.6s] “And what about these upgrades?”
[1629.7s] “What are the primitives?”
[1631.5s] I explain: if you build on any L2, you might choose one vendor at first, but you can move assets freely across the ecosystem.
[1642.6s] Wallets stay the same.
[1644.1s] You don't have to rebuild a lot.
[1648.9s] These are things you have to explain.
[1652.0s] Some people still ask, “What is this? Is this just some scammy thing?”
[1659.3s] I think we find all types, but there is growing interest in what can be done with digital assets and tokenization.
[1671.1s] For those paying attention,
[1676.0s] I’m very excited about the next 6–12 months.
[1680.1s] The Genius Act was signed July 15 or so.
[1686.0s] The Clarity Act is also progressing.
[1691.1s] And companies are already asking, how do we implement this?
[1699.1s] FinTechs are moving too.
[1700.4s] Some are even building their own L1s—
[1700.4s] I wish they'd consider L2s. My door is always open. Great tools are available.
[1714.9s] That’s going to
[1717.0s] push the market, especially among financial institutions.
[1723.0s] Organizations like DTCC—the biggest clearinghouse in the world—
[1727.0s] all the world’s securities are essentially cleared through them—
[1730.6s] released an incredible product four months ago, in April: the Great Collateral.

SPEAKER_00:
[1735.5s] Where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contracts that allow you to clear and to make some margin calls and collateral management from different jurisdictions, which is a fantastic use case when you see.

[1748.5s] I'm not a collateral management expert, but I understand the value—like how this unlocks.

[1754.9s] You actually have something that you can take from your—

[1758.3s] You're back in Japan that you're going to post for something in the U.S. because you have a market event.

[1763.5s] And this is something you would not even imagine before.

[1766.3s] And now you can do it.

[1767.7s] And it's compliant.

[1769.0s] It's actually legal.

[1770.9s] And that can unlock so much efficiency.

[1773.9s] And so that's—in the next, like, 12 months—that's going to be a huge game changer.

SPEAKER_03:
[1779.1s] So it sounds like, you know, the lid has been lifted off and there's a ton of demand, but it's like walking down the path to supply that demand.

[1788.0s] That's the part that people are figuring out, right?

[1791.0s] Is that right?

SPEAKER_00:
[1792.5s] I think it's a very transformative technology for how those businesses operate.

[1799.4s] There’s also the question: how am I going to make money?

SPEAKER_03:
[1802.0s] Okay.

[1803.4s] So there's a fear element to it, right?

SPEAKER_00:
[1806.8s] It's like, well, now I can have—like, I'm a PSP provider—

SPEAKER_02:
[1813.2s] Let me ask you this.

[1814.2s] So in the early days, it felt like there was a focus on more like back-office use cases.

[1820.3s] Like, yeah, how do I move the collateral from, like, my Japan regional branch to my—you know, whatever.

[1826.7s] Business process improvements.

[1828.0s] Business process improvements.

[1830.9s] And I felt that there eventually became a—this started around 2020, 2021—a shift for big corporations wanting top-line use cases.

[1843.5s] Like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs.

[1847.6s] And then you're seeing—I think like the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to—

[1854.3s] Like, the company doesn't have to IPO,

[1860.3s] but there could be a token, and there can be something that provides the traditional protections of equity that's publicly traded.

[1869.6s] And then you could just leave this part where it was, and somehow there's kind of a merger going on.

[1877.0s] And this is creating good top-line revenue for investment banks and, you know, etc., etc.

[1883.8s] So is your sense that—

[1889.0s] People want the efficiency to compete? Or are they starting to think about it as a new revenue line, or a transformed revenue line or something?

SPEAKER_00:
[1905.4s] Well, that’s the billion—or trillion—dollar question right there.

[1910.6s] I don't have the answer.

[1912.8s] What I can say is I see—I think if you look at operational optimization, it's more than that.

[1920.3s] If you let capital flow more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial flow.

[1925.5s] So the more you have a flow of your money that's easy, the more you're going to be able to make some—because you're going to unlock, you know, some—

[1934.6s] Some capital improvement.

[1937.8s] Yet, I think from my conversations and what I’ve seen, we still don't have the golden goose that lets us say, “Hey, that’s going to remix everything,” in terms of all the different people and intermediaries.

[1954.9s] Because if you suddenly have something that is being done in a much more efficient way, well, different intermediaries might have to rethink the way they do business.

[1966.0s] This is not going to happen overnight.

[1969.3s] What I can say is that because we're going to have these new forms of working with digital assets, it's going to be more of a golden era for opportunities to build pretty fantastic products.

[1982.3s] And the people that understand both the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and also blockchain in general,

[1991.3s] and understand operations in traditional finance, and are able to bridge those two, they're going to be able to build some amazing, amazing products.

[1999.6s] And that's what we see a little bit now with the convergence—Aave is doing a collateral product with Horizon and—knocking you know—you have Figure, and you have a spike.

[2011.5s] As we're going to now have some assets on-chain that maybe you can loan, you can collateralize, you can borrow money, and you can have some—

[2021.2s] Liquidity in front of those assets while being the action.

[2026.2s] Also, I want to stress—we say “RWAs,” “RWAs,” “RWAs.”

[2031.5s] We probably need to find some new language.

SPEAKER_03:
[2035.3s] You know how I feel about that.

[2036.6s] I think the “RWA” term is so broad.

SPEAKER_00:
[2041.1s] This can be an RWA.

[2043.5s] And I can also take a picture of my, I guess, my bank account and say, "Hey, this is a tokenization of my bank account."

[2051.9s] So there are all kinds of ways, but most of them are actually kind of elaborate IOUs.

[2059.4s] And now we're moving towards having more and more standards and—

[2064.4s] Things like the legal tent.

[2067.2s] You want the native issuer.

[2071.1s] The token is the legal claim to the asset.

[2075.9s] When that happens and we focus on that, that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things.

[2085.3s] You connect this with DeFi—you’re going to always need some form of AML, KYC, and everything.

[2092.3s] Like for DeFi—there’s none for the last year—

[2096.6s] It's—

[2097.1s] There are probably going to be two of those.

[2099.1s] But once you connect this, I think that's going to be pretty incredible.

SPEAKER_03:
[2102.9s] But how do institutions feel about—obviously, as the head of the EA, and you feel strongly about Ethereum, right?

[2110.4s] Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly—L1s, L2s—

[2114.4s] How do they feel about that?

[2116.4s] Do they see any other—you know, we know that Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time—

[2123.3s] Are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point?

[2126.4s] Or are they—

[2127.1s] Looking? Are they still needing to be convinced?

SPEAKER_00:
[2131.2s] I've heard several executives at presentations at Sibos saying, “Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard.”

[2139.1s] This is the ecosystem.

[2141.6s] Having said that, and as decision-makers, they also want to make sure they keep the door open and not get locked in.

[2148.4s] So they move progressively.

[2150.7s] Sixty percent of the stablecoin issuance is on Ethereum.

[2154.4s] I think probably 85–90% of all RWAs—same.

[2159.3s] Similar statistics for DeFi activity.

[2161.4s] Electric Capital—you can see a graph—three times more builders than any other ecosystem.

[2170.3s] So it’s the most radiant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet.

[2178.5s] That they know. They recognize that.

[2181.3s] But it still means we need to keep educating, keep working. Like the Ethereum Foundation, for instance—they’ve done incredible work these last few months repackaging the message in a way that’s more digestible.

[2195.6s] But there’s also protocol teams already addressing many of the fears that digital asset managers in financial institutions might have.

[2206.2s] But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that’s easy to understand—that's some of the work being done as we speak.

[2215.8s] And that’s going to really help continue solidifying that dominant position.

[2221.5s] But to also answer your question—

[2223.2s] Some of those institutions say, “Hey, we want to be multi-chain.”

[2226.2s] We want to look at everything, which is absolutely fair.

[2230.1s] I would do the same if I were in their shoes.

[2232.3s] So, okay, they have different assessment criteria.

[2236.2s] And they say, “We’re going to take this chain, this chain, this chain.”

[2239.8s] And then we’ll see.

SPEAKER_01:
[2242.6s] Beyond EVM, I mean—you’ve obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors.

[2252.4s] What is the competition outside of that?

[2257.6s] Because I know there’s—obviously competition within that—but are institutions doing non-EVM things as well?

SPEAKER_02:
[2268.5s] Just like hints around—I don’t know what they’re using.

[2273.1s] Do institutions use Solana at all?

[2275.3s] I know—but does DA still have its own big proprietary-ish stack?

SPEAKER_01:
[2280.7s] It's not proprietary anymore, but it’s—yeah.

[2284.2s] Well, Hedera.

[2286.7s] No, I'm using Hedera.

SPEAKER_00:
[2288.7s] What do you hear?

[2289.6s] Canton is probably the most advanced in terms of connection with traditional finance.

[2299.2s] I would say—well, not the rest—but in traditional finance they have a way it’s structured.

[2307.1s] It’s—

[2308.0s] It’s something I still don't completely understand.

[2310.7s] You can be validators, have some tokens that they're going to exchange on some private market,

[2316.3s] and some form of revenue.

[2318.5s] And then they already have that.

[2320.3s] It’s a consortium—like a Quorum v2, I would say.

[2325.5s] And they've been able to bring in a lot of the financial institutions.

[2332.5s] But once again—

[2336.1s] And if you ask me—and I'm biased of course—but this ecosystem… Like, Canton code is open source and everything, but you're still building on a technology that isn't very widely used.

[2352.6s] Like, when you're the CIO of a company and need maintenance—what, 20 guys in a country can do the work on this?

[2360.4s] And that’s the way I look at it.

[2364.9s] But I don’t think Solana—I’m not sure about institutions.

SPEAKER_02:
[2371.1s] I don’t hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

SPEAKER_03:
[2376.2s] Oddly enough, Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don’t hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

SPEAKER_01:
[2383.4s] Nobody ever used Ripple.

SPEAKER_00:
[2386.2s] I’ve been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019.

[2393.8s] I spent almost four years at ChainSafe—very authentic, crypto-native protocol development.

[2402.8s] And I’ve been to conferences with the engineers and asked them in a very candid way, “Have you ever built on Ripple or something else?”

[2412.8s] And I had conversations with the engineers at ChainSafe—

[2416.7s] We had some polls, and some conversations in Slack, and no one really came up with anything compelling.

SPEAKER_01:
[2423.0s] Ripple’s just got an infinite war chest for marketing and lobbying.

SPEAKER_03:
[2428.5s] One of the Siboses I went to—years and years ago—Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth.

[2434.5s] And SWIFT decided, “Oh, they're too much of a competitor,” so they kicked them out.

SPEAKER_02:
[2444.5s] They were calling themselves the SWIFT killer.

SPEAKER_03:
[2450.3s] Ripple decided, you know what, we’ll just run our own conference in parallel with Sibos.

[2457.9s] They put on a parallel conference—and Vitalik was speaking at their conference.

[2463.1s] At the Ripple one?

[2463.9s] At the Ripple one.

[2464.8s] I remember they had buses in front of the Sibos conference taking people to their venue.

[2473.8s] I remember seeing Vitalik running across, looking for the conference, because it was in a new place we were all trying to figure out.

[2482.6s] I remember waving at him like, “Over here, Vitalik, over there.”

[2486.4s] Sorry.

[2487.3s] It's—

SPEAKER_00:
[2489.1s] Are people still using Corda?

[2490.8s] R3?

[2491.5s] Like it’s been bought out by—Sella? Corda and Sella?

SPEAKER_01:
[2495.5s] Really?

[2496.6s] I don’t think they’d actually use those terms.

[2500.7s] It’s a partnership—a collaboration.

[2503.2s] Not absolutely—they weren’t bought.

SPEAKER_03:
[2507.3s] Not bought out, but yes.

[2510.1s] I mean, I will say...

SPEAKER_01:
[2511.7s] Anyone using Fabric still?

[2514.3s] Fabric?

SPEAKER_00:
[2514.6s] Well, yes.

[2516.2s] Behind the scenes, Fabric is still very present.

[2520.2s] I think central banks and those types of very closed environments—

[2525.6s] I’m not sure—the BIS, Bank for International Settlements—which for those who don’t know is like 40 different international banks that work together to optimize collaboration and exchange—

[2542.6s] They had a project, Agora, that started a couple months ago.

[2550.3s] Those are institutions where it takes much longer time.

[2553.3s] That's the Danzig and Youth project?

[2555.9s] No, it's the same Agora.

[2558.3s] But I imagine maybe they were doing POCs before.

[2561.5s] I know a few central banks that ran something using Fabric.

SPEAKER_01:
[2565.9s] It's probably like the asbestos, isn't it?

[2570.2s] Just going to take years to check out.

SPEAKER_03:
[2576.2s] You need people in suits.

[2580.1s] I will say—I think we're almost at 45 minutes.

[2583.1s] Revlon has been very generous with their time.

[2585.3s] Do you have any final thoughts you want to share with everyone?

SPEAKER_00:
[2590.2s] Actually, on Fabric—I know IBM is working on a bridge between Fabric and Ethereum.

[2599.0s] It’s called FabricX. You can see that on there.

SPEAKER_01:
[2601.1s] Right. One of their big sells at New York Blockchain Week in 2018 was their EVM integration.

[2613.3s] Yeah, the channel or something.

[2616.4s] About 3.js or whatever—they did a merging, and that used Burrow, right?

[2624.8s] Because Burrow went into Hyperledger before—

[2631.1s] For Bellew.

[2632.8s] And that was the continuation of ErisDB, Monax, onuend—

[2639.4s] That was never mainnet-compatible, though.

[2642.8s] But there was that Go-EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing.
[2647.7s] So they could wham those together.
[2651.2s] And I mean, that's seven years ago.
[2655.7s] So yeah, I'm sure that they
[2658.0s] they need to have an even better EVM story these days.

SPEAKER_00:
[2661.4s] To answer your question, EVM and Ethereum is really the standard—as everyone, that's what they're saying.
[2670.8s] You go through some different stages.
[2672.6s] You have the Chief Innovation Officer of SWIFT and some different institutions.
[2678.4s] They understand that.
[2680.6s] That's what they say.
[2681.8s] Everywhere I went on all those different panels—we had a panel at 8:30, I'm like,
[2687.7s] permissionless, very private network.

[2690.5s] It was hosted by Applied Blockchain, a member of the EEA.
[2693.9s] There was like Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, Ubix, and me.
[2700.4s] And it was—we were full, there were people standing up, and there was, you know, the SWIFT innovation officers, some other banks that came to talk to us.
[2710.0s] People—they understand.
[2712.0s] Ethereum is definitely seen as the standard and the place where you want to build, because that's where you have access to the most equity, the most users, the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem.

[2730.3s] Which is something that is getting closer, I think, and they say, "Well, maybe there is some way to make some money here."
[2731.7s] I don't know exactly
[2735.1s] how, but there is some potential.
[2737.0s] So I think the future is very bright for us.

SPEAKER_01:
[2737.8s] And I think that ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation and about the thoughts for the EEA and so on. It was something that Jeremy Miller said in the opening speech on the opening day—was think of this as being like a router: an internet intranet.
[2757.8s] There's no reason why suitably modular codebases shouldn't serve all of these use cases—public and private.
[2768.2s] And what we did not want to happen—and I remember being driven very much by this—was saying, let's not have arbitrarily different
[2779.3s] codebases for these different things, because we can't be arsed having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds.

[2788.8s] And that was really coming from that Fabric and Corda competition of these big enterprises basically sort of being told:
[2798.3s] "You Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we're going to get mandated to use this other stuff."
[2803.3s] And it doesn't matter what you want.
[2804.9s] It's like the spending all have been spent and it's never coming back.
[2810.4s] So I think it's, to my mind, it's like really superb to see where we are.
[2815.6s] It's like—that's what we were thinking.
[2817.8s] That was kind of the goal, right?
[2819.3s] Is that this can be a standard for everything and—
[2822.9s] Yeah, things were immature and maybe, you know, you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up.
[2833.1s] But really, it's like this can be the answer for everything.
[2837.0s] So, yeah, I do think that's where we are.

SPEAKER_00:
[2839.1s] And we're talking more and more. You know, the Ethereum Foundation has done an incredible job.
[2843.3s] They have like an enterprise team also that is in conversation with everyone, and they have access to all the different leaders.
[2850.5s] And this has been very
[2852.2s] pretty fantastic.

[2853.9s] And so, the more we discuss about this and say, "Hey, you know, there is no CEO of Ethereum, it's not a private company—there's no CEO of the internet," you know, it has that
[2865.4s] ethos. So that's something that is
[2867.2s] catching on more and more. And the more we grow, that's also like the mission at what we do at EEA—like having these conversations, doing events, bringing people together from a few different areas.
[2880.0s] We try to really mix DeFi, traditional finance institutions, pure Ethereum players—and have all those people talking together.
[2885.1s] That's how we make progress, you know, moving forward.

SPEAKER_03:
[2889.3s] Well, on that note, I think we'll wrap up.
[2892.1s] But where can people find more about you and EEA in general?

SPEAKER_00:
[2896.6s] Well, the website—we are present on all the social media.
[2900.0s] The website is entalliance.org.
[2904.2s] We have the same handle on Twitter, on LinkedIn.
[2907.4s] I'm also on LinkedIn and Twitter.
[2909.1s] And I try to post often—some articles and some insights.
[2913.0s] And there's some more work that I'm going to put together in a couple of weeks around AWAs and everything.
[2918.9s] And also always looking for some large institutions that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces.
[2925.8s] Yeah.
[2926.0s] So we can really provide some thought leadership and help explain what's being done.
[2932.6s] And I think bridging the Ethereum world with traditional finance is also something that we're pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks.
[2939.6s] Yeah, that's awesome.
[2940.6s] We'll be at Singapore FinTech Week next month, at Devcon in Argentina, and we'll also be in Abu Dhabi for Finance Week.

SPEAKER_03:
[2948.9s] Cool.

SPEAKER_01:
[2949.9s] And Bob, where can people find you?
[2951.7s] So, yeah, I'm on Twitter.
[2953.6s] Same as my name—Bob Summerville, with a W-I-L-L, not Ville. Not Summerville.

SPEAKER_03:
[2961.7s] Not the German spelling?

SPEAKER_01:
[2963.2s] No.

SPEAKER_03:
[2963.7s] Yeah. Karen?

SPEAKER_02:
[2966.1s] K. James Lubin on X, YouTube, etc.

SPEAKER_03:
[2971.4s] And you can find me on X and
[2974.5s] Vic—V-I-C, the number 4, W-O-N-G.
[2978.5s] Thank you for joining us for our first in-person roundtable.

SPEAKER_00:
[2982.9s] Thanks again.
[2983.7s] It's awesome.
[2984.5s] Thanks for coming.
[2985.3s] Take care.
[2985.8s] Thank you.
[2987.5s] It's pretty cool to be in Bushwick again.
