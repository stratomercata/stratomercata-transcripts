VICTOR WONG:
[3.0s] OK, I think we are live.

KAREN:
[6.4s] Live?
[7.8s] Us?

VICTOR WONG:
[12.0s] Let's just give a minute for people to join.

KAREN:
[16.0s] All righty.

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[23.9s] So I looked at the background noise reduction.
[26.4s] It says not supported in this browser.
[29.7s] I'm using Firefox.
[31.0s] Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

KAREN:
[33.3s] Yes.
[35.7s] You must pick from the two available choices.
[40.1s] Safari.

VICTOR WONG:
[40.9s] Yeah, Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone.

KAREN:
[48.7s] Is Edge — is it called Edge still?
[51.8s] Yes.

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[52.0s] Yes.
[52.8s] Nobody uses Edge.
[54.2s] Nobody.

KAREN:
[54.6s] Nobody uses it.
[56.4s] I bet you it’s a lot, hold on.

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[59.3s] I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember if it was on Edge or Bing or probably both, but the most searched thing was "how to install Chrome."

KAREN:
[70.3s] That's funny.
[71.9s] Try though, they might — wow, Chrome just continues to rise in market share.
[76.8s] It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide.
[86.1s] Safari is trending down.
[89.8s] Yeah, they're just pretty tiny.
[94.9s] Wow, Opera is still around.
[96.9s] That's amazing.

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[100.0s] They all use Chromium now.

KAREN:
[102.0s] OK, fair enough.

VICTOR WONG:
[105.0s] Oddly, my son uses Opera.
[107.1s] OK, we are live now on Twitter.
[110.5s] Live, live.
[113.4s] OK, so should we
[116.7s] Should we wait another minute or should we just start?

KAREN:
[123.2s] That's a good question.
[124.3s] We can ease into the substance of the content.
[127.6s] Do we have any minute-long non sequiturs?

VICTOR WONG:
[131.5s] Code opens.
[136.5s] Well, maybe we should do our intros because we...

KAREN:
[139.4s] OK, we could do the intros.

VICTOR WONG:
[141.4s] So hi, everyone.
[143.0s] Welcome to our weekly show.
[146.5s] If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercado project — that is a Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses.
[160.5s] Now, the three of us here are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs.
[167.6s] I'm Victor Wong.

KAREN:
[169.2s] I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG.
[171.6s] I think someone else has to.

VICTOR WONG:
[173.4s] Someone has to bestow that.
[175.3s] Exactly.
[176.2s] OK, you two are OGs.
[178.7s] Can we say it to each other?

KAREN:
[180.9s] You are an OG.
[183.1s] I said that as a collective.
[186.2s] In a circle.

VICTOR WONG:
[187.3s] Right, exactly.

KAREN:
[188.3s] You can tell Bob, Bob's an OG, Bob can tell me, I can tell you.

VICTOR WONG:
[192.1s] Yes.
[192.6s] So, you know, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey.
[201.6s] So you'll get hopefully no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today.
[210.5s] And today we are going to talk
[212.9s] about the highlights from Token 2049.
[217.9s] And was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world?
[222.5s] Joining me is Bob Summerwell.
[224.6s] Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[226.7s] Hi there, I'm Bob Summerwell.
[229.0s] We're not old, we're all very experienced.
[234.8s] But yes, I’m Head of Ecosystem.

VICTOR WONG:
[238.4s] And Kieran, of course.

KAREN:
[240.3s] Yeah.
[242.4s] I am also experienced — you know, not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it, right?
[248.7s] Like we've really been around for some time.
[252.4s] But yes, I’m...

VICTOR WONG:
[253.9s] I will bestow the OG title on you, Karen.
[256.5s] So we could go...
[259.6s] I mean, anyone that’s been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, that would be... we can claim that title.

KAREN:
[269.9s] Ah, how the time goes.

VICTOR WONG:
[273.9s] So I will say that I was not in Singapore.
[278.1s] I kind of played hooky with Kieran's approval.
[282.7s] You know, international travel is brutal.
[285.4s] But Bob and Kieran were there.
[288.2s] And I wanted to get your kind of impressions.
[291.7s] What do you think the big themes this year were at Token 2049?

KAREN:
[295.9s] Yeah.
[298.2s] A bunch of big topics.
[300.4s] One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished.
[308.6s] And there was a lot of that the previous year.

VICTOR WONG:
[313.3s] I'd pour one out for the meme coins, basically.

KAREN:
[317.6s] In meme coins' defense, I'm actually kind of pro-meme coin.
[321.8s] The problem is just the time horizon — people want to make money in like seconds.
[326.5s] Like I think if
[328.1s] A meme around a concept, if it can kind of grow organically for some period of time, is like great.
[333.8s] But yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle.
[339.2s] But maybe not this one.
[341.2s] So the conference felt kind of less scammy in general.
[347.1s] And a lot of digital asset treasury talk.
[350.5s] I think we can go into that as we go.
[353.1s] A lot of stablecoin talk.
[356.0s] You know, a lot of, you know, merger with TradFi sort of feel.
[364.2s] I also think something has changed.
[365.9s] And I can't tell, like, if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content, or something's qualitatively different about the world where like,
[377.0s] A year ago, it felt like crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world.
[385.2s] And now it feels like it's like a big part of the solution.
[389.4s] It's very strange.
[390.9s] And everyone sort of acknowledges that. You know, like Donald Trump Jr.—Donald Trump Jr. was there.
[396.5s] Like, that's a big changeover where you just feel—
[401.2s] And, you know, some weeks ago, like Putin made his comments about how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation — which is probably true.
[412.8s] But it's like that's a big turnaround.
[414.6s] It's like a from-the-top policy as opposed to just... and you felt that at the conference as well.

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[422.9s] Well, I mean, that wasn’t new on the Bitcoin conference side.
[426.9s] So I was in Nashville 2024 and then this July in Vegas.
[438.9s] So in Nashville last year, you had Trump,
[442.4s] RFK Jr. Then this year you had both Trump boys — Don Jr. and Eric — were both there.
[454.3s] Oh my goodness, I'm forgetting his name from the UK.
[460.6s] That will come to me in a second. But yeah, and also, you know, like tons of other Congress people and state-level stuff. That’s been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side.
[490.8s] I mean, I guess essentially because you've just already got that monetary store-of-value use case — it’s like getting into these boring ETF,
[497.4s] you know, treasury-company,
[497.6s] government-level adoption sort of stuff — that's happened earlier on the Bitcoin side than more generally.
[497.4s] But yeah, also, I mean obviously, like the Trumps have got their World Liberty nonsense going on and got to be pumping that one.

VICTOR WONG:
[508.2s] Well, actually, that's a good transition.
[510.3s] Internally, we were trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual.
[519.1s] You kind of have talked about the boring elements, I guess — more institutional.
[525.6s] And I'm curious, since this is in Singapore — a very global conference —
[530.4s] What countries outside the U.S. seem to be moving in this direction?
[536.5s] Obviously, the U.S. has been a holdup for a really long time.
[540.3s] But, you know, how are things getting boring and how are things getting more global?

KAREN:
[545.0s] Bob, I want to remind you not to criticize our friends in Washington, at least in a public forum.
[551.4s] Supporters of the...

BOB SUMMERWELL:
[554.9s] I'm not getting back in.

KAREN:
[557.8s] So it's an interesting feel that the conference, I would say, obviously represented people who are close by pretty well.
[570.8s] But also, you know, some — a good number of people in from let’s say UAE, some Europe, plenty of Americans who did the really long trip — lots, lots of Americans, I would say.
[582.8s] And yeah, I think it's a strange—
[587.8s] The institutional feeling was much stronger than the prior year.
[592.3s] And it's not that much time to have passed.
[594.9s] Like there were many, you know — the stablecoins have this institutional feel to them.
[603.5s] At the beginning, they didn’t.
[605.9s] And it is funny to watch — I see these announcements like Tether’s coming to the U.S.,
[609.6s] you know, setting up a nice regulatory framework that they can work with.
[614.0s] And I went to a side event and met some of the Tether people.

Alex Van de Sande:
[994.1s] And it's gotten almost like a mirror of the public equity markets, in which people are—

[1002.6s] Something I might want to talk about at more length another time: I keep seeing criticism of, say, Uniswap, because they generate a lot of fees.

[1011.6s] But a lot of those fees go directly to the Labs company, and they don't go—

[1017.1s] to the protocol. Or they have to turn the protocol fees on, and would then start theoretically buying back the token.

[1025.5s] Whereas folks like HyperLiquid—there's no Labs skim, and there are pretty big buybacks going on, and the token price has gone up.

[1033.4s] And, you know, people argue Uniswap has a kind of conflict of interest there.

[1037.5s] But anyway, the point being like—suddenly it all became about revenue, U.S. dollar-denominated yields, like how to do—

[1040.7s] Not quite a SPAC. Like, most of these treasury companies are an existing publicly traded company,

[1053.2s] and there's maybe not a formal takeover with a change of control, but usually like an injection of capital. The company is doing something else right now,

[1063.3s] and then it starts digital asset treasury operations.

[1068.4s] You know, like—there was a panel. Tom Lee gave a lot of like

[1075.9s] numbers on how big his digital asset treasury company is, what chunk of ETH it holds now, what the trend is, all that sort of thing.

[1088.7s] And they've—I guess Michael Saylor kind of pioneered—I don't know if he was there, I don't think he was—some of the financial engineering that kind of creatively let him acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.

[1101.7s] And all these folks are then kind of—

[1105.1s] In the, I would argue, part of the TradFi mindset. People make complicated products that sort of favor the house, in a sense, so that—

[1117.4s] you know, no matter what, like, the client has an idea, but the institution does OK.

[1122.6s] Right.

[1123.1s] And some analog of that is going on.

[1125.9s] You know, people are purchasing—like a lot of the time you would just want to hold tokens directly as opposed to invest in a digital asset treasury.

[1135.0s] I guess I think the digital asset treasuries may be better than the ETFs.

[1138.5s] The ETFs promise to do nothing and charge a fee, whereas the digital asset treasuries don't really charge a fee and maybe do something creative.

[1147.7s] So, you know, it's like the entrance of a new venue of financial engineering.

[1155.0s] But I also think they're kind of brilliant in the following sense:

[1158.7s] It's a tremendous pain to be a publicly traded, say, U.S. company.

[1164.0s] It's expensive.

[1164.6s] There's a lot of compliance burden and so on.

[1169.1s] Tokens are out there.

[1170.8s] They get liquidity in some ways.

[1174.7s] You might want liquidity from the U.S. public equity markets for your token.

[1180.5s] You could do this by IPOing a company—like Coinbase is sort of a vehicle for that.

[1185.9s] But then you've got to report on the extremely complicated, no doubt, operations of Coinbase and its whatever-thousand employees and all that.

[1193.8s] Or you could just have a thing—buy the token.

[1196.9s] I mean, you never have to IPO the Labs company, and you can kind of just get all of the capital without

[1205.4s] the much heavier reporting burden of being a publicly traded actual company.

[1212.0s] And this is kind of genius. Like, it's a great way to bring in more kind of bigger, more boring, more conservative capital while not changing the premise that much.

[1228.0s] So yeah, it’s gotten—the suits are good at that.

[1232.2s] And the digital asset treasuries provide a good wrapper for the thing that probably most of us would hold as spot.

Aya Miyaguchi:
[1242.9s] By the way, we have a comment from Shiva, who says he loves your take on meme ecosystems.

[1249.5s] Yeah.

[1250.2s] Yeah.

[1250.9s] Not surprisingly, someone who has their own meme ecosystem.

[1255.0s] You got to hold all the memes.

[1256.2s] That's the key.

[1256.7s] Shout out to you, Shiva.

[1258.8s] Bob, so what do you think about treasuries and stablecoins?

Bob Summerwill:
[1264.3s] Yeah, I mean, you know, I guess this is all sort of maturity. And it's a strange kind of feeling, you know, looking back on all of our joint experience, sort of on Enterprise Ethereum efforts kicking off in 2016, 2017—

[1290.2s] and really the thought there that all of these public and private use cases could all be met by suitably modular codebases and thinking EVMs.

[1299.8s] And, you know, here we are. You've got Stripe announcing Tempo and having a consortium of—

[1312.8s] companies doing that kind of payments setup.

[1317.2s] And then you’ve got NASDAQ announcing equities on-chain again with a Bazoo derivative.

[1328.7s] And then you've got Base and Coinbase, and all of these things are happening

[1335.4s] in a very similar kind of form to what we were shooting for all that time back. And while these things are kind of a bit boring, it is also quite amazing that we've got to that place—

[1351.5s] that these very conservative incumbents have caught up without thinking. You know, it's pretty amazing.

Aya Miyaguchi:
[1363.4s] Well, I think part of it—and maybe one of the reasons as builders we find it boring—is that effectively, there are no tech innovations really that are driving this, right?

[1373.1s] It's really about people who already have a bunch of money,

[1378.0s] pouring more money into it.

Alex Van de Sande:
[1382.5s] At a time, you know—I think much of the space was extremely eager for institutional approval, even with

[1393.0s] some nominal hostility to it.

[1396.8s] And I now feel the emotion that I'm like—I almost don't want it.

[1400.4s] I'm like, get out of here.

[1401.7s] I want it to go back.

[1404.9s] I guess I'm happy maybe about the asset values, although it's not my primary motivation at all.

[1413.4s] But I hope that they don't—because the thing you see with, like,

[1419.9s] you know, the Web2 world—while the internet remains at least kind of open, people use like six apps.

[1434.8s] And so it's just pretty easy to affect the whole planet of users of the internet through these six apps.

[1444.6s] And I kind of—

[1446.3s] It could easily happen that way in crypto, where crypto itself remains totally open.

[1453.2s] But like, as a for-instance: so as a company, we have a Coinbase account, which we use a little bit.

[1461.0s] And they are way more difficult and onerous, making information requests all the time, than any bank I've dealt with.

[1472.1s] It's bizarre.

[1472.9s] Like they tried to introduce a whitelist for the accounts you could send out to—this was like a month ago. Apparently, you could turn this feature off, and it's "for your protection," you know, in case someone's gotten in there.

[1487.1s] But it's like—you're worse than the thing you said that you were setting out to destroy, from a "is it our money" perspective.

[1498.4s] And that feels—

[1502.7s] You know, I'm happy that the Genius Act passed, I think. But it also has that feel too.

[1509.7s] Coinbase itself is now in a fight with the Feds, like "Wait, wait, wait—we didn’t mean you could do this. We wanted all yield banned."

Bob Summerwill:
[1521.1s] Yeah, well, I mean, I guess they do get leaned on more than the banks.

[1526.1s] Right, because they're kind of in this new-energy area.

[1529.2s] So, you know, all of this stuff is just very rigid and defined, and the borders never move on the bank side.

[1538.4s] But then, you know, on a crypto exchange side, it's kind of a bit of both.

[1542.5s] And so they're always going to be moving around a bit, and they're always going to get whacked down.

Alex Van de Sande:
[1546.9s] I think fintechs in general—they're maybe a little leaner, probably a little faster on things than the banks.

[1555.3s] And it almost feels like they're overzealous in terms of their compliance posture because they feel that they can get kicked around in a way the banks are just a little less worried.

[1568.5s] You know, tons of them have been leaned on too, right? In very much the same way.

[1574.0s] But it seems like a slower and less aggressive process somehow.

Bob Summerwill:
[1578.9s] Well, yeah—well, I mean, because they’re generally not trying to do new things, right?

[1584.9s] You know, the fintechs are moving around.

[1586.6s] So it might be like, we're all compliant and good today—

[1589.6s] but then we might be doing a new thing next week.

[1591.5s] And oh no—they don't like that.

[1593.1s] So we've got to be on good behavior, get the brownie points.

[1597.3s] Whereas the banks are very rarely doing anything new and different.

[1600.5s] So they don't really worry so much, I don't think.

Aya Miyaguchi:
[1605.8s] Yeah, I mean, I kind of feel like what we've really seen is—regulation was like the lid on a bucket.

[1613.1s] And the minute you move that lid, the demand—the real level of demand that we're seeing now—is what sort of always existed, but it's just been held back for a really long time.

UNKNOWN:
[1623.6s] Yeah.

Alex Van de Sande:
[1623.7s] The Circle IPO was kind of crazy.

[1627.4s] It showed, you know, just how much it went up after listing—like how much pent-up demand is out there if this is even slightly allowed.

Aya Miyaguchi:
[1636.6s] Yeah.

[1637.1s] And I feel like the treasury companies are a similar thing.

[1639.9s] Definitely.

[1641.6s] While we're getting to that point—how do you think things are getting a little bit more crazier than last year?

(Transcript continues below...)

SPEAKER_00:
[2016.8s] And if you imagine if you, like, made all the businesses publicly traded, most of the stocks would go to zero.
[2022.2s] So you would kind of expect in crypto that, like, most tokens are bad.
[2026.7s] You know, it's sort of like what you would see if you just made essentially no barriers to entry to publicly listing stock—not that tokens are stock, but anyway.
[2037.3s] So, however, if you kind of market-cap weight,
[2043.3s] you would probably find that the things near the top are pretty high quality.
[2048.7s] And then sometimes things will come out of the bottom and go into the top, but by and large, you should sort of forget about that long tail of things.
[2056.6s] And it did feel like, to a significant degree, the eye was on the big things, and it tried to destroy them before there was a token—or freeze them or what have you.
[2068.0s] Um, and,
[2071.5s] it left the bad stuff to run amok, contributing to the impression that the space was just all scams.
[2078.5s] And it might be all scams by number of projects.
[2083.4s] The average project might be a scam, or just not worth any value.
[2086.2s] But the average business is not a good business.
[2089.7s] But the big ones are good most of the time—not all the time.
[2096.3s] And they're kind of just being allowed out.
[2099.3s] Circle IPO—good example. MetaMask token—you know, like, probably they should have had one a long time ago. Like, yeah, for a long time, they probably wanted a token.

SPEAKER_00:
[2108.3s] Yeah, well, I remember the height of this for me was when the SEC filed charges against Binance and Coinbase in the same week.
[2116.7s] It's like, we're just gonna look at something with the word "exchange" in it and then go after that, right?
[2122.5s] Like, it's like the most compliant exchange, and the least compliant exchange.

SPEAKER_02:
[2126.5s] No, it is.
[2128.0s] I mean, the other thing that you have there was—yeah, it was like the good actors that were getting the legal action.
[2136.0s] Yes, exactly.
[2137.0s] Basically because the good actors were staying onshore and trying to work through the thing and get to a resolution.
[2146.6s] Whereas all the baddies are just like, "Yeah, we're out of here.
[2149.3s] We're not serving U.S. people.
[2151.1s] We're scumming away.
[2153.0s] We're not even going to make any effort to be compliant with anything, and you can't get us."
[2158.1s] So it was almost by definition that the good actors were the ones that got whacked because they stayed around to get whacked—and kept coming back for more and more whacking until the whacking ceased eventually.

[2173.0s] But yeah, I mean, I think—
[2176.6s] another crazy thing is, I think we're going to have masses of ICOs—like tons and tons of them coming up.

SPEAKER_00:
[2184.3s] Well, on that, I think we've crossed the 30-minute mark.
[2188.1s] I want to ask you guys, do you have any closing thoughts about Token2049 or where we're at in the overall state of blockchain?

SPEAKER_01:
[2198.5s] Uh, one thing I would say—I was reminded, the food is excellent in Singapore if you're into hawker markets. There was a hawker market in the conference.

SPEAKER_00:
[2207.7s] It was kind of crazy.

SPEAKER_01:
[2208.6s] They, like, made one! You know, it was very cool.
[2211.0s] That's awesome.
[2212.1s] Um. I'm pretty optimistic.
[2214.6s] These are good times.
[2216.1s] A lot of work ahead, obviously.
[2222.1s] But yeah, it feels like it was a good marker of some sort of tipping point.
[2228.4s] Again, for a couple of months, I've been feeling the inevitability—kind of based, even though parts of me don’t like it—on the institutional buy-in.
[2238.7s] It's gotten to the point where I think they don't just roll it back like they did last time.
[2245.5s] Customers are demanding it.
[2250.5s] People who said they'd never custody crypto just, like, stood it up quickly.
[2254.5s] And, you know, it's probably too intermingled now to really remove. If sentiment changes towards crypto in the U.S. and elsewhere—
[2270.3s] then there's a lot of thinking to do about
[2273.5s] what, you know, completing the product, so to speak. Like, it's a strange thing in which retail was in for a while,
[2285.6s] and maybe got burned—kind of culminating with FTX.
[2292.0s] It probably hasn't come back all that much, and the institutions are in now, which means that retail will eventually come back.
[2303.1s] And we cannot burn retail again. You know, like, it just has to be better. I think one of the things we think about is just the absolute experience—the totality—has to be better than whatever service it's displacing:
[2320.0s] FX exchanges, whatever. It's not all financial services, obviously, but a lot of them are.
[2325.2s] And this includes things like making sure people don't lose the keys somehow, or what have you.
[2331.8s] So there's like a needle to thread there.
[2333.5s] But I think that's going to be a lot of what the next phase is about.

SPEAKER_00:
[2339.3s] Bob, what do you think?

SPEAKER_02:
[2340.9s] Well, I mean, I think the way that that will happen for a lot of retail is that they're not going to have their hands on it directly.
[2347.7s] It will all be through these instruments.
[2350.0s] So their experience is just, "Oh yeah, I've got a brokerage account and there's those in it as well."
[2356.7s] But they kind of—they look indistinguishable from
[2359.9s] commodities or equities or bonds or anything else.
[2363.2s] It's just, "Yeah, here's some more financial instruments," and then you go.
[2366.1s] So I think that's your sort of speculative retail—crypto-as-an-investment people.

[2374.7s] What I think is going to be more interesting to watch is the payments side.
[2379.9s] Especially with the Stripe project there. You know, if you get to a place where lots of
[2389.9s] just regular payment flows can use crypto rather than fiat—
[2395.7s] that's really interesting. You can start getting real velocity of non-speculative use.
[2403.3s] Because everything really, at this point, has pretty much been speculation—or, you know, a little bit of payments, but not really any large volume of payments.
[2414.0s] Early on it was like, "Buy your coffee with Bitcoin!" And that didn't last very long, and that kind of hasn't really come back.
[2421.5s] But really, with the stablecoins and these large integrations—like PayPal as well—PayPal are doing things. Mastercard have announced stuff.
[2435.4s] I'm sure all of these payment rails are going to be joining in on the game.
[2441.9s] And that really changes things.

SPEAKER_00:
[2445.2s] Yeah.
[2445.8s] And one question—are we going to DevConnect?
[2449.9s] I know me and Bob have already bought our tickets.
[2452.5s] Kieran, you're the holdout.
[2453.6s] Can I get a commitment?

SPEAKER_01:
[2454.5s] I'm still a “probably.”
[2457.3s] For one, I've never been to Argentina.
[2459.8s] I really do want to go.

SPEAKER_00:
[2463.4s] I really want to see what's going on.
[2465.6s] Yeah, I haven't been to South America, and I really want to see what's happening in the crypto world over there.
[2470.9s] Because you hear a lot about it.
[2472.1s] Obviously, there are big exchanges and big projects there.
[2474.9s] So I'm just really curious to find out.

SPEAKER_01:
[2476.8s] Vitalik said he's more likely to get recognized in Buenos Aires than in the U.S.

[2496.6s] Bob, if they want to hear more from you, where can they find you?

SPEAKER_02:
[2500.0s] Yeah, so I'm just Bob Samuelsson with my name on Twitter.

SPEAKER_00:
[2506.4s] And Kieran, where can people find you?

SPEAKER_01:
[2508.2s] Um, @KJamesLubin—so shortened, but my name also—on Twitter/X.

SPEAKER_00:
[2517.7s] And you can find me at @Vic4Wong on Twitter.
[2521.0s] Um, Bob and Kieran have both shamed me publicly because I have so few followers, even though I was an early adopter.
[2527.8s] So please, please connect to me.
[2530.6s] Love to hear from you.

SPEAKER_02:
[2531.5s] What's the “4” about?
[2533.5s] What's the Vic four?

SPEAKER_00:
[2535.1s] Oh, so—
[2536.5s] four is a number that no Chinese person likes, because it sounds suspiciously like "death."
[2547.3s] So it's—you know, back in the world of eight-character usernames, I could always get Vic4Wong.
[2556.7s] Having an Asian name with the number four in it pretty much guaranteed that I could get it.

SPEAKER_01:
[2562.2s] Always doing things the Wong way.

SPEAKER_00:
[2564.0s] Exactly.
[2565.0s] I've never heard that joke before.
[2567.0s] Okay.
[2567.4s] Thank you, everyone.
[2568.2s] See you again next week.
[2570.6s] Take care.
[2571.1s] Cheers, guys.
