**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay.
We are live, and we have a very special episode today.
We are talking about the future of art and NFTs,
and we're joined by special guest and very old friend,
John Crain.
Welcome, John Crain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Hey, Victor.
Hey, everyone.
Hey.
Good to see you guys.
Thanks for having me.

**SPEAKER_00:**
John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare.
But do you wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, sure.
So yeah, let's see.
My crypto journey started in around 2015,
going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there.
Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology.
I worked in advertising.
I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad.
And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading.
And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art.
So yeah, I doubled down immediately.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Remember—

**SPEAKER_03:**
How you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally?
Obviously, we met there, but what was that—

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Well—

**SPEAKER_03:**
Your—yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So I was kind of hanging—
Okay, I was wrong.
Like, this is actually super cool.
I have no problem changing.
I was like, I was totally wrong.
This is amazing.
And I was just googling "Ethereum blockchain hackathon."
I was trying to find—like, get deeper involved.
I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto.
And so then I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks.
And I applied with Charles.
And then, yeah, met you guys.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. And to be clear, to let everyone know,
we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project,
and we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3, right?
We gave you the—

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Exactly.
I think the Monday after—
I don't know. I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.
I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I remember there was like a couple-week consulting—

**SPEAKER_03:**
Transition period while—

**SPEAKER_01:**
You know? Yeah. I think that's true.
Maybe it was like we started hourly, like, getting to know each other a little bit, and then full-time. So yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So with Counterparty, you could have been on—

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
If only.
So what inspired SuperRare?
Like, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations.
But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.
Well, I mean, it was super interesting, right?
We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there.
Watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating.
Me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens, and I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard—like, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code.
But the adoption created this massive wealth generation.
And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy.
It was incredible to see that happen.
And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and I saw the CryptoPunks launch.
And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy.
If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata.
So it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs.
I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large.
So that got me into NFTs.
And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs.
I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art.
And it just seemed obvious.
I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets,
and this is obviously going to apply to digital art.
So it was kind of like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.
