**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] You know, I started working on Ethereum before my time at Devcon one.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:03] Before your time at Devcon one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:05] Yeah. I was thinking about it and realized that I had an idea to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space before Devcon one.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:08] So, how did Devcon one impact you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] It was amazing. I sat through every talk from morning until the end of the day. The only time I missed a talk was when I had to catch my flight back home.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:15] What were some memorable moments or talks?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:17] There was a presentation on MakerDAO, which made me realize we could create stable coins. Fabian and Alex presented the ERC-20 token standard, which is now so integral to Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:25] Did you present anything at Devcon one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:27] Yes, we presented the Radar Network. We got a lot of positive feedback there.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:30] What was your impression of the event overall?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:32] It felt like the golden days. Everyone was focused on technology and inspired by new ideas. There were no side events or parties, just dinners together.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:40] How did Devcon one compare to later conferences?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:43] At Devcon two there was maybe a couple of parties and a bar. But at Devcon three in Cancun, it felt like there was a lot more money involved with many parties.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:50] How did the atmosphere change?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:53] It's been quite crazy to see how things have grown. Measuring by the number of events and parties at each Devcon, you can see how popular Ethereum has become.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:00] What was your favorite part about Devcon one?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:03] It was so inspiring and motivating. I got to know many people who are now important figures in the Ethereum community.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:10] Did you meet anyone interesting there?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:13] Recently, I found out that someone I met a couple of years ago was also at Devcon one. He didn't see many talks because he was trying to get the Geth client running on his machine.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:20] That's funny. It wasn't easy back then, even with developers nearby.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:23] Exactly. It took days just to get it working properly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:27] Thanks for sharing your memories of Devcon one.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:30] You're welcome. Great chatting with you always.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:33] All the best to you too.
