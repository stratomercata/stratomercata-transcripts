SPEAKER_01:
[0.9s] We are live.

SPEAKER_03:
[3.9s] Are we live?

SPEAKER_01:
[5.0s] We are live, yes.
[6.4s] So StreamYard says.

SPEAKER_03:
[10.1s] My window doesn't say live.

SPEAKER_00:
[13.9s] You guys have an intro you like to do?
[15.4s] Yeah, well, first.

SPEAKER_03:
[18.4s] Here we go.
[18.9s] Here we go.
[19.7s] Yeah, there we are.

SPEAKER_01:
[23.2s] Go ahead, Bob.

SPEAKER_03:
[25.1s] So hello, everybody.
[26.6s] I guess we're ready to go.
[30.3s] So today we have a special guest with us.
[35.2s] It’s the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here as an ex-BlockApps-er.

SPEAKER_00:
[47.6s] Yeah, ex-crypto-ex.

SPEAKER_01:
[50.1s] You are never an ex-BlockApps-er.
[52.0s] You're always like part of team BlockApps-er.

SPEAKER_02:
[54.4s] The alumni network.

SPEAKER_01:
[55.5s] Yes, exactly.

SPEAKER_00:
[57.7s] Yeah, yeah.
[58.3s] You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which—it feels like ages ago.
[64.8s] And I mean, it is ages ago.

SPEAKER_02:
[65.7s] Lifetime.
[66.8s] Yeah.

SPEAKER_00:
[68.1s] Yeah.
[68.2s] So thank you guys for that.
[69.3s] Happy to be on here.
[70.4s] It's always great seeing you guys around.
[72.0s] And so talking about one of my favorite topics.
[76.0s] Welcome.

SPEAKER_03:
[76.6s] So yeah.
[77.2s] So welcome back.
[78.4s] Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

SPEAKER_00:
[84.7s] Yeah, sure.
[87.2s] So
[88.3s] Brian Smokovich, bsmokes.eth on Twitter.
[92.8s] We're building PistachioFi.
[95.5s] It's a mobile-first neobank built entirely on crypto rails, meant to provide premium savings with premium security.
[105.6s] And the whole concept of better UX, right?
[109.9s] I will get to the question in a moment of, is UX the key to mainstream adoption?
[116.2s] But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think self-custody is really important to me, and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space.
[126.9s] But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible, right?
[131.0s] And so I just wanted to be the change that I wanted to see in the world, and so decided to just say screw it and build my own, you know, basically taught myself UI design in order to kind of begin this in the beginning.
[145.8s] And then built it—literally willing Pistachio into existence—and many, many, many, many, many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been, you know, publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building, and doing things in a way to just bring more people.

SPEAKER_03:
[176.9s] I see that the number you said was 18 versions in five months.

SPEAKER_00:
[184.6s] We've pushed out several since that tweet, probably at least three or four.
[190.7s] We ship a lot.
[192.8s] It's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong.
[198.7s] I'll be at a conference and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and like watch, and every little tap, right?
[205.8s] Like, oh, the focus is wrong.
[207.0s] Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this one certain instance, or the search is showing the wrong things, you know?
[212.6s] And so every little—that's kind of the thing about UX is you design something and then you build it, right?
[221.0s] And then of course it's going to be bugged.
[222.7s] Everything is always bugged, right?
[223.9s] And like we go through rigorous testing to do it.
[226.0s] But then when it goes onto somebody's very specific use case because they touch certain things in a certain way, and that's what triggered this one bug—or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone—it behaves in a certain way.
[241.2s] And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right?
[244.7s] They're going to press it.
[245.6s] They're going to press it, and then they don't press it.
[247.4s] And you're like, why?
[248.4s] Why did they not press the very clear call to action that I made?
[251.6s] And so it's just like, the only real way—you can track things through things like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer to see the UX flows—but you're going to miss all the little details of every single user interaction.
[266.7s] And so just being able to like watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big
[271.2s] portion of what I think makes our app more successful.

SPEAKER_02:
[275.5s] Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question.
[279.1s] So if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improved the UX on the legacy financial system.
[289.8s] Like it looks way better, it works, it's not nearly as much of a mess as the like Schwab interface or what have you.
[298.0s] And this worked significantly—maybe Robinhood's perhaps the best example.
[302.5s] But you know, I think
[304.2s] So maybe that's like the baseline expectation, but is that sort of like the totality of UX?
[309.4s] Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is like, there’s stuff that’s bleeding through that’s complicated or scary and all of that too.
[319.3s] And, you know, so what is your take?
[321.2s] Like, from my understanding, I think you guys are multi-chain, but like inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too, you know?
[329.6s] So like, how do you think about that?

SPEAKER_00:
[333.0s] There's a lot to fix.
[335.5s] I think you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of
[341.7s] FinTech generational UX/UI—of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way.
[348.3s] I really love Venmo as an example.
[350.2s] I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI—and that UI doesn’t necessarily matter so much.
[357.7s] Like the UI of Venmo is sort of even almost antiquated in a way, but the UX is done beautifully.
[365.4s] And the reason is because the user—they approach it from just like, instead of like a feature—it’s just a user problem.
[372.7s] Like what is the user problem?
[373.7s] It's like sending money, right?
[374.9s] You open the app, it's got this big send button, and it's just—it’s so simple to just like a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank.
[382.6s] And so they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is, right?
[391.9s] And so

[393.1s] With Web3 UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with traditional finance and FinTech.
[405.5s] And that’s—so it's like when it comes to Web3, for example, especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay, we have gas we have to worry about, we have token approvals we have to worry about, we have multi-chain which we have to worry about.
[418.5s] We have bundled transactions if there are multiple transactions, right?
[424.4s] And so luckily, all of these things are now—there are solutions for these, right?
[429.1s] Between things like ERC-4337 and ERC-7702, there are ways to implement Paymasters, there are ways to bundle transactions together, there's ways to do Zaps.
[438.4s] Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together.
[442.7s] It’s like PistachioFi—we do all of this, right?
[444.8s] We do it all together, all in one go.
[448.1s] One thing that we don't do, for example, is—maybe within Web3 gaming—there's this concept of session keys.
[454.4s] And it's like, oh, OK, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that gets written to the blockchain?
[462.4s] It's like no—you just do a session key.
[463.9s] You sign once as you sign in.
[465.5s] Basically, as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key that extends for that period of your gaming session.
[473.9s] And so that basically absorbs away—or abstracts away—that problem as well.
[478.1s] So there's a lot that it takes for like a Web3 company again to get to parity of all these things.
[484.7s] There are ways to solve it all.
[487.1s] It’s just a matter of like: Does the app creator understand all of these things?
[492.6s] Are they aware of all of these things?
[494.0s] Do they care enough to do all of these things, right?
[496.7s] Like some of the major apps or wallets—even like, I love—I’m a big Rabby user.
[502.0s] They still don’t have ERC-7702 implemented, right?
[504.6s] And so there’s a lot of these big players that still don’t have
[507.8s] these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.

SPEAKER_01:
[515.6s] I'm curious, Brian, because just to reveal some of the background—when you were working for us, you were like a sales guy.
[523.8s] How did you teach yourself about UX and product design?
[527.7s] I'm glad you've joined the dark side.
[529.9s] But it's like, what got you there?
[535.6s] What made you feel like, okay, this is something I can take?

SPEAKER_00:
[539.3s] Well, I've always honestly really loved the product side.
[543.9s] Like I think I had like a natural ability to be a salesperson.
[550.2s] Like I love to just chat and create rapport.
[553.1s] And I think that's very important for sales and marketing.
[556.3s] But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for—I think it was more of just a natural inclination to this sort of thing.
[566.3s] And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's like the natural calling, right?
[573.0s] Like when you find something that you really like,
[575.3s] you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it.
[579.1s] And then now suddenly I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days working on a website, or whatever it is, right?
[585.6s] Just because I'm like—I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it.
[590.6s] So like when I was learning UX/UI, it was like some courses that I would take and do that.
[596.5s] And then a lot of it was just trial and error.
[600.2s] And I think a big part of it was having my own thing.
[603.9s] And I'm sure Kieran can—
[605.7s] Or, I mean, I think all of you—both you guys can relate to this—is that once it’s yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just like working for someone.
[621.5s] Like when you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get equity options and a paycheck and that’s nice.
[629.8s] That’s not as much skin in the game as truly,
[634.6s] owning something and being aligned—like, okay, if I kill this, I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it, and it's my baby, right?
[644.4s] So I think that sort of shines a lot in being a founder and growing your own application.
[651.9s] And then it's just like, I have like an obsession with it, to be honest. I have an obsession with
[657.4s] talking to users and understanding what makes it better, and just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over, right?
[667.4s] And so I think all of that has just like aggregated and led me to where I am today.

SPEAKER_01:
[674.8s] And yeah, I mean, one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten the chance to work with some great people and we can always see that you have that sort of entrepreneurial spirit.
[685.0s] It's interesting that it's come out.
[686.8s] I think one challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure technical backgrounds is the ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong, or I don't understand this.
[701.1s] That seems to be a big hurdle that a lot of truly technical people just can't get over sometimes.

SPEAKER_00:
[707.8s] And it comes down to, which I think maybe makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as well, is that I say like UX is just empathy—just like brought to life.
[722.2s] Because at the end of the day, you very, very much need to just be able to put yourself in your user's shoes.
[729.3s] And to empathize with, oh, okay, this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated, which should frustrate you, right?
[737.4s] If it's gonna piss them off, it should piss you off that it's not good enough.
[741.3s] Because if you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that ability to also be frustrated, then you’re not going to care enough to fix it, right?
[750.8s] It’s like, you should be pissed.
[752.6s] If a user is going to be pissed, you should be pissed.

SPEAKER_01:
[756.1s] Yeah, I agree 100%.

SPEAKER_02:
[758.4s] Who do you see your target user as?
[762.8s] And I guess I mean, you know, there's like, there’s full-on normies, there's crypto natives, there’s—but the—you know, I’m sort of like interested in like age ranges and all that sort of thing.
[774.5s] Cause I think maybe both of us—but you know, it's like, it's hard to define exactly like the bucket. Like they probably are crypto-friendly, but maybe—you know, anyway.

SPEAKER_00:
[785.4s] We will be normie—we are normie-friendly.
[788.1s] Like if you want to invite your—I want to say your parents, but your dad's a bit, I think, beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto-native.
[798.7s] But when it comes to like, let's say like siblings and family, I want it to be friendly enough that you can invite these people without fear of throwing them to the wolves—
[806.8s] of volatility, of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls—all these things.
[813.3s] And so it’s designed with all of that in mind.
[815.7s] But really, my ideal user—my ideal customer—is probably between the ages of like 25 to 55,
[824.2s] that are crypto-inclined, that probably have been in crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on-chain, that want to be able to not need to off-board crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high-quality, self-custodial, high-security but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values security, but that also values privacy.
[854.1s] And that has the ability then to not let their funds—if they’re going to risk off into stables, for example—be able to easily earn safe, curated, high-quality yield that is at least double what is in U.S. Treasuries without being exposed to equities, and then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly.
[877.8s] And so that's sort of like—through just talking to a lot of people—seems to be the very bread and butter of people that I think would work very well, of like a customer user base of people who can at least put five figures into my app.

SPEAKER_00:
[892.6s] Preferably at least 50 grand into the six figures that would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism, because of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our users—to trust that as well. But also, if you want to invite your friends, your family, to make it easy just to get on-chain, this is the easiest way, right?

SPEAKER_01:
[918.6s] So, why do you think
[921.5s] the UX has been so bad in Web3 for so long?

SPEAKER_00:
[927.8s] I think it's a large disconnect between people building and people talking to users. Especially, I talk to a lot of founders.
[936.2s] I love to talk to founders.
[937.5s] I meet so many people—like, one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just sort of, in that natural BD aspect, I meet so many
[947.8s] people and hear about what they're building.
[950.1s] And very frequently, I'm asked to basically audit people's UX/UIs—just give feedback.
[958.6s] And I think a big part of what people build is, they build—
[962.7s] people want to build an MVP, they want to build fast, they want to build something.
[966.3s] And it’s a hard chicken-and-egg problem of, how do I talk to users when I don’t have anything for them to use, right?
[972.5s] Like, if I don't have an MVP, if I don't have these—and so people then build in this direction of, “Okay, well, I'm just going to build a product, and then I'm going to get users,” right?
[982.5s] And so realistically, what they want to do is—they should be building the product while also talking to potential users.
[991.3s] You want to talk to people who you think this problem is solving, right?
[995.4s] Because you shouldn't just be building an app or a feature set.
[998.4s] Again, you need to build to solve a problem.
[1001.4s] And so when you're building to solve that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like—
[1008.2s] I mean first, your friends, because they're just the most likely to give you help—
[1012.1s] and it's like, do any of you have this problem?
[1013.8s] Find friends who have this problem.
[1015.7s] If you don't, it's not necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this problem.
[1022.4s] And then if you go out and you don’t find people who have this problem,
[1026.0s] eventually, you're not solving a problem, right?
[1027.9s] You're creating a solution in search of a problem, instead of actually finding people who would be willing to test out what you're doing and then show them the earliest iterations, right?
[1040.3s] And so figuring that out—“Is this confusing?
[1043.5s] Is this good?
[1044.1s] Is this bad?”—
[1045.5s] Is this specific UX really actually solving the core problem that we set out to solve at the end of the day?
[1054.1s] Luckily, I think a lot of builders these days set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their earlier careers or usage of tech.
[1068.5s] Let's say you work at a B2B company or you're creating a company—maybe you're a founder—
[1073.1s] and you're like, “Dude, this is such a pain in my butt,” right?
[1076.1s] This one particular thing—they go on to create a company that goes to solve that problem.
[1081.1s] It's like they're dogfooding their own pain.
[1083.8s] Same thing with B2C. I love to use crypto and be on-chain and love trying all of these different apps.
[1091.4s] And that's what led me to where I am with creating, right?
[1096.4s] Because I would dogfood all of these apps essentially and just be like, “Okay, well, this isn't good enough.
[1101.1s] This isn't good enough.”
[1102.5s] And so I think that’s sort of the main reason creators or app builders—
[1107.5s] I think they maybe try to create something to be cool or to add vanity,
[1111.1s] or potentially to chase the trend—because they see, “Ah, this is where all the money’s going.”
[1117.3s] Like, people are chasing perps right now.
[1120.6s] How many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to go out and get money?
[1130.5s] For better or for worse, they try to chase that trend because they see that’s where VC money is flowing.
[1135.9s] And they say, “Oh, if I can get on that VC trend, then I can get the money to build this,” right?
[1140.1s] And they chase that trend, thinking maybe that’s the hot narrative everyone’s investing in.
[1144.4s] And so they’re getting pulled in all these different directions instead of really going back to the core: what problem do I want to solve?

SPEAKER_01:
[1152.1s] Yeah, I mean, my kind of theory—and one of the challenges Web3 has had—is that, you know, in the first phase of Web3, we were really just trying to solve technical problems, right? Like, make it work at all.
[1164.9s] And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to an extent.
[1169.9s] But—
[1172.0s] those people that can solve those super-hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can think like, “Oh, from a user perspective,” really, right?
[1181.6s] They’re thinking more about, “OK, how do we solve that technical problem?”
[1184.7s] And that’s really where I think the shift has kind of happened.
[1188.8s] And I think you've got it at the right time.

SPEAKER_00:
[1191.6s] I think there are a lot more engineers these days, too, that are more savvy in that way—towards design.
[1197.2s] More like hybrid engineers who have that backend/front— I mean, just full-stack, right?
[1202.4s] Who are now also intrigued by design, maybe because they built their own thing from scratch and were forced to.
[1211.4s] As opposed to just a straight-up backend engineer who’s doing their thing.

SPEAKER_02:
[1215.5s] One thing I'll say—I now code again occasionally because the AI has gotten so good.
[1220.9s] And if it has a template, it's not so good at UX from scratch.
[1225.1s] But if it has something to work from, I'm like, “No, just generate a component like this and do this.”
[1230.2s] And it usually gets it right within a couple of times.
[1234.0s] So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be.

SPEAKER_01:
[1239.5s] And I found with my Web2 startups and my mobile startups, one of the reasons—like, I was the CTO of the first startups, and then I switched to product—
[1250.6s] was because I realized that, hey, by turning step three into step one, I could 10x the usage overnight.
[1256.6s] So it's like that—but it's a totally different mode of thinking than, “Oh, how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things?”

SPEAKER_00:
[1265.0s] Also, the infrastructure really didn’t exist for a while.
[1268.3s] I remember vividly—we were at the BlockApps office and Vic, you said in the office, “Mobile Web3 sucks.”
[1280.4s] I just remember you going on about it.
[1282.8s] And it was true for such a long period of time.
[1285.9s] The infrastructure needed to basically bring Web3 to mobile didn’t exist for the longest time.
[1292.7s] And this last bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went into infrastructure.
[1298.9s] It’s still not good enough, but that’s fine.
[1302.1s] It’s always improving.
[1304.2s] But the fact is—
[1305.8s] a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn’t exist back then. Or even just libraries, right, of people having SDKs that are compatible with React Native or just native mobile languages—
[1318.6s] to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that.
[1324.9s] We can’t build everything from scratch, dude.
[1327.2s] As much as I would love to have everything in-house—especially being a mostly bootstrapped company—
[1333.0s] no, we need people to have proper— they need to have good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, hardened stuff that we can just take and use, and that we don’t have to bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate because it doesn’t work.

SPEAKER_00:
[1709.8s] Like, these are all the different vendors—for every different part of the stack, there's a different decision for a different vendor. And being able to basically understand Web3 deeply enough to understand the trade-offs of each vendor and what they bring, and, okay, well, what's the price? Because we're unfunded, right? So I have to make sure it works within the realm of my budget while also making sure it's scalable in the long term, if we—

[1736.2s] If we do go into this thing. And then how do we do things to be modular?

[1740.8s] Do we do things as a purely vertical stack?

[1743.6s] Does that lock us into a vendor?

[1745.0s] Do we want to be more modular?

[1747.3s] And then we’ve had opportunities.

[1748.6s] We've had moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performing well enough.

[1753.6s] They're not elite enough, you know?

[1755.1s] So removing them and upgrading whatever we had set us back in delivery time. It took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as literally a two-person team for the longest time.

[1768.6s] We just hired our second full-time engineer last month.

[1772.7s] But it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time.

[1775.8s] And thank God that I understand blockchain architecture as deeply as I do—or else all of this would have been on him.

[1785.0s] It made it much easier being able to share that experience.

SPEAKER_01:
[1789.5s] That's awesome.

[1792.8s] As you say, at every step, there's a new challenge.

[1796.2s] But I think it's also about being excited.

[1800.6s] You work really, really hard, as we can see.

[1803.7s] So I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project and just in general.

SPEAKER_03:
[1810.8s] Thank you.

[1811.1s] So yeah, I'm just looking at the time, Brian.

[1814.7s] So let me just ask you one last question, perhaps.

[1820.5s] When are we ready for the normies?

SPEAKER_00:
[1823.7s] We're already ready for the normies.

[1825.5s] At least Pistachio is, right?

[1829.0s] We made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy.

[1833.3s] You don't have to worry about seed phrases.

[1835.0s] You don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right?

[1838.5s] We can recover everything—

[1840.9s] —programmatic ways and secure ways as well that aren’t going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves.

[1850.3s] And the next wave of updates we’re going to be doing is going to be really cool, too.

[1856.6s] I think like—it’s just the ability to—essentially, the alpha is the ability to send bank transfers from an on-chain account to specific accounts all over the world for very, very cheap.

[1869.9s] So like, stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves real pain, right?

[1874.5s] It's like this idea of—going back to what I’ve been talking about—

[1880.5s] like crypto—and even to tie it all in—is better Web3 UX the key to mainstream adoption?

[1887.2s] And I don't think it is, right?

[1888.8s] It's like—better UX is the key to any app adoption.

[1894.4s] It's why we’ve seen Robinhood or whatever get big. But there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day.

[1902.3s] And if my ability to send an on-chain transaction—

[1907.3s] —and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a SPEI transfer from the U.S. to Mexico for only a dollar, that’s a significant pain being solved. Because most common applications right now that do it are, let’s say, Dollar App or Félix—and they do it for a $3 flat fee.

[1932.3s] Which is still pretty expensive, especially if you only want to send small amounts, right?

[1936.1s] Send $100, that’s a 3% fee—that's quite high.

[1942.2s] And so we can basically do it in a way with no limits, no caps. You can send $50,000—

[1949.6s] —for a dollar if you want to do it with banking rails. Or if you want to just keep it on-chain and keep it in Pistachio—

[1949.9s] —right?

[1955.1s] Right.

[1955.3s] It's free, unlimited—as we all know how you can send money in crypto land.

[1962.8s] You can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents. And on Pistachio, all the peer-to-peer transactions are free.

[1964.6s] So I think we're ready for normies right now.

[1967.7s] But it's just about increasing the amount of—

[1976.9s] —increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains.

[1979.1s] Painful.

[1980.3s] Expensive pains.

[1983.2s] That's the way to do it.

[1983.6s] Okay.

[1985.6s] Thank you very much.

[1988.3s] Thank you guys for having me.

[1990.5s] I know you got to run.

SPEAKER_02:
[1994.9s] At least some of us will be at some of the international events.

[1996.3s] Maybe we can catch up there.

SPEAKER_00:
[1997.1s] Yeah, perfect.

[2001.9s] Please—if you guys are going to ETH Latam in Brazil or DevConnect—I’ll be at both of them.

SPEAKER_01:
[2003.6s] We will definitely be there.

[2005.4s] Look forward to seeing you in person, man.

[2007.0s] And I want to see your talk.

[2009.1s] Share the details about your talk, man.

SPEAKER_00:
[2009.9s] Yeah, absolutely.

[2011.4s] Will do.

[2011.8s] Take care.

[2012.4s] Okay.

[2014.0s] Thanks so much.

[2014.6s] It was great to meet you, Bob.

[2016.4s] You too.

[2016.9s] Cheers.

[2017.3s] Bye-bye.
