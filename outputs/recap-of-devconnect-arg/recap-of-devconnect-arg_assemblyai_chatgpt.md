**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:02] We are on.
[00:03] And welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina.
[00:06] I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato3.
[00:10] Maybe I may be looking very robotic.
[00:12] So if I am, then yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:28] C3PO.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:31] So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off.
[00:35] Kieran, you want to go?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:36] Sure.
[00:37] I'm Kieran.
[00:38] I'm our CEO, I guess you know.
[00:40] Okay.
[00:41] So Strato, we have been—I guess we're hard announcing it now.
[00:45] We are the labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps, and I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet open source kind of foundation-given project.
[00:55] First we called that Strato Mercado because Mercado was sort of a separate product, and we've kind of purposefully sunset everything else.
[01:03] So going back to the OG Strato at this time.
[01:06] So I guess I'm the Strato CEO.
[01:08] Yeah, we're jumping in with two feet.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[01:23] Victory.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:24] Yeah, exactly.
[01:25] Well, I just—I was kind of soft-pedaling it, but I didn't know if you wanted to make the announcement there.
[01:29] That's cool.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:30] Well, but you said "of Strato," so it was too late.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:35] I think I've already changed it in my mind.
[01:37] So maybe it's not like...
[01:39] And thanks for that, Bob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:42] Yeah, that's it.
[01:43] OG OG.
[01:44] So Strato was, you know, unveiled at Devcon 1.
[01:47] I don't know what exact date that was.
[01:49] You know, it might be almost exactly 10 years, like right now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:59] I think it's very close to 10 years.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:00] I think it was early December, maybe a week off.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:03] No, no, I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold and it was in London, and I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal 31 minutes at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:16] So I will keep looking off to the side, but...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:18] Okay.
[02:19] You're our resident historian, Bob.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:22] I see a YouTube video—December 11, 2015.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:26] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:27] No, later though.
[02:28] They got released.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:29] Posted later.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:30] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31] So...
[02:32] Well, Bob, do you want to do a quick—who are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:36] So hi, I'm...
[02:37] I'm Head of Ecosystem.
[02:39] So yeah, joined the team this year.
[02:41] But you know, long-time friend.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:46] Yes.
[02:47] Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:49] Right.
[02:50] And Jim, who are you?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[02:53] I am James from SDR.
[02:55] I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:00] Yes, and of Strato too, as Kieran has announced.
[03:03] So let's dive right into it.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:07] We—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:08] What were your—I don't know, maybe I did.
[03:10] I stealth announced.
[03:11] I pushed over the edge of that one.
[03:13] Right.
[03:14] So let's dive into it.
[03:15] What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires?
[03:18] Who wants to start here?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:28] I guess I can.
[03:29] Quickly.
[03:30] Hopefully quickly.
[03:31] I know we all have a tendency to ramble.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:33] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:34] So one of my big surprises—let's say the city itself.
[03:37] I was surprised to find that I was in Europe.
[03:39] I was expecting to be in South America.
[03:41] And I guess everyone knows this—they call it like the Paris of South America or something.
[03:45] But quite beautiful place.
[03:47] The mix of food varied from really excellent—especially on the steak front, that is all true.
[03:52] If anyone is on the fence about the Argentinian steak, go and try it.
[03:56] You know, like medium sometimes.
[03:58] You know, service very slow.
[04:00] The city does not look that big.
[04:02] Like somehow, you know, all of the hotels near the venue were booked out.
[04:06] So I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car.
[04:09] And if there's no traffic, it was like 9 to 12 minutes away.
[04:12] But it was consistently about 25 minutes away because it's all kind of like mid-rises, like four to six or eight stories.
[04:18] And it's like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting.
[04:23] Yeah, it had like a little bit of an old-world feel.
[04:26] It's kind of narrow, but yeah, super cool.
[04:29] People are very nice.
[04:31] Maybe except for the slow service.
[04:33] It wasn't like snooty slow service, it was just slow service.
[04:36] You know, so hard to get things.
[04:38] You had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way.
[04:42] But would go back.
[04:43] Very cool place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:10] And what about DevConnect itself?
[05:12] How did you feel about the conference?
[05:14] And you know, you might want to mention like—yeah, what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:23] Well, tell you the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:27] Oh yeah.
[05:28] So as our resident historian of all things Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:35] Yeah, so it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation.
[05:38] There's actually two different conference series that run now.
[05:41] So Devcon, which was originally Developer Conference, obviously, has become not a developer conference anymore.
[05:47] I don't know when it was last a developer conference.
[05:50] Maybe Devcon 2-ish.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:53] Maybe.
[05:54] It kept getting bigger.
[05:55] Big but not huge.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:01] I'm thinking in terms of the content though, you know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:03] No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right?
[06:05] Like the more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:13] Well, I can't remember—at 2 they had Devcon and then like next to it they had like—I think it was called like World Blockchain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:22] Yeah, I mean that one was a combined event.
[06:24] Yeah.
[06:25] I guess probably Devcon 3, probably in 2017, was the switch over where you had like a thousand people.
[06:30] So it switched from a, you know, meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on, to more of a, you know, hey, here are the big talks.
[06:38] But yeah, we're on to—we have seven now.
[06:41] So, you know, Devcon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think.
[06:46] But yeah, they started doing DevConnects as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference—to be a collection of different events connecting, you know, developers and community.
[06:56] So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't.
[07:00] But it did have a different flavor to Devcon in that it was lots of little things.
[07:05] You know, lots of mini-events, many under that same banner—obviously side events as well.
[07:10] But even if you just got a ticket for the main thing with a theme of World Fair, you know, of really bringing people from around the world to show what they're working on.
[07:19] But I didn't expect it to be as big.
[07:21] Like, I think it probably was as big as Devcon really in the numbers.
