**SPEAKER_00:**
Woo.
We are on, and welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina.
I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Three CPO?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Three CPO, maybe. Three Three PO. I may be looking very robotic. So if I am, then, you know, like, yes.

**SPEAKER_02:**
C-3PM.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off. Kieran, you wanna go?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm Kieran. I'm our CEO. I guess, you know, okay. So Strato, we have been—I guess we're hard announcing it now.
We are—Cup the Labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps, and I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet, open-source kind of foundation-given project.
First, we called that Strato Mercado, because Mercado was sort of a separate product, and we've kind of purposely sunset everything else.
So going back to the OG Strato at this time. So I guess I'm the woo. Now does Strato have a CEO?

**SPEAKER_00:**
You know, we're jumping in with two feet, Victor.
Yes. Exactly. Well, I just—I was kinda soft-pedaling it, but I didn't know if you wanted to make the announcement there.
That's cool. Well, but you said "of Strato," so it was too late. I think I've already changed it in my mind. So maybe it's not like—and thanks for that, Bob.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. And that's it. OG OG. So Strato was, you know, unveiled at DevCon One.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know what exact date that—you know, it might be almost exactly ten years, like, right now. It's very close to ten.
I think it was early December, maybe a week off. No? No. No. I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold—it was in London.
And I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal during London at that time. So I will keep looking off to the side, but you're our resident historian, Bob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Continue there. On the—see a YouTube video—12/11/2015.

**SPEAKER_02:**
No, there's—yeah. No. Later. They got released later.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So, well, Bob, do you wanna do a quick "who are you"?

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm head of ecosystem. So, you know, joined the team this year, but, you know, long-time friend.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Right? Yes. And Jim, who are you?

**SPEAKER_03:**
I am James. I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes. And of Strato too, as Kieran has announced. So let's dive right into it.
What were your—when you announced—I don't know what—maybe I soft-announced.
I pushed you over the edge on that one. Right? So let's dive into it.
What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires?
Who wants to start here?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I guess I can quickly. Hopefully quickly. I know we all have a tendency to ramble. Yes.
Well, one of my big surprises—let's say the city itself.
I was surprised to find that I was in Europe. I was expecting to be in South America.
And I guess everyone knows this—they call it, like, the Paris of South America or something.
But quite beautiful place. The mix of, like, the food varied from really excellent—especially on the steak front.
That is all true. If anyone is on the fence about the Argentinian steak, go and try it.
To, you know, like, medium sometimes. You know, service very slow.
The city does not look that big. Like, somehow, you know, all of the hotels near the venue were booked out.
So I ended up staying about twenty minutes away by car. And if there's no traffic, it was, like, nine to twelve minutes away.
But it was consistently about twenty-five minutes away. It's all kind of mid-rises.
It's like four to six or eight stories, and it's like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting.
Yeah. It had, like, a little bit of an old-world feel. It was kinda narrow.
But yeah, super cool. People are very nice—maybe except for the slow service.
It wasn't like snooty slow service. It was just slow service.
You know? It's hard to get things—you had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way.
But would go back. Very cool place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And what about DevConnect itself? How did you feel about the conference?
And, you know, you might wanna mention, like, what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself?
Like, what—well, the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is.
Oh, yeah. So as a resident historian of all things Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. So it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation.
There's actually two different conference series that run now.
So DevCon, which was originally "developer conference," obviously, has become not a developer conference anymore.
I don't know when it was last a developer conference. Maybe DevCon 2-ish.
Maybe. I think it—getting bigger. Two was big, but not huge.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm thinking in terms of the content, though. You know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
No, I know. But they kinda correlated, right? Like, the more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, I kind of remember at 2, they had DevCon, and then, like, next to it, they had—I think it was called, like, World Blockchain.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. I mean, that one was a combined event. Yeah. I guess probably DevCon 3, probably in 2017, was the switchover.
Where you had, like, a thousand people. So it switched from a, you know, meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on to more of a, you know, hey, here are the big talks and, you know, woo.
But yeah, we're on to—we have seven now. So DevCon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think.
But yeah, they started doing DevConnect as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference—to be a collection of different events connecting, you know, developers and community.
So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't.
But it did have a different flavor to DevCon in that it was lots of little things—lots of mini-events under that same banner.
Obviously, side events as well, but even if you just got a ticket for the main thing with a theme of "World Fair," you know, of really bringing people from around the world to show what they're working on.
But I didn't expect it to be as big. Like, I think it probably was as big as DevCon really in the numbers.
I mean, effectively, I think they've become the same. Like, it's just, you know, basically...
