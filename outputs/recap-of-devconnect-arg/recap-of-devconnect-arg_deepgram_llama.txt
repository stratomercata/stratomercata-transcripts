**SPEAKER_00:**
[1.0s] Woo.
[2.2s] We are on, and welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina.
[6.6s] I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato.
[10.7s] Three CPO? Maybe. Three three PO. I may be looking very robotic. So if I am, then, you know, like yes.
[26.5s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28.1s] See, 3PM.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[31.8s] So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off. Kieran, you wanna go? Sure.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[38.1s] I'm Kieran. I'm our CEO. I guess, you know, okay. So Strato, we have been, I guess, we're hard announcing it now. We are, cup the labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps, and I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet open source kind of foundation given given project.
[59.1s] First, we call that Strato Mercado, because kind of Mercado was sort of a separate product, and we've kind of purposely sunset everything else. So going back to the OG Strato at this time. So I guess I'm the woo. Now does Strato have a CEO? Like, we're jumping in with two feet, Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[81.2s] Yes. Exactly. Well, I just I was kinda soft pedaling it, but I didn't know if you want to make the announcement there. That's cool. Well, I but you said of Strato, so it was too late. That's how we I think I've already changed it in my mind. So maybe it's not like and and thanks for that, Bob.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[102.2s] Yeah. And that's it. O g o g. So, Strato was, you know, unveiled at DevCon one. I I don't know what exact date that you know, it might be almost exactly ten years, like, right now. It's very close to ten I think it was early December, maybe a week off. No? No. No. It's not even I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold in it was in London.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[114.6s] I I found what was kind of strange was that you signed up for these, like, large blocks of time, and then you wouldn't the agenda wouldn't be clear when you were signing up. Right? And then you might, like, see one good talk in that you know? Like, some of them lasted, like, nine till five. And people were just hanging out, like, coworking and having coffee and whatever for most of it, and the talks were, like, in this tight segment that they didn't name until, like, much later.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[129.8s] I liked a bunch of the main stage talks. There were a few good ones on the Friday. There were good opening ones, and then there was a little amphitheater that had some of the good, like, DeFi app talks that but it it I agree it was sort of like a crapshoot. Like, the registration procedures sometimes you had to register for an event that was inside the venue. Sometimes that wouldn't work, but you would go, like, by the booth or whatever, and they would just tell you, like, oh, yeah. Just don't worry. Just show up. You know? And it so, like, it contributed to an impression of, like, never quite knowing like, agendas weren't really posted for any of these side events. They were not even really posted for the main event until, like, the night before. Like, they were kind of, you know, lazily, I mean, in the computer science sense, updating, the the agendas as you as you went, so to speak.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[146.2s] Yeah. So, I mean, talking about where we went, I was mainly just in the main venue with the exception of the day before the main event. Where we had the second Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, which is a good fun event. And the other thing that that there was on the final day was the Ethereum privacy stack event. So both of them were organized by Web three privacy now. The second one in collaboration with the privacy guys at the Ethereum Foundation.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[149.4s] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna jump in quickly on the congress. I wanna hate a little bit first. I saw the Infinite Garden appear on the screen again. Like, At DevConnect, you mean? Sorry. No. No. I'm a tech from congress. I'm not sure you saw that one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I took a picture of it for the for the record. Put it in the show notes.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[161.9s] Yeah. I mean, I don't know. You can't really tell when the thing's coming up. I'm not worried, really. Like, it's like everyone's talking about it, so it'll be fine. Also worth saying, though, I think, is that many parts of the world are not so progressive as The US on that sort of matter. Yeah. Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[170.9s] Well, I think the hot I mean, the other thing in between those two things is. So maybe we can I mean, Bob, I know you have some thoughts on that? Maybe we can start with you this time.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[175.9s] Yeah. So, I mean, talking about where we went, I was mainly just in the main venue with the exception of the day before the main event. Where we had the second Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, which is a good fun event. And the other thing that that there was on the final day was the Ethereum privacy stack event. So both of them were organized by Web three privacy now. The second one in collaboration with the privacy guys at the Ethereum Foundation.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[188.2s] I guess I can quickly. Hopefully, quickly. I know we all have a tendency to ramble. Yes. Well, one of my big surprises let's say the city itself. I was surprised to find that I was in Europe. I was expecting to be in South America. And I guess everyone knows this. They call it, like, the the Paris of South America or something, but quite beautiful place.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[208.5s] I I'll pass this to the Kieran.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[210.3s] Oh, okay. So I will say that both Jim and I have a physics background, but mine was more from, like, the math side where we're, like, good at the beauty of the equations, but, like, don't necessarily have an as an intuitive sense of, like, the physics people were good at, like, estimating the answer and then, like, back working into the actuality of it, where the the math people might have actually been better at the math side, though the physicists are quite good at it, but less so.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[216.9s] Yeah. I mean, I don't know. You can't really tell when the thing's coming up. I'm not worried, really. Like, it's like everyone's talking about it, so it'll be fine.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[220.0s] Yeah. I mean, on that kind of, like I I would not to push back against what you're saying, but, like, I do think the side, the privacy people have kind of gotten more customer aligned than purely philosophical aligned. Like, in the Ethereum Privacy Summit, I heard many times, like, yes. We want consumer privacy. No. We don't want to support North Korea or pedophiles.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[230.6s] Like, you know, it's like, I think it's Well, okay. There's a debate. Bob, do you wanna jump in? I ran into a mean during the conference who seems to have created this debate. He might have more context on it than, you know, than I do, but I'll I'll backfill if need be.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[238.6s] Yeah. Sure. So, I mean, specifically there, you have this philosophical question of if you do have a, you know, a privacy tech, should that be, unconditionally, you know, single anonymity set with the whole world? You know, do obviously, the larger anonymity set that you have, the better security you have with the ideal being it's everything.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[247.6s] So let me add maybe the flip side argument, but also so I'm never a user of any of these technologies. I'm sure I will test some at de minimis amounts at some some point. Tornado Cache, terrible name. You know, I I think the I believe that it actually also contained a capability at least to prove source of funds on one side.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[256.4s] But but talking to Zach, it seemed the primary motivation wasn't so much as of being compliant as it was we don't want any more of our friends to go to jail. Totally. Yeah. I guess. And maybe that's a passing phase?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[264.5s] It's that these yes. At the same time, I don't really know what the tornado cache people did other than build software. Could have been more than building the software. You know? There's no way that building some software, like, should count as, like, a conspiracy to launder some money.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[274.3s] Also worth saying, though, I think, is that many parts of the world are not so progressive as The US on that sort of matter. Yeah. Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[283.5s] Well, I'm Jim, I I think we're starting to get you know, we're a little bit over thirty minutes. Wanted to kind of touch base with you. I know you're still pretty jet lagged on, what were your impressions at the conference, especially since you attended a lot of agentic AI talks too? So, you know, how real is that? What do you think about whether whether what were your big takeaways from the conference?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[294.1s] Well, I I was pretty excited to go to to anything AI. But I I don't know. We're sort of like in in the the hype part of the hype cycle right now. And I went to on the first day to to one where multiple I don't know. It was, like, typical people up speaking would be, like, some somebody who had, like, put together a company where they were using AI to, you know, maybe go into DeFi trading or something like that.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[305.8s] Did you say anything with post apps? Any kind of post apps sort of, like, hey. Look. We've you can just AI drive this and, you know, that kind of text or voice interface as opposed to UI?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[314.1s] Well, I guess I guess there is a subtle distinction between, like like, an agent and, a helper or just like a a using AI as the UI. And as as a, like, an autonomous agent, that's the stuff that seems not quite baked to me yet.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[323.9s] Well, I'm Victor Wong. You can find me at x@vic4wong, w o n g. Karen, where can we find you? K. James on x and most places. Jim?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[332.1s] Still Twitter and I've I also forgotten my handle again. I should probably you should remind me next time to look it up. It's what was it? Or something?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[339.3s] I I may not I

**SPEAKER_01:**
[341.3s] looked it up, but I can't it was, like, two weeks ago. Okay. I'm gonna keep asking you.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[346.3s] It you're good. This is a pop weekly pop quiz for you, Jim. So you better learn it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
