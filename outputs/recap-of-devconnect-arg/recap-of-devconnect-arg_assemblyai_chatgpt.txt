**SPEAKER_00:**
We are on.
And welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina.
I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato3.
Maybe I may be looking very robotic.
So if I am, then yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
C3PO.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off.
Kieran, you want to go?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Sure.
I'm Kieran.
I'm our CEO, I guess you know.
Okay.
So Strato, we have been—I guess we're hard announcing it now.
We are the labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps, and I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet open source kind of foundation-given project.
First we called that Strato Mercado because Mercado was sort of a separate product, and we've kind of purposefully sunset everything else.
So going back to the OG Strato at this time.
So I guess I'm the Strato CEO.
Yeah, we're jumping in with two feet.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Victory.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly.
Well, I just—I was kind of soft-pedaling it, but I didn't know if you wanted to make the announcement there.
That's cool.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, but you said "of Strato," so it was too late.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think I've already changed it in my mind.
So maybe it's not like...
And thanks for that, Bob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that's it.
OG OG.
So Strato was, you know, unveiled at Devcon 1.
I don't know what exact date that was.
You know, it might be almost exactly 10 years, like right now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I think it's very close to 10 years.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I think it was early December, maybe a week off.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, no, I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold and it was in London, and I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal 31 minutes at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So I will keep looking off to the side, but...

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay.
You're our resident historian, Bob.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I see a YouTube video—December 11, 2015.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
No, later though.
They got released.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Posted later.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So...
Well, Bob, do you want to do a quick—who are you?

**SPEAKER_01:**
So hi, I'm...
I'm Head of Ecosystem.
So yeah, joined the team this year.
But you know, long-time friend.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes.
Long-time listener, first-time caller.
Right.
And Jim, who are you?

**SPEAKER_03:**
I am James from SDR.
I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes, and of Strato too, as Kieran has announced.
So let's dive right into it.

**SPEAKER_03:**
We—

**SPEAKER_00:**
What were your—I don't know, maybe I did.
I stealth announced.
I pushed over the edge of that one.
Right.
So let's dive into it.
What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires?
Who wants to start here?

**SPEAKER_02:**
I guess I can.
Quickly.
Hopefully quickly.
I know we all have a tendency to ramble.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So one of my big surprises—let's say the city itself.
I was surprised to find that I was in Europe.
I was expecting to be in South America.
And I guess everyone knows this—they call it like the Paris of South America or something.
But quite beautiful place.
The mix of food varied from really excellent—especially on the steak front, that is all true.
If anyone is on the fence about the Argentinian steak, go and try it.
You know, like medium sometimes.
You know, service very slow.
The city does not look that big.
Like somehow, you know, all of the hotels near the venue were booked out.
So I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car.
And if there's no traffic, it was like 9 to 12 minutes away.
But it was consistently about 25 minutes away because it's all kind of like mid-rises, like four to six or eight stories.
And it's like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting.
Yeah, it had like a little bit of an old-world feel.
It's kind of narrow, but yeah, super cool.
People are very nice.
Maybe except for the slow service.
It wasn't like snooty slow service, it was just slow service.
You know, so hard to get things.
You had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way.
But would go back.
Very cool place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And what about DevConnect itself?
How did you feel about the conference?
And you know, you might want to mention like—yeah, what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, tell you the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Oh yeah.
So as our resident historian of all things Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, so it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation.
There's actually two different conference series that run now.
So Devcon, which was originally Developer Conference, obviously, has become not a developer conference anymore.
I don't know when it was last a developer conference.
Maybe Devcon 2-ish.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Maybe.
It kept getting bigger.
Big but not huge.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I'm thinking in terms of the content though, you know?

**SPEAKER_02:**
No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right?
Like the more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, I can't remember—at 2 they had Devcon and then like next to it they had like—I think it was called like World Blockchain.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, I mean that one was a combined event.
Yeah.
I guess probably Devcon 3, probably in 2017, was the switch over where you had like a thousand people.
So it switched from a, you know, meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on, to more of a, you know, hey, here are the big talks.
But yeah, we're on to—we have seven now.
So, you know, Devcon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think.
But yeah, they started doing DevConnects as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference—to be a collection of different events connecting, you know, developers and community.
So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't.
But it did have a different flavor to Devcon in that it was lots of little things.
You know, lots of mini-events, many under that same banner—obviously side events as well.
But even if you just got a ticket for the main thing with a theme of World Fair, you know, of really bringing people from around the world to show what they're working on.
But I didn't expect it to be as big.
Like, I think it probably was as big as Devcon really in the numbers.
