**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Okay, welcome everyone.
[00:03] We have a very special topic today.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:05] I've never been good at sitting still on a chair for a long period of time.
[00:08] But there I was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end.
[00:13] I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my flight to go back on the last day.
[00:17] But I was just sitting there and sucking up all of these ideas and visions.
[00:21] And it was really...
[00:23] I think before that I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space.
[00:29] But after DEF CON 1, I was like, I have to do this.
[00:33] There's no other way for me.
[00:35] I'm not going back to the university.
[00:37] I'm not going to do anything else.
[00:40] This is what I'm going to do.
[00:42] Because it was a full day, or three full days, of just sitting there and people presenting their ideas.
[00:48] I remember clearly Maker was presented.
[00:51] I was like, OK, we can do stablecoins.
[00:54] Amazing.
[00:56] I think Fabian Vogelsteller and Alex Van Assande and some other people presented the ERC20 token standard or the early version of it, which, yeah, OK, this is such a big part of Ethereum now.
[01:03] I think maybe Gnosis, I'm not sure actually.
[01:06] And of course the project I was working on, the people there, we were presenting the Raiden network, which got a lot of very good feedback as well.
[01:12] So it was so interesting.
[01:14] And Hydrochain as well, right?
[01:16] Yeah, I was not so sold on Hydrochain back then because it was aimed at...
[01:20] One of the very first permissioned Ethereum.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:23] It was just about the technology.
[01:25] I think maybe there were three booths or something like that that just had a couple of stickers.
[01:29] I barely remember.
[01:31] I just remember it was an app.
[01:33] What was the name of the Haskell project?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:35] Block App Strato.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:37] Yeah, I remember they had like a small booth i think right right some stickers uh yeah very sad that i lost that sticker right but uh um other than that it was just like yeah just people there was one stage and everyone was like in the same room uh more yes um and in the evenings yeah people would go out go out for dinner maybe but there was not a single side event
[02:15] There was not a single party.
[02:17] Glory days.
[02:19] It was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's pies somewhere.
[02:23] Right.
[02:24] And that was kind of fun.
[02:26] You got to know people really, really well.
[02:28] It was really just the golden days, I felt like.
[02:31] There were so many inspired people and ideas, and people only talked about tech.
[02:35] I think there was like one...
[02:37] a little bit weird product, hype talk with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage, this like Free My Vunk, who had like a very different energy than everybody else.
[02:43] It felt like he was the only one who actually knew how to give a talk and how to actually sell.
[02:47] And back then I thought it was way too much, but now it's basically what everyone else is doing.
[02:51] And the quality of slides was so bad as well.
[02:53] It's funny to look back.
[02:55] But yeah, I was thinking about that and then I was comparing with, let's say, DEF CON 2.
[02:59] Right.
[03:01] I think at DEF CON 2 there was maybe like
[03:04] A couple of parties, I think ConsenSys had like a bar somewhere where we would usually go.
[03:08] It was still not that big.
[03:10] There was still only one stage, I think, at DEF CON 2.
[03:14] Yeah, quite doable.
[03:16] And then I think at DEF CON 3 in Cancun, that was where you could really feel, okay, now there's a lot of money in this space because there were parties right and left.
[03:25] And yeah, okay, the rest is history, right?
[03:27] That's right.
[03:29] It's been quite crazy to see this development as well of like
[03:33] measuring on the amount of events and parties at the different DEF CONs, how popular things got.
[03:41] But for me, the DEF CON one is like,
[03:43] one of my best memories of these 10 years, simply because it was just so inspiring and motivating, I would say.
[03:50] And a lot of the people you have on your list were around there.
[03:52] It's quite cool.
[03:54] And I actually recently found out that someone I got to know
[03:56] or a couple of years ago only, who's also doing some cool stuff.
[03:59] He actually was around there.
[04:01] We didn't meet each other.
[04:03] I only found out like two years ago, but he had also, and he said he didn't see almost any talks because he was sitting in the back trying to get
[04:08] or the guest client to run on his machine or something like that because it was not easy back then.
[04:13] Even if you had the devs available right next to you, it wasn't easy.
[04:16] So yeah, I think that's mainly what I have to share without going into too much detail about things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:20] Well, thanks so much.
[04:22] You're very welcome.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:23] Thank you.
[04:25] You too.
