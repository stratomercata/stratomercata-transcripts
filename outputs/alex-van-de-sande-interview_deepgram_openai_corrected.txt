[150.8s] SPEAKER_00: What's going on, everybody?
[152.7s] SPEAKER_01: Alex, I sent you an invite to speak
[156.6s] SPEAKER_01: and cohost.
[167.5s] SPEAKER_00: If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
[180.0s] SPEAKER_00: Good to see the faces piling in.
[182.9s] SPEAKER_00: Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
[195.5s] SPEAKER_00: Here. There we go.
[199.7s] SPEAKER_00: Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.
[212.0s] SPEAKER_00: If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions,
[217.0s] SPEAKER_01: just feel free to raise your hand.
[236.5s] SPEAKER_01: Kinda.
[240.6s] SPEAKER_01: Kinda a bit, like, underwatery.
[278.9s] SPEAKER_00: Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay.
[282.4s] SPEAKER_00: Let me see.
[296.1s] SPEAKER_00: Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience.
[322.5s] SPEAKER_00: Technology.
[331.9s] SPEAKER_00: Cartoons, you wanna come up?
[336.9s] SPEAKER_00: I'll invite you.
[338.6s] SPEAKER_00: Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak.
[344.6s] SPEAKER_00: You are here for episode zero, so...
[379.8s] SPEAKER_00: About you.
[381.5s] SPEAKER_00: Got you, Mac.
[403.0s] SPEAKER_00: Wish that my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.
[416.0s] SPEAKER_02: You should sing, AG.
[420.4s] SPEAKER_00: Who said that? Alex? Hey.
[423.5s] SPEAKER_02: Hey. You should you should play some live music.
[427.6s] SPEAKER_01: I I I was playing some classical music, but,
[432.0s] SPEAKER_01: yeah. No. It's it's good to have you on here. I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on.
[439.3s] SPEAKER_01: It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[443.4s] SPEAKER_01: So, really, I just wanna kinda just pick your brain a bit about about the past, honestly. Like,
[449.8s] SPEAKER_01: more than just, you know, Mistcoin
[451.9s] SPEAKER_01: in general, but really just, like,
[454.3s] SPEAKER_01: how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot. So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum, and what was your
[464.0s] SPEAKER_01: kind of first initial reaction to it?
[468.6s] SPEAKER_02: Sure. I I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists
[477.0s] SPEAKER_02: now.
[478.2s] SPEAKER_02: So I find it I find it funny. A little bit weird, but it's it's fun.

[484.3s] SPEAKER_02: So,
[486.2s] SPEAKER_02: I I think so I started
[489.2s] SPEAKER_02: being interested in the Bitcoin space around 2012.
[494.1s] SPEAKER_02: So that was
[496.0s] SPEAKER_02: in, like, it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I I already felt like, oh god, I missed it. They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on live TV.

[508.9s] SPEAKER_02: I was like, oh no. But, like, it it used to be under a dollar. Now it's, like, $10.
[514.8s] SPEAKER_02: Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right? That's too bad.
[518.8s] SPEAKER_02: I I even remember, like, I posted something on the forums saying, oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at five dollars. I paid.
[526.0s] SPEAKER_02: It was so hard.
[527.8s] SPEAKER_02: And then someone simply, like, I think,
[530.3s] SPEAKER_02: tipped me, like, 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, hey, here's
[534.8s] SPEAKER_02: here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin. And it was, like, back then, I don't know,
[541.6s] SPEAKER_02: like, probably a full Bitcoin. Right?
[545.4s] SPEAKER_02: So, like, Bitcoin was $5
[547.4s] SPEAKER_02: back then. So that was that that was those early days. Uh-huh.
[553.8s] SPEAKER_02: Again,
[554.7s] SPEAKER_02: didn't feel too early.

[557.4s] SPEAKER_02: And then
[558.8s] SPEAKER_02: I started paying attention
[560.7s] SPEAKER_02: because I felt that I knew something bigger would come,
[565.7s] SPEAKER_02: for Bitcoin.
[566.9s] SPEAKER_02: And I just started following all sorts of projects, like, Colored Coins,
[572.6s] SPEAKER_02: Mastercoin, and things like that. Uh-huh. And so I found Ethereum. And I was, wow, I was so blown away and captivated
[581.0s] SPEAKER_02: that I couldn't think of anything else. And the
[585.2s] SPEAKER_02: people were still very active on the Reddit. Like, Vitalik [Buterin] would answer
[590.3s] SPEAKER_02: questions personally.
[592.5s] SPEAKER_02: And then I just started helping out on the forum or on the Reddit.
[596.8s] SPEAKER_02: I'm I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, hey. Like, there are enough coders here. Maybe this is where they need a designer, and then someone would ask something for a presentation, and I could give them.

[608.8s] SPEAKER_02: And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started
[613.2s] SPEAKER_02: having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got
[620.0s] SPEAKER_02: started working with some crazy people.

[624.0s] SPEAKER_01: So you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved
[627.6s] SPEAKER_01: and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of
[631.2s] SPEAKER_01: jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.
[638.2s] SPEAKER_02: I certainly didn't expect it to, like—
[641.0s] SPEAKER_02: sort of yes and no because I felt it back then.
[645.0s] SPEAKER_02: It was it seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing, and I was like, I'm—I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this. I was like, can't— I felt like telling everybody I knew, "Can't you see? Look at this. This is crazy. It's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside," and people were, like...
[667.0s] SPEAKER_02: thinking, like, I was acting crazy or something.

[1178.5s] SPEAKER_02: Where does the idea of making tokens
[1181.7s] SPEAKER_02: come?
[1182.6s] SPEAKER_02: Well,
[1183.5s] SPEAKER_02: that has always been there. In fact,
[1187.1s] SPEAKER_02: the first use
[1188.8s] SPEAKER_02: of,
[1190.1s] SPEAKER_02: like, I think one of the things that is in the white paper,
[1194.8s] SPEAKER_02: one of the first things in the white paper, is it can be used to create tokens.
[1201.1s] SPEAKER_02: And that became obvious because what was happening back then, it was Bitcoin. And then whenever someone wanted to launch
[1209.1s] SPEAKER_02: and invent a new thing to build on top of it, they would launch a whole new token. Mhmm. So they were like, “Oh, I wanna do this blockchain thing, but I wanna use it
[1218.6s] SPEAKER_02: for storing names.”
[1220.3s] SPEAKER_02: And then they launched a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin. Yep. And then someone else thought, “Oh, you know what? We should have property
[1228.7s] SPEAKER_02: assets inside here.”
[1230.5s] SPEAKER_02: And then they launched Colored Coins, which were a whole new thing. They tried to do it on—at some point, it was on top of Bitcoin,
[1238.5s] SPEAKER_02: then it wasn’t.
[1239.9s] SPEAKER_02: And then someone
[1241.5s] SPEAKER_02: started doing—it, and then Mastercoin was like, “Oh, no. I think what we should do is that we should have
[1248.5s] SPEAKER_02: an exchange inside. So you can send the coin or ask for an exchange or send the token.”
[1255.4s] SPEAKER_02: And, basically, every time anyone wanted to do something new, they had to make a new opcode for Mastercoin.
[1263.8s] SPEAKER_02: And Vitalik [Buterin] was working with Mastercoin and Colored Coins back then. And that’s when he started to realize that's very inefficient—the idea that you have to either release a whole new blockchain whenever
[1275.4s] SPEAKER_02: someone else thinks about a new feature
[1278.1s] SPEAKER_02: or that you need to, like, create a whole new
[1281.7s] SPEAKER_02: upgrade to
[1283.6s] SPEAKER_02: your blockchain.

[1284.9s] SPEAKER_02: So—

[1288.7s] SPEAKER_01: I'm—

[1292.7s] SPEAKER_01: I think you might have dropped there.

[1296.3s] SPEAKER_01: Can’t hear you.

[1298.0s] SPEAKER_01: Is it just me, Mac? Can you hear him?

[1300.5s] SPEAKER_02: No. That’s—

[1407.7s] SPEAKER_01: Alright. Let’s see.

[1409.6s] SPEAKER_01: Alright. Good. I'm—I'm back here. Alright. Awesome.

[1413.7s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So—

[1415.0s] SPEAKER_01: I don’t even know where you left off.

[1417.8s] SPEAKER_02: I was talking about tokens.

[1419.3s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, talking about tokens. Yeah.

[1423.3s] SPEAKER_02: Am I the only one who couldn’t
[1425.3s] SPEAKER_01: who couldn’t understand anything that Mac said because he was very distorted? Or—yeah. He was a bit distorted. I don’t know what’s going on with that.

[1434.0s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

[1437.9s] SPEAKER_01: Okay.

[1438.8s] SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, so you were talking about,
[1441.4s] SPEAKER_01: like, you know, Mastercoin
[1443.3s] SPEAKER_01: and those types
[1444.7s] SPEAKER_01: of projects, and you had to, like, you know, release a whole
[1447.8s] SPEAKER_01: token and stuff. I was just—I was asking more about, like,
[1451.5s] SPEAKER_01: who decided to just, like,
[1454.9s] SPEAKER_02: play with the Mist token and just, like, “Oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit.” Like—well, that’s what I’m getting at. Right? So, we knew tokens were important. And then at some point, I posted, like, “Hey. We—we want to do a token
[1469.0s] SPEAKER_02: release on this.”

[2065.5s] SPEAKER_02: And I think those opportunities are always coming.
[2068.6s] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[2069.5s] SPEAKER_01: No. Yeah. I agree. And it's it's just about,
[2072.2s] SPEAKER_01: you know, building really at the end of the day and building in something you're passionate about. But regardless of the fact you're a pioneer,
[2079.0s] SPEAKER_01: a lot of people agree. So maybe you weren't going into that with the mindset of, hey, I'm a pioneer. You're just in there, you know, building,
[2086.7s] SPEAKER_01: you know, trying to do cool stuff as part of something that you think had a lot of potential.
[2090.8s] SPEAKER_01: And that, to me, is a definition of pioneer whether you had that mindset going into it or not. But I think we all appreciate you here and what you've done. But that that would be my suggestion, right? If anyone wants to,
[2106.6s] SPEAKER_02: like, if anyone wants to, like, own a part of history, the best way to do it is to invent it and to help write it. Right? I think that is the beauty part. So I really urge everyone who, like, loves to look back at history to also think that in twenty years, whatever you do now will be part of history. Right?
[2127.1s] SPEAKER_02: So just, like, try to think enough.
[2129.8s] SPEAKER_02: Try to think about, like, where you wanna be right now that probably can be something big in the future because that's exciting. And even if you bet on the wrong horse,
[2140.2s] SPEAKER_02: just betting, just being able to build things that last and don't last, is a great experience. I built tons of things that were forgotten, didn't last, and
[2151.3s] SPEAKER_02: disappeared
[2152.2s] SPEAKER_02: over the years
[2153.7s] SPEAKER_02: before I, like, stumbled into Ethereum. And even the things I built into Ethereum, I would say that almost all the projects I built
[2162.5s] SPEAKER_02: were things that didn't last, and they broke down.
[2166.4s] SPEAKER_02: But the building blocks that we sort of accidentally created
[2170.6s] SPEAKER_02: to build those things
[2172.6s] SPEAKER_02: became much bigger than the projects
[2175.1s] SPEAKER_02: I was building, or had expected to be. Right? Things like the token,
[2179.6s] SPEAKER_02: things like ENS,
[2181.4s] SPEAKER_02: things
[2182.2s] SPEAKER_02: like, like,
[2183.4s] SPEAKER_02: block, like the standards
[2185.2s] SPEAKER_02: for
[2186.2s] SPEAKER_02: a lot of, like, small things like the Identicon you see on Etherscan.
[2191.5s] SPEAKER_02: Those things were just a tiny
[2193.8s] SPEAKER_02: feature for the wallet,
[2195.7s] SPEAKER_02: and they became
[2197.9s] SPEAKER_02: big projects in themselves, much bigger than the wallet could have been. And I think that's super fun.
[2203.9s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I mean, you're motivating
[2207.0s] SPEAKER_01: me right now to get out there and build.
[2209.4s] SPEAKER_01: I really appreciate it. Well, I should. Yeah. Everybody should really build. I mean, at the end of the day, like you said, you might as well put a bet out there instead of not even jumping in the game. I mean, you know, who knows? You could be one of those pioneers. You could change the game even though you're just building something
[2226.1s] SPEAKER_01: that you know might not change the game, but at least, you know, you're in there actually trying to make a difference in something you're passionate about.
[2234.7s] SPEAKER_01: But, yeah. No. That's that's great. I like that kinda leads me to the question you were just mentioning some of it. Like,
[2240.5s] SPEAKER_01: outside of the creation of the ERC-20
[2243.9s] SPEAKER_01: and even ENS, what do you think
[2246.7s] SPEAKER_01: was your greatest contribution
[2248.8s] SPEAKER_01: in those early days? I know there was the development of things like the Web3.js library,
[2257.7s] SPEAKER_01: the easy-to-use wallet interface, the blocky Identicon,
[2261.3s] SPEAKER_01: and camel case checksums.
[2263.3s] SPEAKER_01: I know those were a lot of great developments. Is it one of those, or is it, like, potentially something else that I didn't mention?
[2274.3s] SPEAKER_02: I
[2275.2s] SPEAKER_02: so
[2276.9s] SPEAKER_02: something like, I I'm very proud of all of that. Right? But there's another very interesting project that I think what I did after,
[2285.3s] SPEAKER_02: like, the foundation is I started working on a project,
[2288.3s] SPEAKER_02: which I called Unilogin,
[2290.1s] SPEAKER_02: which was another project that went nowhere.
[2293.0s] SPEAKER_02: But, also, a lot of the ideas that were there are starting to come around, and I think those those would still be super important.
[2300.1s] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[2301.1s] SPEAKER_02: And what I wanted to do on Unilogin was I wanted everyone to stop using private keys for their
[2309.2s] SPEAKER_02: crypto. Right? I thought private keys were something that users
[2318.1s] SPEAKER_02: should never see.
[2320.8s] SPEAKER_02: And my point was I feel that everyone should have smart wallets, and that a private key was something that your device created,
[2328.3s] SPEAKER_02: never took out of the device. And whenever you lost that device, you just replaced
[2332.9s] SPEAKER_02: it with another one.
[2334.6s] SPEAKER_02: And so I worked for two years on smart wallets and things like that.
[2339.7s] SPEAKER_02: Then at some point,
[2341.6s] SPEAKER_02: we hit the wall where creating a smart wallet would cost you $100 just to acquire a new user. We had to close down the company.
[2350.6s] SPEAKER_02: But a lot of the ideas that I spent, like, two years talking about and trying to share
[2356.6s] SPEAKER_02: and explain at conferences
[2362.4s] SPEAKER_02: are now finally becoming real.

[2824.9s] SPEAKER_02: It would feel that, like, it was loading faster than what it was actually loading.
[2829.7s] SPEAKER_02: But then, like,
[2831.0s] SPEAKER_02: there's no design that can save you when the amount of time it's going to actually take is, like, a week. Mhmm. Right?
[2838.5s] SPEAKER_02: The animation can look fancy and can have a lot of cool things, but it's gonna take a week. There's no
[2846.0s] SPEAKER_01: There's no way around that. Right? There's no putting lipstick on that pig. Yeah. I think Mac was talking about that earlier in the earlier space. Mac, you can come up and say something if your mic sounds alright.
[2862.9s] SPEAKER_01: Nope. Nope. Not gonna say anything. Okay. Sounds good. I'll go to my next question.
[2869.7s] SPEAKER_01: I got a question to ask. Oh, okay. Yeah. Go ahead, brother.
[2873.4s] SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
[2874.6s] SPEAKER_03: How's everybody doing? Good. Good. Good. Glad to have you up here. Didn't know me as Magician, but you guys could just call me Mud.
[2882.5s] SPEAKER_03: I have a question for Alex.
[2886.4s] SPEAKER_03: I was gonna ask—you actually answered another question I
[2889.8s] SPEAKER_03: posted
[2890.7s] SPEAKER_03: in the Telegram,
[2892.5s] SPEAKER_03: which was,
[2894.2s] SPEAKER_03: what was your biggest concern,
[2897.2s] SPEAKER_03: as far as,
[2899.0s] SPEAKER_03: on the development side of, like, how to get or onboard the next billion users? And I think you kinda touched on it. You said account abstraction,
[2907.4s] SPEAKER_03: if I'm not mistaken.

[2910.2s] SPEAKER_03: Another question I wanted to ask was,
[2913.2s] SPEAKER_03: what's your biggest lesson that you've learned
[2915.9s] SPEAKER_03: on a personal level as far as
[2919.5s] SPEAKER_03: finding that balance in between
[2922.8s] SPEAKER_03: doing the work, like putting your head down and just
[2927.8s] SPEAKER_03: enveloping yourself into your ideas and pushing them forward and working with the team? Like, how
[2935.4s] SPEAKER_03: what's your biggest lesson you've learned with, you know, trying to push forward an idea you believe in,
[2941.8s] SPEAKER_03: but also being receptive to other people's ideas and actually trying to find a way to
[2947.3s] SPEAKER_03: make other people
[2948.6s] SPEAKER_03: see your vision?

[2952.3s] SPEAKER_02: That is a great question because I think
[2955.5s] SPEAKER_02: that's
[2956.5s] SPEAKER_02: something I've had to learn over the years.
[2958.5s] SPEAKER_02: That is how we work with a team. Right?
[2961.6s] SPEAKER_02: I think the best work I've ever done
[2965.5s] SPEAKER_02: comes from the dynamics of teamwork. I've been working with remote teams for
[2969.2s] SPEAKER_02: over ten years. Right?
[2972.0s] SPEAKER_02: Way before Zoom was a thing, and
[2976.5s] SPEAKER_02: way before COVID. We worked as
[2980.0s] SPEAKER_02: remote teams, not because we wanted to, but rather because there was no other way to get people from all over the world to work on a single project unless you flew everyone to one place. Right?

[2994.3s] SPEAKER_02: So, we had to work remotely.
[2997.2s] SPEAKER_02: Part of the challenge of working remotely is that you have a lot of
[3002.2s] SPEAKER_02: time alone to focus on your work,
[3005.7s] SPEAKER_02: without anyone
[3007.8s] SPEAKER_02: looking over your shoulder. But you also need to have
[3013.1s] SPEAKER_02: deep conversations with people. These conversations,
[3018.2s] SPEAKER_02: it’s not about you pushing your idea or simply accepting
[3024.2s] SPEAKER_02: someone else’s idea and figuring out who wins.
[3027.8s] SPEAKER_02: It’s really about
[3030.0s] SPEAKER_02: trying to
[3031.9s] SPEAKER_02: find a common ground. Right? I think, in those discussions, the ideas get better. Often and often, the way it would work is—I'll give you an example to illustrate.

[3046.0s] SPEAKER_02: I would have an idea.
[3048.5s] SPEAKER_02: Fabian Vogelsteller would have a different idea.
[3050.9s] SPEAKER_02: And we’d argue over these ideas.
[3055.3s] SPEAKER_02: Every time he made an argument against my idea, I’d come back and think, “Okay, if we change this, then that solves this issue.” He’d counter back with, “No, but if we adjust something else, my idea is stronger.” And in these back-and-forth discussions,
[3071.0s] SPEAKER_02: we’d modify each other’s ideas.

[3077.3s] SPEAKER_02: Eventually, we’d reach
[3078.6s] SPEAKER_02: a point where we both realized,
[3080.6s] SPEAKER_02: “Yeah. I think this works.”
[3081.5s] SPEAKER_02: It was almost like hitting each other’s ideas
[3087.0s] SPEAKER_02: until they evolved into something shared—a much stronger
[3093.6s] SPEAKER_02: solution. It felt like it belonged to both of us. Right? It never felt like I was giving up on something I believed in, or that I was forcing him to abandon his ideas. We both
[3109.9s] SPEAKER_02: owned the idea,
[3113.2s] SPEAKER_02: and, by debating, we created something better than either of us initially imagined.

[3120.2s] SPEAKER_02: Steve Jobs uses the term “strong beliefs, loosely held.” Meaning, you need to be passionate about your beliefs but also
[3139.6s] SPEAKER_02: willing to let them go
[3140.9s] SPEAKER_02: when a better solution emerges.

[3146.1s] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[3148.5s] SPEAKER_03: That’s interesting.
[3149.9s] SPEAKER_03: Thank you for the
[3151.7s] SPEAKER_03: answer. You actually answered
[3156.2s] SPEAKER_03: several questions I had in mind. That’s very valuable information for anyone trying
[3159.5s] SPEAKER_03: to
[3162.1s] SPEAKER_03: push forward an idea while working in a team.
[3166.5s] SPEAKER_03: Thank
[3168.2s] SPEAKER_02: you. For sure. Yeah. And think about that. It’s important, right?

[3175.8s] SPEAKER_02: A lot of my work, especially
[3177.3s] SPEAKER_02: as a designer,
[3179.7s] SPEAKER_02: involves communicating with developers
[3182.0s] SPEAKER_02: what I think users need,
[3184.9s] SPEAKER_02: and
[3185.7s] SPEAKER_02: vice versa—communicating to end users
[3189.6s] SPEAKER_02: what developers are trying to build.
[3193.7s] SPEAKER_02: As a designer, I often felt like a translator between these worlds.
[3211.5s] SPEAKER_02: And I think being that bridge is vital—helping developers see things from a user’s perspective,
[3217.4s] SPEAKER_02: while also helping to
[3219.6s] SPEAKER_02: convince users of the value in what’s being built.

[3616.0s] SPEAKER_02: Victor Maia then, he goes by Victor Taelin right now. And he worked on the Mist wallet, and he was like, I would often ask him to do a task. "Hey. Can you just integrate this library with Swarm for a bit?" And he was like, two, three days later, "Yeah. The work is done, but I need some more time because I found an upstream bug in the library." And then three days later, he was, "Yeah, I fixed the library,

[3641.2s] SPEAKER_02: but I think the library is having a

[3643.8s] SPEAKER_02: the wrong approach. Give me a few days. I'm gonna make a new library for that." And then I gave him a few days more, and he was like, "You know, I've created a new library, but I think the real problem is that LLVM is using the wrong thing. We should, like, really refactor LLVM as a whole to do the thing." And at some point, I joked with him. "Look, Victor, I can't give you more time. I know that if you just have all the time in the world, you would just want to build a whole new computer." And he was like, "Yeah. You're right. I would."

[3680.5s] SPEAKER_02: Well, guess what? Victor has all the time in the world now. He's actually building a new computer,

[3683.3s] SPEAKER_02: and he just figured out a way to

[3688.2s] SPEAKER_02: he’s been studying computer science history,

[3690.0s] SPEAKER_02: and he found a way

[3691.6s] SPEAKER_02: to create

[3695.7s] SPEAKER_02: a view of computers that are much more parallel,

[3701.1s] SPEAKER_02: can execute faster, and do a lot of things like that. I think it is fantastic.

[3706.5s] SPEAKER_02: And it's one of those things that is very hard to

[3709.1s] SPEAKER_02: communicate what they are doing,

[3712.1s] SPEAKER_02: but I think they are doing something that is going to be big.

[3722.2s] SPEAKER_02: Which is why I like working with them. Part of what I do there is just trying to explain to people what they're doing, right? And I think

[3729.0s] SPEAKER_02: we are working on a new website. It's gonna be very cool. You're gonna be able to see some animations.

[3730.2s] SPEAKER_02: But in

[3733.4s] SPEAKER_02: essence, we are

[3737.9s] SPEAKER_02: all using Turing machines. And he's like, "Look, Turing machines are wrong. There are better ways to do it." Instead of having this concept of a Turing machine, which is like a little robot with infinite tapes that goes back and forth and changes the tapes from zero to one, he’s able to turn any sort of computation

[3752.5s] SPEAKER_02: into basically a planar graph with a thousand lines. And those lines

[3759.8s] SPEAKER_02: have four little commands that they can execute,

[3763.1s] SPEAKER_02: and they can do it all at the same time. So you can run it on eight or sixteen cores at the same time, and it just becomes a very easy way to transform

[3773.3s] SPEAKER_02: any computation into something that is multi-core all the time. So, yeah, you should, if you think this sounds interesting, definitely follow the HVM

[3783.7s] SPEAKER_02: page.

[3784.5s] SPEAKER_01: How do I profit off this? Maybe. How do I invest in this?

[3789.9s] SPEAKER_02: Well, you should follow us.

[3792.9s] SPEAKER_02: If you wanna be

[3795.4s] SPEAKER_02: a pioneer yourself, maybe you can participate in this somehow.

[3799.2s] SPEAKER_01: Right? I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would.

[3804.2s] SPEAKER_01: Is that the HVM company, or is that something else?

[3808.0s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. That's I'm definitely gonna check that out and do some research because that sounds amazing. And it sounds like the guy you got on board is definitely

[3816.4s] SPEAKER_01: one of those genius pioneers you don't come across very often. So

[3822.2s] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. You should definitely follow that.

[3824.9s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm gonna look into that. I really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here.

[3830.0s] SPEAKER_01: Maybe we could do it again sometime because I still have, like, 20 other questions I wanna ask you. I know there's other people here too that wanted to come up. It's been about an hour, and I don’t want to take too much of your time. So thank you so much,

[3844.8s] SPEAKER_01: and I truly appreciate it.

[3849.2s] SPEAKER_02: Well, thank you for the invitation. It was fun to have this conversation.

[3853.6s] SPEAKER_01: Have a good day. I’ll probably stay on for a little bit, so

[3859.6s] SPEAKER_01: you're more than welcome to head out and do whatever you've gotta do. Thanks, man.

[3866.2s] SPEAKER_01: Okay. Thank you, everyone. Have a good one. Bye.

[3872.0s] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. That was great. How much longer are you gonna stay on?

[3877.3s] SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I was just letting Alex dip out to see what everybody thought. I thought that was super informative.

[3885.4s] SPEAKER_03: Yeah. You really handled it well. Good job.

[3888.1s] SPEAKER_01: Thanks. I had a whole list of stuff I wanted to ask him, but I only got through half of it. I would have stayed for another hour.

[3898.5s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I wanna do this every Monday.

[3903.7s] SPEAKER_01: So,

[3904.6s] SPEAKER_01: yeah, I'm in the chat as

[3907.9s] SPEAKER_01: an ascension guide. I was thinking about creating a little Telegram group. If anyone wants to,

[3912.8s] SPEAKER_01: shoot me a PM – my PMs are open, which is probably not the smartest thing to admit, but – my PMs are open. Just shoot me a message.

[4380.2s] SPEAKER_03: So, is is what you're saying. I have a suggestion, right?
[4383.7s] SPEAKER_03: Uh-huh. What does everybody think about
[4386.5s] SPEAKER_03: maybe
[4388.2s] SPEAKER_03: because, you know, there's, like, meme
[4390.7s] SPEAKER_03: mania right now,
[4393.1s] SPEAKER_03: and people are throwing their money at all types of
[4396.6s] SPEAKER_03: I mean, pretty much bullshit.
[4398.4s] SPEAKER_03: Right? Mhmm. And this narrative that we're looking at right now—we're dealing with this pretty much like
[4404.2s] SPEAKER_03: I mean, it it sells itself. I'm just speaking from an investor
[4407.8s] SPEAKER_03: standpoint. Right? So if liquidity is the goal,
[4412.0s] SPEAKER_03: what does everybody think about
[4414.1s] SPEAKER_03: maybe
[4416.0s] SPEAKER_03: us ourselves, instead of waiting for the, like, the Doge,
[4421.2s] SPEAKER_03: unlocking that 50k, that that'll be good.
[4425.1s] SPEAKER_03: But instead of, like, waiting
[4427.1s] SPEAKER_03: or while while we wait on that,
[4429.4s] SPEAKER_03: I mean, something that we could maybe possibly do if everybody's up for it—maybe we could start,
[4434.2s] SPEAKER_03: I don't know, maybe
[4436.0s] SPEAKER_03: our own token or something,
[4439.1s] SPEAKER_03: deploy it.
[4440.6s] SPEAKER_03: Some of us add some liquidity to that, get it up off the ground.
[4444.5s] SPEAKER_03: But X Token has the sole
[4447.8s] SPEAKER_03: and explicit purpose of,
[4450.2s] SPEAKER_03: I don't know, maybe bringing more attention to Mist itself,
[4455.7s] SPEAKER_03: and the Relic Meta itself,
[4458.5s] SPEAKER_03: and maybe, I don't know, a portion of
[4464.4s] SPEAKER_03: fees generated or,
[4466.5s] SPEAKER_03: money made,
[4468.4s] SPEAKER_03: can go towards
[4470.6s] SPEAKER_03: explicitly
[4471.9s] SPEAKER_03: providing liquidity. Mhmm.
[4475.3s] SPEAKER_01: To the pool. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting.

[4480.4s] SPEAKER_03: I think a lot of... You know, just something because, you know, we can take advantage of
[4486.0s] SPEAKER_03: the fact that there's so many people, especially on this new chain like Base, that are just buying whatever the, like, whatever the hell.
[4494.0s] SPEAKER_03: This is actually, I don't—I mean, just, I don’t know the mechanics would work, but essentially that’s how, like, the experience would go. Like, we're all in on it. We know what's up. We're already
[4505.1s] SPEAKER_03: doing what we can. I see a few of us are already, like, you know, reposting stuff and posting memes and doing what we can to, like, you know, get it out there, get attention, and market it. And that's, like, amazing.
[4515.5s] SPEAKER_03: But just an idea, you know, so we can get some, like, new money in, and we can actually use that for something. And as a community, we all agree. You know what I mean? Mhmm. Full transparency. No rug bullshit.
[4527.0s] SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Just something to think about. Maybe it sounds gimmicky, but
[4531.1s] SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Sometimes gimmicks work, and,
[4534.0s] SPEAKER_03: you know, people always wanna put their money in things. So I… That that's just where my head was at.

[4543.7s] SPEAKER_04: I would just caution against creating a new token willy-nilly because, you know,
[4545.5s] SPEAKER_04: a lot of people forget.
[4547.1s] SPEAKER_04: There's a lot of legal things that come into it, you know? So, like—
[4551.8s] SPEAKER_04: Legal? It’s—you could kinda say you're you're just splintering liquidity.
[4554.0s] SPEAKER_03: Yes.
[4555.6s] SPEAKER_04: No, no, no. Not just that. It's regulation, right? So if—if
[4557.3s] SPEAKER_04: you, you know, launch a token the proper way, you have to make sure that, like, you,
[4563.2s] SPEAKER_04: you know,
[4564.4s] SPEAKER_04: understand the legalities in different jurisdictions
[4569.3s] SPEAKER_04: because
[4570.3s] SPEAKER_04: a lot of people just don't do this because they're like, "Whatever." You know? But, you know,
[4575.5s] SPEAKER_04: it can really come back and bite you in the ass if, you know, like, "Hey, you launched a token,
[4580.6s] SPEAKER_04: and then, you know,
[4582.6s] SPEAKER_04: the SEC comes knocking." Or, you know—and remember, you're opening yourself up to
[4588.1s] SPEAKER_04: every single jurisdiction because it's blockchain, unless you explicitly say you can't trade this token in these jurisdictions.

[4595.0s] SPEAKER_03: Like, you know, on certain platforms, you can't— As an American, you can't use it. I—I—I see where you're going with it. I see where you're going. And that's definitely something that would be at the forefront of the legality of it because, you know, nobody really has time to deal with
[4609.8s] SPEAKER_03: that.

[4610.9s] SPEAKER_01: What I was thinking… Not doing it properly, I should say. If we could—I mean, I’m kinda starting this with, like, my Blockchain Historical Society and stuff—
[4619.8s] SPEAKER_01: trying to get our hands on old
[4622.3s] SPEAKER_01: relics,
[4623.4s] SPEAKER_01: and then potentially
[4625.4s] SPEAKER_01: using those as, like, a reward system
[4628.6s] SPEAKER_01: for supplying liquidity or something like that. Like, there's a lot of different ways we can go about it and still kinda
[4635.0s] SPEAKER_01: not launch our own token,
[4637.2s] SPEAKER_01: but find a way to reward those that add liquidity
[4640.4s] SPEAKER_01: or
[4641.2s] SPEAKER_01: there’s a lot of different approaches. Actually, I’ve reached out to some people—
[4648.5s] SPEAKER_01: really digging into the blockchain—and got ahold of some old developers who were launching tokens and stuff like that, via
[4651.7s] SPEAKER_01: those efforts. It could be an NFT,
[4659.3s] SPEAKER_01: it could be a lot of different things. A buddy of mine—
[4664.7s] SPEAKER_01: his name's, like, T
[4666.5s] SPEAKER_01: Scurver or something like that
[4668.9s] SPEAKER_01: on Twitter, he wrapped
[4672.0s] SPEAKER_01: a bunch of XCopy
[4673.9s] SPEAKER_01: NFTs into ERC-20 tokens.

[5124.4s] SPEAKER_04: What's it called? A
[5125.8s] SPEAKER_04: A broker? Broker-dealer. Broker-dealers, yeah, which is absolutely
[5129.4s] SPEAKER_04: insane. They're kind of just—the terminology for broker-dealer is just
[5134.0s] SPEAKER_04: not good enough. It's crazy. Yeah. I think everybody should go look that up right now. Yeah. Yeah. They're basically hanging off the definition of facilitation.

[5143.4s] SPEAKER_04: So, like,
[5144.8s] SPEAKER_04: they're saying, oh, but it facilitates.
[5147.0s] SPEAKER_04: You know? But the fact is it's a piece of—it's an application,
[5152.7s] SPEAKER_04: and it can't, it can't
[5154.7s] SPEAKER_04: execute without
[5156.4s] SPEAKER_04: you pushing a button.

[5158.5s] SPEAKER_04: So in the same sense that they're calling it a facilitator, you can say that, oh, okay, cool. Well,
[5164.5s] SPEAKER_04: Apple and
[5165.8s] SPEAKER_04: Windows and, you know, Microsoft
[5168.7s] SPEAKER_04: should also be in this—
[5172.1s] SPEAKER_04: what do you call it—court case because they're also facilitating
[5175.7s] SPEAKER_04: these things. They're facilitating
[5177.3s] SPEAKER_04: in the same way that MetaMask is. Yeah. I wouldn't worry about—I wouldn't worry about, like, you know, regulations
[5183.7s] SPEAKER_04: for—
[5185.0s] SPEAKER_04: a token, like a bridge token,
[5187.9s] SPEAKER_04: because—
[5189.5s] SPEAKER_04: the onus is that you're bridging; the origin is the Mist, and none of us here are the creator of Mist. So, that would basically just be like opening up
[5202.8s] SPEAKER_04: making a case against a token
[5205.4s] SPEAKER_04: that has already gone through the rigmarole. So, you know, I don't think we worry about bridge tokens.

[5213.1s] SPEAKER_04: Every single bridge token would also need to then doubly
[5217.4s] SPEAKER_04: kind of, like, prove itself, which is ridiculous.

[5221.3s] SPEAKER_04: But—
[5222.7s] SPEAKER_04: I like the idea of,
[5224.9s] SPEAKER_04: of an extra kind of—
[5227.7s] SPEAKER_04: like, it's almost like a marketing campaign, like an onboarding campaign.

[5231.8s] SPEAKER_03: I'm gonna also think about it and chat to you, AC, about it. I think we have the power to do it with the amount of people that are already
[5238.3s] SPEAKER_03: interested in Mist,
[5241.4s] SPEAKER_03: because of the whole relic—
[5244.4s] SPEAKER_03: meta thing. Like,
[5246.3s] SPEAKER_03: it's not just about price go up. Like, I think the biggest thing that attracted me to it was just not the marketability
[5253.4s] SPEAKER_03: of Mist itself
[5255.2s] SPEAKER_03: due to the provenance and the history
[5257.9s] SPEAKER_03: and the associations. But—
[5260.7s] SPEAKER_03: how—
[5261.6s] SPEAKER_03: I'm literally in real time seeing
[5264.3s] SPEAKER_03: OGs, like Ethereum OGs, you know, kind of double back. Like, because
[5270.7s] SPEAKER_03: it's kind of like a callback to original—
[5275.6s] SPEAKER_03: the community,
[5276.6s] SPEAKER_03: you know, before—
[5278.2s] SPEAKER_03: before—
[5279.4s] SPEAKER_03: the 2021
[5280.8s] SPEAKER_03: blow-off top, before
[5282.6s] SPEAKER_03: meme coin mania, before Solana, before all that. Like, the OG feel, like how it was back in the day. Like, people have something that they can actually call back to.

[5298.4s] SPEAKER_03: Literally, it's what it's called, a callback, like in writing or if anybody
[5308.2s] SPEAKER_03: writes screenplays or anything like that or has anything to do with entertainment. A callback is kind of like—or like in a joke, a callback is when you're literally referring back to
[5318.7s] SPEAKER_03: something else that was said. I feel like Mist is kind of like a callback to a time, you know what I mean? Like a vibe—
[5322.9s] SPEAKER_03: Mhmm.
[5323.8s] SPEAKER_03: On Ethereum that people can actually see. Plus, the timestamp thing is super, super, super smart. I don't know who came up with that,
[5328.3s] SPEAKER_03: but that's really good. That's—that's really good.

[5331.2s] SPEAKER_01: Even Alex said that. And Alex is like—Alex is like—
[5335.0s] SPEAKER_01: like, I'm not FUDding or anything like that, but Alex is like he's still kind of, like,
[5339.5s] SPEAKER_01: just blown back at what Mist has become. He did not expect it
[5344.1s] SPEAKER_01: to get to this point, which is fine. You know? He was just building, and he ended up building something great.

[5353.2s] SPEAKER_01: Trying to give him the flowers, bro, and he was like, nah.
[5355.2s] SPEAKER_01: No. He's just—what he is. He's humble. He's just a builder. Yeah. He's a good guy.

[5360.4s] SPEAKER_01: I've had a couple of, like,
[5363.2s] SPEAKER_01: conversations with him outside of the,
[5364.7s] SPEAKER_01: the space. But he just—yeah, he just wants to build and make good things.
