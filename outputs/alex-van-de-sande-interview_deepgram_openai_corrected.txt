ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[150.8s] What's going on, everybody?

HOST:
[152.7s] Alex, I sent you an invite to speak
[156.6s] and cohost.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[167.5s] If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
[180.0s] Good to see the faces piling in.
[182.9s] Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
[195.5s] Here. There we go.
[199.7s] Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.

HOST:
[212.0s] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions,
[217.0s] just feel free to raise your hand.
[236.5s] Kinda.
[240.6s] Kinda a bit, like, underwatery.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[278.9s] Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay.
[282.4s] Let me see.

HOST:
[296.1s] Just give us a few moments, guys. Trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[322.5s] Technology.
[331.9s] Cartoons, you wanna come up?
[336.9s] I'll invite you.
[338.6s] Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak.
[344.6s] You are here for episode zero, so
[379.8s] About you.
[381.5s] Got you, Mac.
[403.0s] Wish that my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

SPEAKER_02:
[416.0s] You should sing, AG.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[420.4s] Who said that? Alex? Hey.

SPEAKER_02:
[423.5s] Hey. You should play some live music.

HOST:
[427.6s] I I was playing some classical music, but,
[432.0s] yeah. No. It's good to have you on here. I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on.
[439.3s] It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[443.4s] So, really, I just wanna kinda pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly. Like,
[449.8s] more than just, you know, MistCoin
[451.9s] in general, but really just, like,
[454.3s] how you got started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot. So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum, and what was your
[464.0s] kind of first initial reaction to it?

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[468.6s] Sure. I I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists
[477.0s] now.
[478.2s] So I find it funny. A little bit weird, but it's fun.
[484.3s] So,
[486.2s] I think I started
[489.2s] being interested in Bitcoin around 2012.
[494.1s] So that was
[496.0s] in—like, it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I already felt like, "Oh God. I missed it. They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on live TV."
[508.9s] I'm like, "Oh no." But, like, it used to be under a dollar. Now it's, like, $10.
[514.8s] Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right? That's too bad.
[518.8s] I even remember, like, I posted something on the forums saying, "Oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at $5. I paid."
[526.0s] It was so hard.
[527.8s] And then someone simply, like, I think,
[530.3s] tipped me, like, 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey, here's
[534.8s] here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin." And it was, like, back then—I don't know—
[541.6s] like, probably a full Bitcoin. Right?
[545.4s] So, like, Bitcoin was $5
[547.4s] back then. So that was—that was those early days. Uh-huh.
[553.8s] Again,
[554.7s] didn't feel too early.
[557.4s] And then
[558.8s] I started paying attention
[560.7s] because I felt that I knew something bigger would come,
[565.7s] after Bitcoin.
[566.9s] And I just started following all sorts of projects, like, Colored Coins,
[572.6s] Mastercoin, and things like that. Uh-huh. And so I found Ethereum.
[577.0s] And I was, "Wow." I was so blown away and captivated
[581.0s] that I couldn't think of anything else. And the—
[585.2s] people were still very active on the Reddit. Like, Vitalik [Buterin] would answer
[590.3s] questions personally.
[592.5s] And then I just started helping out on the forum or on the Reddit.
[596.8s] I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, "Hey, there are enough coders here. Maybe they need a designer," and then someone would ask something for a presentation I could give them.
[608.8s] And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started
[613.2s] having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got
[620.0s] started working with some crazy people.

HOST:
[624.0s] So you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved
[627.6s] and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of
[631.2s] jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[638.2s] I certainly didn't expect it to—like,
[641.0s] sort of yes and no. Because I felt it back then.
[645.0s] It seemed very obvious that Ethereum was going to be a big thing, and I was like, "I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this." I was like, "Can't— I felt like telling everybody I knew, ‘Can't you see? Look at this, this is—this is crazy! It's like a blockchain, but it’s a computer inside.’” And people were, like—
[667.0s] people were acting as if I was crazy. Like, I
[674.0s] was a founder of a company back then. I was doing, like, an iPhone app, sort of like Instagram with *professionalistas*,
[681.3s] and I had raised money with—like—but the app wasn’t going anywhere, and I realized that I wasn’t
[687.6s] using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.
[695.1s] And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this. They were like, "Are you, like, leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old? They're going to pay you in, like, made-up money that he invented."
[709.2s] I was like, "Yeah, sure. That seems like a great idea."

**Corrected Transcript:**

[1275.4s] you someone else thinks about a new feature
[1278.1s] or that you need to, like, create a whole new
[1281.7s] new upgrade to
[1283.6s] your blockchain.
[1284.9s] So
[1288.7s] I'm

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1292.7s] I think you might have rubbed there.
[1296.3s] Can't hear you.
[1298.0s] Is it just me, Mac? Can you hear him?

**Unidentified Speaker:**
[1300.5s] No. That's a

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1407.7s] Alright. Let's see.
[1409.6s] Alright. Good. I'm I'm back. Here. Alright. Awesome.
[1413.7s] Yeah. So
[1415.0s] I don't even know where you left off.

**Unidentified Speaker (Mac?):**
[1417.8s] I was talking about tokens.

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1419.3s] Yeah. Talking about tokens. Yeah.

**Unidentified Speaker (Mac?):**
[1423.3s] I might have only one who heard

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1425.3s] who couldn't understand anything that Mac said because he was very distorted. Or Yeah. He was a bit distorted. I don't know what's going on with that.
[1434.0s] Yeah.
[1437.9s] Okay.
[1438.8s] So yeah. So you were talking about,
[1441.4s] like, you know, Mastercoin
[1443.3s] and those types
[1444.7s] of projects, and you had to, like, you know, release a whole
[1447.8s] token and stuff. I was just I was asking more about, like,
[1451.5s] who decided to just, like,

**Unidentified Speaker (Mac?):**
[1454.9s] play with the Mist token and just, like, oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit. Like

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1457.4s] Well, that's what I'm getting at, right? So we knew tokens were important. And then at some point, I posted like, we decided, hey, we we want to do a token
[1469.0s] release on this.
[1470.5s] And I posted on Reddit, like, hey, let's talk about the coin,
[1475.6s] standard. Let's talk about something. There was a very interesting conversation
[1479.9s] out of that.
[1480.9s] Based on that conversation,
[1482.8s] Fabian Vogelsteller wrote
[1484.7s] the
[1485.8s] ERC standard.
[1489.7s] And when we we released the and and then when we released the the the new Mist Wallet, we wanted people to try out because there were no tokens on Ethereum. Like, there was nothing you could tokenize.
[1502.2s] So we basically released two tokens. One came with the wallet and was the Unicorn thing. Whenever you donated to the foundation, you got a Unicorn.
[1511.1s] And the other
[1512.4s] that we wanted people to be able to play with it for free was just, like,
[1516.9s] something that Fabian
[1518.4s] created,
[1521.3s] literally for fun just using, like, the standard thing that they had. Mhmm. And then just started giving away for free on Reddit just for people to try it out. Mhmm.
[1530.2s] Like, nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just this is the best thing that we wanna try out
[1536.9s] and wanted people to play around with.

**Unidentified Speaker (Mac?):**
[1539.1s] Of course. Yeah. No. I I get it. And in regard to the Unicorn, the Unicorn token was, like,
[1545.0s] five, six months later, though. Right?

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1547.5s] Is it?
[1548.6s] Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts, I don’t know if it was Really? It I didn’t know. I don’t know if it was, like, talked about, like, internally, but not released until later. But, yeah, it was released in 2016,
[1560.6s] couple months. I think it was two or three months.
[1563.4s] And I I think Unicorns are great too, but, I mean, I I I can’t. They're very hard to get ahold of. So yeah. I mean

**Unidentified Speaker (Mac?):**
[1571.4s] As as you say, like, trust trust the timestamp. Right? I mean, like, if you were asking me, I would swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.
[1584.3s] Maybe we hadn’t that.

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1586.7s] Yeah. Yeah. I don’t think that you did, but the thing is that,
[1590.9s] Unicorn is actually, like, an ERC-20,
[1594.0s] quote-unquote, actually an ERC-20 because Mist is basically
[1597.5s] an ERC-20 besides the `approve` function.
[1601.9s] So it was, like, that’s why if you go look at the Unicorns,
[1606.2s] I’m pretty sure they have all of the
[1609.3s] ERC-20
[1610.6s] standard implemented,
[1612.0s] whereas Mist is basically like the bit—the skeleton for it. You know? It’s just missing a few parts, or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20. But Fabian considers
[1624.2s] it. I think you had a, you know, a good,
[1628.1s] outlook on exactly, you know, how it met the standard besides the `approve` function.

**Alex Van De Sande:**
[1633.3s] But, yeah,
[1634.4s] that’s super,
[1636.3s] super interesting.
[1637.7s] I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kinda helped
[1642.0s] in, like, whether it be, like, just ideating or actually getting in there and coding? Because I know you said you didn’t— you weren’t really a coder—that kinda helped with figuring out this ERC-20 standard. Was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned,
[1656.2s] Gavin Wood. I didn’t know if he was kinda
[1659.7s] in the coding side of things too, or was it really just, like, Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

**Notes on Changes:**
1. Correctly punctuated and capitalized terms like "ERC-20", "approve function", and "Mist Wallet."
2. Identified **Alex Van De Sande** as a speaker based on references to "Mist Wallet" and his known involvement in Ethereum.
3. Adjusted sentence structures for clarity.
4. Preserved timestamps and added paragraph breaks for readability.
5. Left speaker identities as "Unidentified" where context did not provide enough clues.

```plaintext
[2257.7s] The easy-to-use wallet interface, the blocky Identicon,
[2261.3s] and camel case checksum.
[2263.3s] I know those were a lot of great developments. Is it one of those, or is it, like, potentially something else that I didn't mention?

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[2274.3s] I
[2275.2s] so
[2276.9s] something like, I'm very proud of all of that. Right? But there's another very interesting project that I think what I did after,
[2285.3s] like, the Foundation is I started working on a project,
[2288.3s] which I called Unilogin,
[2290.1s] which was another project that went nowhere.
[2293.0s] But also, a lot of the ideas that were there are starting to come around, and I think those would be super important.
[2300.1s] Right?

[2301.1s] And what I wanted to do with Unilogin was I wanted everyone to stop using private keys for their
[2309.2s] crypto. Right? I thought private keys
[2315.6s] were something that wasn't user-friendly—
[2318.1s] something a user should never see.
[2320.8s] And my point was that I feel everyone should have smart wallets, and that a private key should be something your device creates,
[2328.3s] never takes out of the device. And whenever you lose that device, you just replace
[2332.9s] it with another one.
[2334.6s] So I worked for two years on smart wallets and things like that.
[2339.7s] Then at some point,
[2341.5s] we hit a wall in which creating a smart wallet would cost something like $100 just to acquire a new user. We had to close down the company.

[2350.6s] But a lot of those ideas that I spent, like, two years talking about and
[2356.6s] trying to share
[2358.5s] and trying to, like,
[2360.5s] present at conferences,
[2362.4s] are
[2363.3s] now finally, with account abstraction and things like that, becoming real.
[2367.7s] Because,
[2368.8s] people are—like today—the
[2373.5s] word is "account abstraction."
[2373.5s] Right? And I think
[2374.8s] it's still one of the most important things to happen
[2378.7s] if we want blockchains to go mainstream.
[2381.9s] For users to never have to care about private keys again, right? Where you just have a name,
[2390.0s] and that name is connected to multiple devices.
[2395.5s] And,
[2396.3s] basically, you use one device to allow you to access others. Right?

[2402.1s] And I think we’ve
[2403.0s] reached—
[2410.0s] or are probably reaching—a moment where this will be able to happen. Right? Now we have not only
[2410.0s] cheaper Layer 2 (L2) solutions that allow for more wallet innovation,
[2416.6s] but it's easier for you to
[2416.6s] deploy contracts and already have the address of a smart wallet contract that can be deployed across all L2s at the same time. We also have technologies like FastKeys,
[2425.3s] which is a cryptographic standard accepted by
[2430.5s] Android and Apple devices,
[2433.1s] which is
[2434.4s] really great for logging in.
[2436.7s] And I think it's,
[2440.5s] like,
[2441.8s] something I'm very happy to see
[2446.2s] grow within crypto.
[2448.4s] Well, yes. I am proud of all the other achievements you
[2453.3s] mentioned.

SPEAKER_01:
[2454.3s] No. Yeah. That's actually really interesting because,
[2458.7s] I'm actually developing some stuff now, and my developer constantly talks to me about how big account abstraction is going to be for this next
[2467.3s] bull run.
[2468.5s] You know, bull run and stuff like that. And,
[2471.3s] it is fascinating to hear that you were actually working on something like this a few
[2477.6s] years ago. Was it back in 2018?

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[2480.3s] Yeah. 2018 was the first time I ever talked about that.

SPEAKER_01:
[2483.2s] I think you were just ahead of your time, to be honest. You know? Like, this is really huge when it comes to onboarding
[2491.7s] new, like, users—quote-unquote "normies"—
[2494.7s] because nobody wants to, you know, have to store their private key and worry about all that nonsense.
[2501.2s] And you were working on it back in 2018. It was just maybe the space
[2505.7s] wasn’t mature enough back then, and, obviously, it wasn’t to the point where it is now.
[2512.0s] Damn, that sucks. I would really like to see, maybe,
[2515.2s] Unilogin make a comeback.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:
[2517.8s] I'm pretty sure the things I wanted
[2521.6s] to achieve will function and exist eventually.
[2524.9s] I'm happy to see them happening because I think it’s super important for
[2530.2s] us to reach the mainstream adoption we all want.

SPEAKER_01:
[2534.7s] Yeah, no. That's great.
[2537.6s] Taking it a little bit back to the beginning again,
[2541.8s] what were, like, your main challenges
[2544.6s] and considerations
[2546.7s] when it came to the Mist Wallet and,
[2550.6s] the early development of it—especially in relation to the fact that Ethereum was so early
[2557.1s] and it was still evolving?
[2559.1s] What do you think about that? What were your biggest
[2562.6s] challenges or considerations
[2566.9s] you kept in mind when building?

```
[3180.1s] to the developers
[3182.0s] the things I was seeing that users needed.
[3184.9s] And
[3185.7s] and sometimes, I was trying to communicate to final users
[3189.6s] the thing that the developer wanted to build that couldn't
[3193.7s] be understood,
[3194.7s] so as a designer, I felt I was constantly translating from those words. Right? I was looking at something that developers want to build. This thing nobody understands what it is. I would translate it to, like, an end user. And then I would, like, advocate for the end user saying, "Hey, this is how we are gonna build
[3211.5s] this thing for them." And I think being that portion in between is super important. And often,
[3217.4s] what you do a lot is just
[3219.6s] you're trying to communicate and convincing people that this is a good thing worth building.

SPEAKER_01:
[3226.2s] Yeah. That... yeah. That that's — I appreciate that question, Mark, because even though
[3231.6s] it's a bit of a situation with me, I'm dealing with the same thing when it comes to, you know, trying to find a healthy,
[3237.7s] positive, collaborative environment
[3239.8s] instead of, like, you know, being at each other's necks and trying to figure out who's right or what's the best way to go.

[3245.7s] Sometimes the collaborative... you know, there needs to be a sense of positivity and an understanding that the end goal is the same for everybody. You know, how we get there is — that's how you work together and figure out the best way to approach that problem. And, you know, it's tough to work with teams, especially
[3262.9s] when remote. You're not there to see people's reactions in person and judge body language. It's tough at times.

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
[3272.0s] Yeah. And you have to listen. Right? If you feel that your ideas are pure
[3278.3s] beauty and genius
[3280.0s] and that everyone is trying to ruin it, you're probably not a very good
[3285.5s] team member, and probably your ideas aren't that great. Right? You have to have humility and understand that other people also have good ideas on how to improve your thing.

SPEAKER_01:
[3297.8s] Yeah. I mean, and nowadays with this culture — I mean, some of these Crypto Twitter people and stuff like that, like, there's a lot of arrogance where everybody thinks they know it all.

[3309.2s] If you can't
[3310.5s] take a step back and see that you don't know it all and you never will, you know, you're better off as a team because you can actually take that receptive criticism and take those other ideas and mesh it into one, like you're saying. Now it's not just one idea, it's everybody's idea. And everybody put in the time and effort and now they all feel kinda emotionally connected to that idea, you know.

[3336.9s] Yeah. That was a great question, Mark. Especially as I'm, you know, dealing with that stuff on my own, building. It's really nice to hear something like that.

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
[3347.6s] Can you hear me now about insurance? I think we have time for one last question. Okay. One last question.

SPEAKER_01:
[3355.2s] Can you hear me along? Yeah. Yeah. We can hear you.
[3359.0s] Do you wanna ask the final question? I was gonna try to —

SPEAKER_03:
[3362.2s] Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. I'll be just quick.
[3366.2s] So I think you mentioned, Alex, that there were a lot of attempts to do,
[3371.2s] you know,
[3374.8s] essentially on-chain wallets and stuff. I know that the ETHSwarm team was working quite early on,
[3380.9s] like Daniel Nagy and some other guys like Ido Shaderin on an on-chain wallet called EthLogin.
[3389.2s] Were you familiar with that one? It wasn't that early, but,
[3393.8s] it was something that I also came across and did a little bit of work on probably two years ago. And second small question:
[3403.0s] The Parity wallet came out just after Mist Wallet. Was that an attempt to solve the issue with the syncing of the whole node? Because I remember that that one,
[3412.6s] there were statements saying they would try and run that on, like, a light client and only sync a portion of the chain.

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
[3423.2s] So I worked with Daniel Nagy, if that's the same person. He was also on the Swarm team. Yeah. I don't remember his work on
[3431.7s] EthLogin. That's interesting.

[3434.8s] Not sure what you mean by on-chain wallets.
[3440.0s] As for the Parity
[3441.0s] light client thing, since I was working
[3444.7s] with Mist at the time, there were always claims that, "Yeah, this light client sync or this new light client sync is going to solve
[3452.1s] all light client problems." Right? So there's always
[3461.4s] claims like that, and, like, I —
[3463.2s] we tried a lot of them. And I think
[3466.2s] I still don't think there's a
[3471.0s] very good way to really have a fully decentralized light client
[3478.3s] that
[3479.1s] can just connect to it. Right?

[3482.3s] First of all,
[3487.1s] because it's hard to do.
[3489.9s] Often,
[3491.0s] and this is even sadder, the user doesn't really care. That's also a big problem. Always,
[3497.7s] often, the user — like, if you say, "Look, instead of taking, like, one gigabyte or ten gigabytes, this thing is gonna take 100 megabytes."
[3506.0s] And the user just says, "Why do I even wanna use this 100 megabytes when I can just connect to Etherscan or whatever?"
[3515.5s] And then
[3516.7s] that's never good enough for a user.

[3521.0s] Yeah. Tough.

[3523.1s] So, yeah, "The user didn't care" is
[3526.9s] an epitaph for a thousand
[3529.6s] decentralized projects everywhere.

SPEAKER_03:
[3532.3s] Awesome. Thank you for answering that. I tagged you in the comment with the repo I was talking about. And, yes, it was Daniel Nagy from ETHSwarm. I
[3539.3s] did a bit of work with him two years ago.

SPEAKER_01:
[3543.6s] Alex, I have one more question for you so you have time to plug what you're working on. I saw that you're working on a new project called The High Order Company.
[3553.3s] Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, its goals, and what you're currently working on? And after that, I just, you know, appreciate your time and everything.

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
[3563.8s] Sure...

[4031.3s] I think there's, like, is it properly bridged? More it's bridged, but the liquidity is very, very small because
[4037.5s] a lot of people haven't really bridged over. So what we were planning to do is what
[4043.0s] I was gonna talk to
[4045.2s] Alex Van De Sande about, but we didn't get enough time. There was actually
[4049.4s] a Doge
[4051.0s] -ETH bridge
[4052.2s] that
[4053.0s] Ethereum was planning back in, like, 2017,
[4056.1s] and there was 50,000
[4058.5s] Mist, valued at about a million dollars,
[4061.5s] that were sent to this Doge kind of bounty because it was a bounty. So it was like, whoever can make a bridge between
[4069.0s] Doge
[4069.8s] and ETH, you have a bounty. And it was like a shit ton of ETH. And the Mist was kinda just thrown in there as, I don't know, a joke
[4077.6s] or something. I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask him about. I was like, who kinda thought about sending that. So,
[4084.6s] there's actually
[4086.3s] some crazy signers on there, like Alex,
[4090.2s] I don't know. I think Fabian Vogelsteller,
[4091.9s] but Vitalik (most likely referring to Vitalik Buterin) is on there as a signer.
[4094.8s] Like, there's a lot of big names on there as signers. If we could somehow
[4099.9s] get
[4100.7s] the attention of enough signers to
[4103.7s] go ahead and unlock that 50
[4106.2s] - that 50k Mist coins, we could have -
[4108.9s] okay. Here's Victor. Hold on one second.
[4111.4s] We could
[4112.5s] have potentially
[4114.0s] enough to bridge over to Base, maybe do a little bit of, like, a DAO incentive thing because there is a DAO for Mist coin that I set up via Snapshot,
[4123.7s] and then go ahead and maybe pay out some developers for building cool things on top of Mist. Like, that 50k would be very, very valuable if we could somehow
[4133.0s] snatch it up. But,

SPEAKER_04:
[4135.0s] What's going on, Victor? Oh, yeah. My bad.

SPEAKER_05:
[4137.5s] No. You're good. Yes. First of all, congratulations on this initiative. I think it's great. Please keep it up because I think that this Mist Monday
[4146.0s] is something that we need to keep. And secondly, about the liquidity in Base, just remember, guys, that Uniswap
[4152.8s] pools are permissionless, no? So everybody's free to pool their own liquidity. At the end of the day, I mean, if everybody,
[4161.3s] let's say, pools, like, 10% of their holdings of Mist or 5%, or just a tiny, tiny amount, at the end, the liquidity there will be more healthy, and we will progressively be
[4173.0s] building more liquidity
[4174.4s] in Base, you know? I mean,
[4176.2s] maybe now we don't have too much volume there because the liquidity is tiny, so nobody would be interested in trading there. But it's something like
[4183.4s] progressively, no? The more
[4185.3s] people pool liquidity there, the more volume we will have there, and I think
[4190.3s] we will have more exposure there eventually. So I think that maybe waiting for releasing these tokens of DogeDAO,
[4197.5s] maybe it will take time. So maybe we can combine the effort of providing some liquidity by ourselves.
[4204.2s] You know that gas fees now on the mainnet are very low. So I think that everybody can afford to do a swap in mainnet because, well,
[4212.1s] the gas this morning, I guess, was in seven, six gwei or something like that. So
[4217.8s] it's not too expensive.

SPEAKER_03:
[4220.2s] Do you know who created the Base side
[4223.9s] Mist coin,
[4225.8s] essentially the bridge?

SPEAKER_05:
[4227.9s] Yeah. It's me. But, well, there is a tool in Base called Base Migrate. So everybody is free to do that. It's very simple. It's just two or three steps, and you have, like, a tutorial developed by the Base team. So everybody is free to do the same with any ERC-20 token.
[4245.1s] It just takes, like,
[4247.1s] thirty minutes for the whole process and later on, like, five, six days to have the pull request in GitHub approved.

SPEAKER_03:
[4254.8s] Yeah. I actually was speaking about this earlier,
[4258.6s] on the earlier
[4261.0s] space. I was saying how Base is really, really popping off and how Layer 2s have made it really, really easy for,
[4268.9s] I mean,
[4270.8s] lots of different use cases.
[4273.4s] But surely, we don't need liquidity
[4277.6s] specifically. We only need liquidity for Mist tokens if people want to bridge
[4283.0s] back from
[4284.9s] Base to Ethereum, right? Because, well, it depends on how the bridge is set up. But if you're bridging from Ethereum mainnet to Base, you essentially
[4295.4s] are minting a new token on the Base side.
[4298.6s] In that way, you could basically
[4300.8s] - it's
[4301.8s] ready for you. So anybody who wants to bridge from
[4305.2s] Ethereum just bridges it, mints the new token on Base. But, obviously, bridging it back from Base
[4312.1s] to Ethereum would require more liquidity.

SPEAKER_01:
[4318.4s] Yeah. I think it locks up that Mist, and that's why it's only one specific bridge. I don't think there are multiple bridges. So if you lock your Mist in that contract, it mints the Base token. Then you put that Base back in there, and it unlocks the Mist, that, you know, whatever amount it was, and stuff like that.

SPEAKER_03:
[4338.9s] So the supply can only be as high as how much people lock up in that initial ETH bridge. Yeah. So the liquidity is just that - we want liquidity just in case we wanna bridge back from Base. So anybody who has Mist, we don't - you can just go ahead and bridge across.

SPEAKER_05:
[4355.0s] Yes. Yeah. I was referring
[4357.1s] just to the liquidity in Uniswap, just in case you want to do some swaps from, say, USDT in Base to Mist in Base. Just that.
[4365.1s] As I was saying, I mean, you don't need liquidity on both sides to make the bridge work in such a way that once you bridge one token from mainnet to the Base side, I mean, it's, like, frozen. It's, like, locked.

SPEAKER_03:
[4376.6s] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we need more liquidity providers

SPEAKER_04:
[4380.2s] is what you're saying. I have a suggestion, right?
[4383.7s] What does everybody think about
[4386.5s] maybe
[4388.2s] - because, you know, there's, like, meme
[4390.7s] mania right now.

```plaintext
[4870.3s] It could be we could do a certain percentage or fee just to build up,
[4876.8s] a little bit of whether it be a treasury or some liquidity to move over the Base because,
[4883.6s] seeding Base liquidity would be

SPEAKER_04:
[4887.2s] really, really great. Just that was my point. Yeah. We need we should do that. That was, like, the crux of what I was getting at, really. It just needs to be tasteful because you don't wanna dilute

SPEAKER_01:
[4897.9s] Of course. What we have here. Like, the like, whether
[4901.7s] Mist has liquidity on Base or not, like, in my opinion, this is not financial advice, it doesn't matter. At some point, Mist is gonna come across the right eyes, and this thing is gonna blow the fuck up.

[4914.2s] Would it be nice to have, you know, nice liquidity on two chains just to give other people options? You know, ETH will be, at some point,
[4922.7s] it is hot right now. At some point, it will not be unusable, but very expensive to use, and that will drive a lot of people away.
[4932.9s] So it would be nice to get, you know, another chain functional with cheaper gas.

SPEAKER_04:
[4938.4s] People like these. People love it.

SPEAKER_01:
[4941.1s] Yeah. No. Base is I have some questions about Base on, you know, some things they said, like,
[4946.5s] if something did go down, I think they would bend the knee to the SEC, and if you don’t fucking give up your information, you won’t be able to bridge out or something like that. It’s always a possibility.

SPEAKER_04:
[4957.2s] Yeah. I see them handing out Wells notices and stuff. Like, I’ve been seeing that. I don’t even know what that is, but it’s probably like—

SPEAKER_03:
[4965.8s] The Wells notice? Yeah.
[4968.5s] Oh, it’s just pretty much like,
[4971.9s] in layman’s terms, it’s kinda like a forewarning
[4973.2s] or like a chance. That’s like what the SEC gives companies, like, “Hey, just a heads up.
[4979.9s] We figure you’re doing something that falls out of bounds of the law. Yeah. And,
[4984.8s] this is your chance. So this is your, like,
[4987.4s] acknowledgment. This is your chance to
[4989.8s] realize we're on you pretty much or, like, something’s coming.”

SPEAKER_03:
[4995.1s] It’s not an official charge. It’s just kinda like a notice. Yeah. They’re essentially saying, “We are coming. We are going to take you to court for X and Y, and you should start
[5008.2s] preparing your defense.” Right? Prepare yourself.

SPEAKER_04:
[5013.4s] It’s intent—intent to prosecute. I’ve seen it with Robinhood. I’ve seen it with some other exchanges. So what you just said about Base, yes, that is also something that we should think about,
[5023.6s] you know,
[5025.4s] focusing in too much of our eggs in that Base basket. I just figured Base because only because of the popularity, but, yes, that is also a concern that I think about as well. I mean Base—Base is the US.

SPEAKER_03:
[5036.4s] Base is pretty safe, purely because it is Coinbase, and Coinbase has actually
[5041.9s] gone through the rigmarole
[5043.6s] with the SEC. I think that it’s
[5046.6s] it could be there could be more right now, but it’s like Coinbase is the only one that’s
[5051.8s] kind of backed. It’s fair
[5055.6s] that it’s insured, essentially.
[5058.2s] So they went through that whole process, which is good.
[5063.2s] But
[5064.9s] yeah, I mean, if you didn’t know, Joe Lubin from ConsenSys is actually taking the SEC to court because of all these Wells notices to different companies like Uniswap.

SPEAKER_01:
[5077.7s] What’s wrong? Gary didn’t get, you know, didn’t get the job at Binance, so now he’s all salty and just throwing notices at everybody.

SPEAKER_03:
[5089.0s] They’re going off on MetaMask. They’re going back on

SPEAKER_04:
[5094.1s] all the wallets. It’s like they’re trying to—it's like Operation Choke Point. We’re still in it. Yeah. They’re basically trying to now say, “Hey,

SPEAKER_03:
[5104.1s] you know, it is a security,” even though they’ve
[5107.5s] gone through
[5108.8s] like, the same people who are saying that it’s not a security have actually,
[5113.6s] you know, stated that it is
[5116.1s] a—what do you call it—commodity
[5118.9s] in the past.

[5702.3s] So I'm probably gonna wrap it up there, guys.

[5705.4s] Anybody that, you know, wants to shoot me a PM, you're more than welcome. I appreciate everybody jumping on. I think Alex Van De Sande had a lot of great things to say.

[5714.7s] Yeah. I’m excited for the future.

[5722.2s] Appreciate you, man. Thank you, Summer. Yeah. For sure. I'll see you guys potentially next Monday.

[5728.8s] I wanna do this every Monday, but at the very least, like, every couple Mondays.

[5732.6s] So I'll keep everybody posted in the chat and,

[5736.3s] the Myst Telegram, and, yeah, we'll, we'll talk there. Thanks, everybody.
