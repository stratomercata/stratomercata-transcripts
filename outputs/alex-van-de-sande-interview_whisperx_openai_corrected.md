**SPEAKER_02:**
[145.6s] What's going on everybody?
[152.9s] Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and co-host.
[167.7s] If you have any questions, just let me know.
[169.6s] You can DM me.
[180.1s] Good to see the faces piling in.
[183.0s] Got a lot of good questions here.
[184.7s] Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
[195.5s] Here.
[196.5s] There we go.
[199.9s] Alex, good to have you here, man.
[201.2s] Appreciate it.
[212.2s] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.
[236.6s] Kind of.
[240.6s] Kind of a bit, like, under-watery.
[265.2s] Huh.
[278.9s] Is Victor out here?
[280.5s] No, Victor, okay.
[282.6s] Let me see.
[296.4s] Give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up.
[299.5s] Appreciate your patience.
[322.1s] Ah, Technology Cartoons, you want to come up? I'll invite you. Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak—you were here for episode zero, so...
[380.0s] How about you?
[381.7s] Got you, Mac.
[403.1s] I wish that my phone wasn't so dumb.
[404.6s] I'll DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[416.1s] You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[420.5s] Who said that?
[421.7s] Alex?
[422.4s] Hey.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[422.9s] Hey.
[425.3s] You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[427.8s] I was playing some classical music, but yeah, I don't know.
[433.0s] It's good to have you on here.
[434.3s] I'm glad the mic's all working out now.
[436.1s] I really appreciate you jumping on.
[439.5s] It's been an interesting six months, for sure.
[442.3s] Yeah.
[443.4s] So really, I just want to kind of just pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly—like more than just, you know, Mist Wallet in general, but really just like how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.
[458.9s] So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[466.3s] Sure.

[469.2s] I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that...
[472.8s] I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
[478.2s] So I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.

[484.4s] So I think I started being interested in Bitcoin around 2012.
[494.2s] And it feels like a long time ago—it feels like the early days.
[496.0s] But for me, I already felt like, "Oh, God, I missed it."
[500.0s] They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife*, on live TV.
[509.0s] I'm like, "Oh, no, but it used to be under a dollar."
[512.1s] Now it's like $10.
[512.9s] Damn, I so missed Bitcoin, right?
[517.1s] That's too bad.

[518.8s] I even remember I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh, no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5.
[524.8s] It was so hard."
[527.9s] And then someone generously tipped me like five Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey, here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin."
[537.6s] And it was back then, I don't know, probably a full Bitcoin, right?
[545.3s] Bitcoin was $5 back then.

[548.1s] So that was those early days.
[551.6s] Again, it didn't feel too early.
[557.5s] And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew something bigger would come for Bitcoin.
[567.1s] I just started following all sorts of projects like Colored Coins, MasterCoin—things like that.
[574.8s] Until I found Ethereum.

[577.3s] I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.
[584.2s] People were still very active on Reddit.
[588.3s] Vitalik would answer questions personally.
[591.4s] And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit.

[597.0s] I'm a designer, not a coder, so I thought, "Hey, there are enough coders here.
[602.0s] Maybe the designer." And then someone would ask something for a presentation I could give them.

[607.9s] And then by the time the pre-sale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list.
[616.9s] So that's how I got...
[620.2s] I started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[624.1s] So you did not expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did.
[629.7s] You were just kind of...

**SPEAKER_06:**
[631.2s] Jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this?
[637.5s] I certainly didn't expect it to, like—sort of—yes and no.
[643.0s] Because I felt that back then, it seemed very obvious that Ethereum was going to be a big thing.
[648.1s] And I was like, "I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this."
[655.0s] I felt like telling everybody I knew, "Can't you see?
[658.9s] Look at this shit.
[659.9s] This is crazy.
[661.3s] It's like a blockchain with a computer inside."

[665.3s] And people were acting as if it was crazy.
[671.5s] I was a founder of a company back then.
[676.3s] I was doing an iPhone app.
[678.4s] It was sort of an Instagram for professionals, and I had raised money.
[684.0s] The app wasn't going anywhere.
[685.6s] And I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app.
[692.9s] I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.

[695.3s] And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this.
[698.2s] They were like, "Are you leaving the app
[701.1s] you founded to work for a 19-year-old? They're going to pay you in, like, made-up money that he invented?"
[706.4s] I was like, "Yeah, sure. That seems like a great idea."

[711.7s] Yeah, that—that's crazy man.
[715.0s] That's honestly the... I mean, just your... your

**SPEAKER_03:**
[720.9s] Your belief in what this could turn out to be ended up leading you to such success and being a pioneer in this space.
[730.8s] So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kind of helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team.
[738.1s] You explained you were part of the hiring and you brought Fabian [Vogelsteller] on board.
[743.2s] How did you go about getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team?
[747.9s] And what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[752.7s] So when I started working, the first person I started talking about working with was Gavin Wood.
[761.0s] Gavin Wood was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.
[768.8s] I didn't...
[770.4s] I would say that really the way I got to work was I downloaded what was the latest client, "cpp-ethereum," the C++ client...

[780.7s] (...) and the story goes on!
```

```plaintext
[1365.0s] gets a lot of votes to you because you basically pass an element that's a zero from function to function to function.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1371.9s] And if you can't get the contract, well, yes, you can approve, and the contracts can pull the tokens out of the element.

UNKNOWN:**
[1383.4s] It also is very, very good for tracking the balance of change.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1389.8s] The balance of change, you know,
[1393.0s] So it was pushing kind of thing.
[1395.3s] I don't see Alex's back, but being ready to pull parents out instead of pushing them is a lot better for tracking our unfair identity charges.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1407.8s] All right, let's see.
[1409.8s] All right, good.
[1411.0s] I'm back.
[1412.0s] All right, awesome.
[1413.8s] Yeah, so I don't even know where you left off.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1418.1s] Let's talk about tokens.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1419.7s] Yeah, tokens.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1422.8s] Am I the only one who heard

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1425.3s] who couldn't understand anything that Max said because he was very distorted or yeah, he was a bit distorted, I don't know what's going on with that. Um, okay, so yeah, so you were talking about, like, you know, Mastercoin and those types of projects and you had to, like, you know, release a whole token and stuff. I was just, I was asking more about, like, who decided to just, like,
[1454.8s] play with the Mist token and just, like, oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit.
[1459.8s] Well, that's what I'm getting at, right?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1461.9s] So we knew tokens were important.
[1463.7s] And then at some point, we decided, hey, we want to do a token release on Mist.
[1470.3s] And I posted on Reddit, like, hey, let's talk about the coin standard, let's talk about something. There was a very interesting conversation out of that. Based on that conversation, Fabian wrote the, wrote, like, the ERC standard. And when we released the...
[1492.1s] And then when we released the new Mist wallet, we wanted people to try it out because there were no tokens on Ethereum.
[1499.5s] There was nothing you could tokenize.
[1502.2s] So we basically released two tokens.

[1504.5s] One came with the wallet and was the unicorn thing.
[1507.5s] Whenever you donated to the foundation, you got a unicorn.
[1511.3s] And the other that we wanted people to be able to play with for free was just like something that Fabian Vogelsteller created.
[1519.6s] Literally for fun, just using, like, the standard thing that they had, and then just started giving it away on Reddit, just for people to try it out. Like, nobody, nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just, this is the best thing that we want to try out and want people to play around with.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1545.0s] Five, six months later though, right?
[1546.8s] Yeah.
[1549.1s] I mean, based on the contracts, I don't know if it was like, I didn't know.
[1552.9s] I don't know if it was, like, talked about internally, but not released until later.
[1557.5s] But yeah, it was released in 2016, a couple months...
[1561.3s] I think it was two or three months ago.
[1563.4s] And I think unicorns are great too, but I mean, I can't — they're very hard to get a hold of.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1570.6s] I mean, as you say, like, trust the timestamp, right?
[1574.6s] I mean, I, like, if you were asking me, I wouldn't swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.
[1584.8s] Maybe we hadn't, like...

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1586.7s] Yeah, I don't think you did, but the thing is that Unicorn is actually like an ERC-20—quote-unquote—actually an ERC-20, because Mist is basically an ERC-20 besides the approve function.
[1600.3s] So it was like, that's why, if you go look at the Unicorns...
[1606.1s] I'm pretty sure they have all of the ERC-20 standard implemented, whereas Mist is basically like the skeleton for it.
[1616.3s] It's just missing a few parts, or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20.
[1621.7s] But Fabian considers it.
[1624.4s] I think you had a good...
[1628.0s] Outlook on exactly how it met the standard and — besides the approval function.
[1633.4s] But yeah, that's super, super interesting.

[1638.0s] I was going to say, was there anyone else that kind of helped in —
[1642.2s] whether it be just ideating or actually getting in there and coding — because I know you said you weren't really a coder, that kind of helped with figuring out this ERC-20 standard?
[1653.6s] Or was it really just Fabian?
[1654.9s] I know you mentioned Gavin Wood.
[1657.1s] I didn't know if he was kind of in the coding side of things too, or was it really just Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1666.3s] Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community in regards to how to build the tokens.
[1674.0s] There were some projects that I think the guys from MakerDAO, I think Rune Christensen, was already participating in that.
[1683.8s] Rune from MakerDAO.
[1685.7s] He was already saying, look, we have this project.
[1689.3s] We already released a big number of tokens.
[1693.2s] They were claiming about other tokens that they were working on, on that project that they had.

[1700.4s] Of course, there was no standard for that.
[1702.6s] And that's sort of why we wanted, yeah, sure, you release a token, but that doesn't mean that we need a standard so that everyone can release tokens and those tokens can exist on wallets and things like that.
[1715.0s] So Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole community as a whole, like wrote the standard, and those things were a very participatory project, right?
[1730.7s] So this writing a standard is,
[1733.6s] by its design, something that you want to have the buy-in of the community; you want to have a lot of feedback so that everyone can, at some point, agree on something, right?

[1746.1s] So it's not something that you just come out and say, hey, this is how the foundation is going to do it.
[1750.9s] No, you want to hear it and you want to make sure that everyone is following the standard.
[1755.4s] Otherwise, it won't be a standard.
[1757.2s] It will just be a proprietary format.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1760.7s] Hmm.
[1761.4s] Yeah, that kind of leads me into my next question: did you believe ERC-20 would achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here 10 years later?
[1776.8s] Or did you expect a better or newer standard to come around?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[1781.1s] We knew that tokens were super important for Ethereum, right?
[1788.6s] Back when we were working on the Mist wallet...
[1791.5s] basically, all other crypto wallets served for, like, every other—especially every other Ethereum wallet—had one function in mind, which was you get the wallet, you got from the pre-sale, you get your Ether and you send it to an exchange to sell, right?
[1813.7s] Or you just bought something on an exchange and you send it to yourself.

[1817.5s] That was the only reason that anyone would use a wallet.

```txt
[2339.9s] Then at some point, we hit a wall in which creating a smart wallet would cost you $500 just to acquire a new user.
[2349.0s] We had to close down the company.
[2350.8s] But a lot of those, the ideas that I spent like two years talking about, going to conferences, and trying to share, are now finally, without me, becoming real.

[2367.7s] Because people are like,
[2369.8s] "Today, the word is account abstraction."
[2373.6s] And I think it's still one of the most important things to happen if we want blockchains to go mainstream: for users to never have to care about private keys again, where you just have a name,
[2390.0s] and that name is connected to multiple devices, and you basically use one device to allow access to the other, right?

[2403.2s] And I think we're probably reaching the moment where this will be able to be done, right?
[2408.0s] Because we have not only cheaper Layer 2s (L2s) that allow you to have more wallets, but it's also easier for deployers.
[2416.5s] They already have the address of a smart contract that can be deployed in all L2s at the same time.
[2424.0s] We have Passkeys, which is a crypto standard that is accepted by Android and Apple devices, which is really great for logging in.

[2438.0s] And I think that's something I'm very happy to see
[2446.1s] grow in crypto.
[2448.6s] Wow.
[2449.2s] I am proud of all the other achievements you mentioned.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2454.4s] No, yeah, that's actually really interesting because, um, I'm actually developing some stuff now, and my developer constantly talks to me about how big account abstraction is going to be for this next bull run, you know, bull run and stuff like that.
[2470.7s] And
[2471.4s] it's really fascinating to hear that you were actually working on something like this a few years ago. Was it?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[2478.6s] 2018 was the first time I even talked about that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2483.8s] I think you were just ahead of your time, to be honest.
[2488.6s] Because it's huge when it comes to onboarding
[2491.5s] new users—quote unquote "normies"—because, like, nobody wants to, you know, have to store their private key and worry about all that nonsense. And you were working on it back in 2018. It was just maybe the space hadn't matured enough then. And obviously it wasn't to a point where now it is. Damn, that sucks. I would really like to see, maybe, UniLogin make a comeback.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[2517.7s] I'm pretty sure all the things that we wanted it to function for will exist.
[2525.4s] I'm very happy to see them because I think it's super important in order for dapps to reach the mainstream that we want them to reach.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2534.8s] Yeah, no, that's great.
[2537.8s] Taking it a little bit back to the beginning again, what were your main challenges and considerations
[2546.7s] when it came to the Mist Wallet and the early development of it? Especially in relation to the fact that Ethereum was so early and was still evolving.
[2558.6s] What do you guys, you know, what do you think about that?
[2560.9s] What were your biggest, um, challenges and considerations you took into account when you were building?

**SPEAKER_06:**
[2571.1s] Oh, I think that,
[2574.9s] I think that is an interesting question that comes to the heart of what made us do the Mist Wallet, why it was doomed, and why it failed, right?

[2585.4s] One of the things we really wanted was, like—we sort of wanted to reinvent the way the web would work, and we really wanted to make sure that every user of the Mist Wallet was also a full node, right?
[2599.6s] By being a full node on Ethereum, it was also going to be
[2605.2s] a full node on Swarm, and every app there would be hosted on Swarm.
[2611.8s] We didn't even want it to be possible for you to connect to a traditional web, as you would call it.
[2619.9s] We didn't even want you to be able to connect to our website.
[2623.7s] The idea was that every app you load, if you load an ENS name, that would connect to a Swarm node,
[2634.5s] and then it would allow you to download your app directly from other Mist Wallet users, right?
[2642.1s] And also, you'd be running an Ethereum full node so that you were never dependent on anything, right?

[2650.1s] I mean, we were very, like—let's say—not very pragmatic about it, because the reality was that it worked for a few years in 2014, '15, and 2016.
[2662.1s] Back then, it was still technically possible for you to run a full node on your desktop. But the reality is that by 2017, when one of the first really big, major bull runs started happening, it would already take hours and hours to download and actually have the wallet work.

[2691.5s] And then almost everyone had already migrated to Metamask, which
[2693.9s] is just instant, right?
[2695.0s] You download it.
[2696.7s] You don't need to download a new browser.
[2700.7s] It connects directly to Etherscan, so you don't need to worry about a full node.
[2707.1s] It connects directly to the web, so you don't need to worry about storing web pages or anything like that.

[2714.1s] And in the end, that was, I think, one of the main reasons that
[2719.4s] Mist failed. We were sort of, like, giving too much in a way where we wanted everyone to run a full node
[2726.2s] and we wanted everyone to use a fully decentralized web.
[2731.4s] And that just wasn't possible back then.
[2732.9s] And, honestly, it’s still not possible today.
[2735.7s] And that is sort of how the whole project ended up with no users, and we had to shut it down.
[2743.8s] One of the main reasons.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[2745.1s] Yeah, that was one of my questions towards the end.
[2748.5s] I was going to ask why you guys actually decided to sunset.
[2752.9s] But that makes sense, because it is hard to get people to interact on that level.
[2760.2s] You have to create a node and make sure the node is running correctly and everything.
[2765.1s] That just kind of steers some of the less technical people away.

**SPEAKER_06:**
[2770.3s] We were able to abstract a lot of that technical side of creating a node.
[2775.7s] You didn’t know you were creating a node.
[2778.4s] You didn’t know you were creating anything like that.
[2780.2s] You were just uploading.
[2782.4s] But the problem with trying to abstract a lot of these technical aspects of design is that you can make a lot of things feel like magic—and that’s what we wanted to do.
[2792.9s] But there’s a point at which you hit a technical roadblock,
[2798.9s] and for most users, that was when we would tell them, "Look, it’s going to take five hours, six hours, or maybe a full week before you can even use this app," right?
[2811.6s] And there’s no way to abstract anything about that, right?

```plaintext
[3328.2s] And, you know, everybody put in the time or effort, and now they, you know, all feel kind of, you know, emotionally connected to that idea, you know?

[3337.0s] Yeah, no, that was a great question, Mud, especially as I'm dealing with that stuff on my own building.

[3343.5s] It's really nice to hear something like that.

[3347.1s] Can you hear me now?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3348.6s] I think we have time for one last question.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3352.9s] Okay, one last question.
[3355.4s] Can you hear me now?
[3356.6s] Yeah, yeah, we can hear you.
[3359.2s] Do you want to ask the final question?
[3361.0s] Go ahead, go ahead.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[3363.4s] I'll be just quick.
[3366.2s] So I think you mentioned, Alex, that there was a lot of attempts to do essentially on-chain wallets and stuff.
[3376.9s] I know that the ETHSwarm team was working quite early on, like Daniel Nagy and some other guys like Ido Shadran, on an on-chain wallet called GetLoginETH.
[3389.1s] Were you familiar with that one? It wasn't that early, but it was something that I also came across and did a little bit of work on probably two years ago.

[3397.6s] And second small question, the Parity wallet came out just after the Mist wallet. Was that in an attempt to solve the issue with syncing the whole node? Because I remember there were statements that they would try and run that on, like, a light client and only sync part of the chain.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3418.7s] I worked with Daniel Nagy—if that's the same person. He was also on ETHSwarm. I don't remember his work on GetLoginETH; that's interesting. Not sure what you mean by "on-chain wallet."

[3429.5s] About the Parity light client thing, since I was working with you, there were always claims that, like, "This light client sync or this new light client sync is going to be the one that solves all light client problems," right?

[3447.9s] We tried a lot of them, and I still don't think there's, to this day, a very good way to really have a fully decentralized light client that can just connect to the blockchain, right?

[3482.3s] First of all, because it's hard to do, and often—and that's even sadder—often the user doesn't really care. That's also a big problem, always.

[3495.2s] Often the user... If you say, "Look, instead of taking one gigabyte or 10 gigabytes, this thing is going to take 100 megabytes," the user asks, "Why do I want to use this 100 megabytes if I can just connect to Etherscan or whatever?"

[3515.6s] And that's never good enough for the user.

[3523.3s] So yeah, "the user didn't care" is an epitaph for a thousand decentralized projects everywhere.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[3531.4s] Awesome. Thank you for answering that.
[3533.7s] I tagged you in the comment with the repo that I was talking about. And yes, it was Daniel Nagy from ETHSwarm.
[3538.7s] I did a bit of work with them two years ago.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3543.6s] Alex, I got one question for you, just so you have time to plug what you're working on.
[3549.0s] I saw that you're working on a new project called The High Order Company.
[3553.4s] Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, what the goals are, and just talk about what you're currently working on?
[3559.5s] After that, I just appreciate your time and stuff.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3563.9s] Sure.
[3565.0s] I am working on two fronts.

[3567.6s] I am working a lot on ENS, on meta-governance for ENS and for DAOs in general. I think it's super important to think about governance. And I still think that one of the main impacts that blockchain can have today is to establish decentralized companies or organizations where all the funds are trackable and everything is transparent.

[3589.3s] And I'm very proud to see that ENS is, I would say, one of the best examples of that.

[3595.5s] The second thing I'm working on—and this is with one of the smartest people I've worked with during my time at the Ethereum Foundation—is with a guy named Victor Maia. He goes by Victor Thielen now.

[3619.3s] He worked on the Mist wallet, and I would often ask him to do a task, like, "Hey, can you integrate this library with Swarm for a bit?" Three days later, he would say, "Yeah, the work is done, but I need some more time because I found an upstream bug in the library."

[3636.5s] Then three days later, he would say, "I fixed the library, but I think the library is taking the wrong approach. Give me a few days—I'm going to make a new library for that." And then a few days later, he would say, "I've created a new library, but I think the real problem is that Mist is using the wrong thing. We should really refactor Mist as a whole to do this thing."

[3656.7s] At some point, I joked to him, "Look, Victor, I can't give you more time. I know that if you had all the time in the world, you would just want to build a whole new computer." And he was like, "Yeah, you're right."

[3674.9s] Well, guess what? Victor has all the time in the world now, and he's actually building a new computer.

[3680.7s] He's been studying computer science history, and he found a way to create virtual computers that are much more parallel, that execute faster, and a lot of things like that. I think it is fantastic, and it's one of those things that is very hard to communicate what they are doing. But I think they are doing something that is going to be big.

[3722.3s] We are working on a new website. It's going to be very cool. You're going to be able to see some animations.

[3729.3s] In essence, we are all using Turing Machines. And he's like, "Look, Turing Machines are wrong. There are better ways to do it."

[3737.6s] Instead of having the concept of a Turing Machine, which is like a little robot with an infinite tape that goes back and forth and changes the tape from zero to one, he's able to turn any sort of computation into basically a planar graph with a thousand lines.

[3758.1s] And those lines have, like, four little commands that they can do. And they can do it all at the same time. So you can run it in 16 cores simultaneously. It just becomes a very easy way to transform any computation into something multi-core all the time.

[3777.0s] So yeah, you should—if you think this sounds interesting—definitely follow the HVM page.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3784.6s] How do I profit? How do I invest in this?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3789.9s] Well, you should follow us. If you want to be a pioneer yourself, maybe you can participate in some way, right?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3799.9s] I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would. Is that The High Order Company or something else?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3808.2s] Yeah, definitely.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3808.9s] Okay. I'm definitely going to check that out and do some research, because that sounds amazing. It sounds like the guy you got on board is definitely one of those genius pioneers you don't come across very often.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3820.7s] Yeah, you should definitely follow him.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3824.7s] Yeah, I'm going to look into that. I really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here. Maybe we could do it again sometime, because I still have, like, 20 other questions I want to ask you. And I know there are other people here too that wanted to come up, but it's been about an hour and I don't want to take too much of your time.
[3842.4s] So thank you so much. I really, truly appreciate it.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3849.3s] Well, thank you for the invitation. It was fun to have this conversation.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[3852.5s] Yeah, man. Have a good day. We'll probably stay on for a little bit and chat it up, so you're more than welcome to head out and do whatever you got to do.

[3864.1s] Thanks, man.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
[3866.5s] Thank you, everyone. Have a good one. Bye.

[4227.9s] Yeah, it's me, but well, there is a tool in Base called Base Migrate, so everybody is free to do that.
[4233.8s] It's very simple.
[4234.8s] It's just two or three steps, and you have a tutorial developed by the Base guys, so everybody is free to do the same with any Ethereum mainnet token.
[4244.8s] It just takes 30 minutes to do the whole process, and later on, five, six days to have the pull request in GitHub approved.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[4254.8s] Yeah, I actually was speaking on the earlier space.
[4259.1s] I was saying how Base is really, really popping off and how L2s have made it really, really easy for, I mean, lots of different use cases.
[4273.5s] But surely we don't need liquidity.
[4277.5s] We only need liquidity of MIST tokens if they want to bridge back from Base to Ethereum.
[4287.3s] It depends on how the bridge is set up, but if you're bridging from Ethereum mainnet to Base, you essentially are minting a new token on the Base side.
[4298.5s] In that way, you can basically... it's ready for you. So anybody who wants to bridge from Ethereum just bridges it and mints the new token on Base.
[4308.3s] But obviously bridging it back from Base to Ethereum would require more liquidity. Yeah, I think it locks up. It locks up that MIST and that's why it's only one specific bridge. I don't think there's multiple bridges.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[4325.6s] If you lock your MIST in that contract, it mints the Base token, and then you put that Base back in there, and it unlocks the MIST, whatever amount it was and stuff like that.
[4337.4s] So, yeah, the supply can only be as high as how many people locked up in that initial ETH bridge.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[4344.7s] Yeah, so the liquidity is just there.
[4347.2s] We want liquidity just in case we want to bridge back from Base.
[4350.2s] So anybody who has MIST, you can just go ahead and bridge across it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4355.1s] Yes, I was referring just to the liquidity in Uniswap, just in case you want to do some swaps from Ethereum on Base to MIST on Base.
[4363.7s] Just that. As I was saying, I mean, you don't need liquidity on both sides to make the bridge work in such a way that once you bridge one token from mainnet to the Base side, I mean, it's like frozen, it's like locked.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[4376.7s] Yeah, I mean...
[4378.2s] We need more liquidity providers, is what you're saying.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4381.8s] Okay, I have a suggestion, right?
[4384.0s] What does everybody think about maybe, because, you know, there's meme mania right now.
[4393.2s] And people are throwing their money at all types of, I mean, pretty much bullshit, right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4399.4s] Mm-hmm.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4399.7s] And this narrative that we're looking at right now, we're dealing with, is pretty much like... I mean, it sells itself.
[4406.2s] I'm just speaking from an investor standpoint, right?
[4409.3s] So if liquidity is the goal, what does everybody think about maybe us ourselves, instead of waiting for, like, the Doge unlocking that 50K? That'll be good.
[4425.2s] But instead of waiting, or while we wait on that...
[4429.5s] I mean, something that we could maybe possibly do if everybody's up for it.
[4432.6s] Maybe we could start, I don't know, maybe our own token or something, deploy it.
[4440.7s] Some of us add some liquidity to that, get it up off the ground.
[4444.4s] But X-Token has the sole and explicit purpose of, I don't know, maybe bringing more attention to MIST itself and the Relic meta itself.
[4458.7s] And maybe, I don't know, a portion of...
[4464.2s] fees generated or money made can go explicitly to providing liquidity to the pool.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[4476.8s] Yeah.
[4478.0s] I mean, it's interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4479.0s] I mean, I think a lot of... You know, just something. Because, you know, we can take advantage of the fact that there's so many people, especially on this new chain, Base, that are just buying whatever the hell.
[4494.1s] This is actually...
[4494.9s] I mean, just...
[4496.5s] I don't know how the mechanics would work, but essentially, that's how the experience would go.
[4501.9s] Like, we're all in on it.
[4503.3s] We know what's up.
[4504.0s] We're already...
[4505.0s] doing what we can.
[4505.9s] I see a few of us are already, like, reposting stuff and posting memes and doing what we can to, you know, get it out there and get attention and market it.
[4513.1s] And that's, like, amazing.
[4515.6s] But just an idea, you know, just so we can get some new money in and we can actually use that for something.
[4521.8s] And as a community, we all agree.
[4523.5s] You know what I mean?
[4524.7s] Full transparency, no rug bullshit.
[4527.3s] I don't know.
[4527.7s] Just something.
[4528.9s] Maybe it sounds gimmicky, but I don't know.
[4531.9s] Sometimes gimmicks work, and, you know, people always want to put their money in things.
[4535.9s] So that's just where my head was at.

**SPEAKER_05:**
[4538.3s] I would just caution against creating a new token willy-nilly because, you know...
[4543.7s] A lot of people forget there's a lot of legal things that come into it, you know.
[4549.1s] So, like, you could kind of say you're just splintering liquidity.
[4553.7s] Yes. No, not just that — it's regulation, right?
[4557.3s] To launch a token, like, the proper way, you have to make sure that, like, you, you know, understand the legalities in different jurisdictions.
[4565.6s] And a lot of people just don't do this because they're like, "whatever," you know.
[4571.3s] But, you know, it can really come back and bite you in the ass if, you know, like, hey, you launched a token.
[4580.5s] And then, you know, the SEC comes knocking or, you know...

[5113.7s] know stated that it is a, uh, what do you call it, commodity in the past. They're trying to say that MetaMask and other wallets are, uh, broker—broker, uh, what's it called—a broker-dealer, which is absolutely insane. They're kind of just—the terminology for broker-dealer is just, um, not good enough. Yeah, I think everybody should go look that up right now. Yeah.

[5139.0s] They're basically hanging off the definition of facilitation.

[5143.0s] So they're saying, "Oh, but it facilitates."

[5147.5s] But the fact is, it's an application, and it can't execute without you pushing a button.

[5158.4s] So, in the same sense that they're calling it a facilitator, you can say that, "Oh, OK, cool.

[5163.7s] Well, Apple and Windows and Microsoft
[5168.7s] should also be in this, you know—what do you call it—court case because they're also facilitating these things. They're facilitating in the same way that MetaMask is. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about, I wouldn't worry about, like, uh, you know, regulations for, uh, a token like a bridge token because

[5189.4s] the onus is that the origin is the Mist.
[5194.6s] And none of us here are the creator of Mist.

[5198.6s] And that would basically just be like opening up,
[5202.6s] making a case against a token that has already gone through the rigmarole. So, you know, I don't think we worry about a wild precedent. Yeah, every single bridge token would also need to then doubly kind of, like, prove itself, which is ridiculous. Um, but I like the idea of

[5224.9s] an extra kind of—almost like a marketing campaign, like an onboarding campaign.
[5231.0s] I'm going to also think about it and chat to you, AC."

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5234.6s] I think we have the power to do it with the amount of people that are already interested in Mist because of just the whole relic meta thing.
[5246.2s] It's not just about price go up.

[5248.7s] I think the biggest thing that attracted me to it was just not the marketability of Mist itself due to its provenance, history, and associations.

[5260.5s] How I'm literally, in real time, seeing OGs, like ETH OGs, kind of like double back. Like, cause it's like—it’s kind of like—it's like a callback to, like, the original community, you know, before the 2021 blow-off top, before meme coin mania, before Solana, before all that shit. Like the OG feel, like how it was back in the day, like,

[5290.1s] people have something that they can actually call back to.
[5292.6s] Literally, it's called a callback in writing. Or, if anybody writes screenplays or anything like that, or has anything to do with entertainment, a callback is kind of like—or, like, in a joke, a callback is, like, you know, you're literally referring back to something—

[5308.2s] something else that was said. I feel like Mist is kind of like a callback to a time, you know what I mean? Like a vibe on Ethereum that people can actually see. That—the timestamp thing—it’s super, super, super smart. I don't know who came up with that, but that's really good. That's—that's—that's really good. Even, even, uh—even it embodies what I'm trying to get across. Even Alex said that. And Alex is like—Alex is like—

**SPEAKER_03:**
[5335.1s] like, I'm not FUDing or anything like that, but Alex is like—he’s still kind of like just blown back at what Mist has become. He did not expect it to get to this point, which is fine. You know, he was just building and he ended up building something great. You're trying to give him the flowers, bro, and he was like, "No, no." He's—he's just a—he's what he is. He's just like a humble—he's just a builder.

[5360.0s] Yeah, he's a good guy. I've had a couple, like,
[5364.2s] conversations with him outside of the space.
[5368.2s] He wants to build and make good things.

[5372.4s] The whole unicorn—that's one token I will talk about because he brought it up.
[5374.7s] The unicorn token is super cool.
[5376.4s] Really, really super cool.
[5378.7s] But it's impossible to get your hands on.
[5388.9s] That would be potentially something that would be really, really cool to give as a reward or something if you locked up some Mist.

[5397.5s] And then also, it kind of gives us a bit of leeway when it comes to litigation because we didn't start these tokens.
[5404.5s] We're just—
[5405.5s] giving them out.
[5406.7s] You know what I'm saying?
[5407.5s] Like we didn't actually, you know, launch these tokens.

...

[5470.6s] The fact that liquidity pools could be made, and anybody could trade any token and doesn't really need much liquidity behind it, that was huge.
[5479.7s] And that was just created in 2020.
