SPEAKER_00: Okay, I think we are live.

SPEAKER_01: Live us.

SPEAKER_00: Let's just give a minute for people to join.

SPEAKER_01: Alrighty.

SPEAKER_02: So I looked at the background noise reduction. It says not supported in this browser. I'm using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_01: You must pick from the two available choices.

SPEAKER_00: Safari. Yeah, Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone.

SPEAKER_01: Is it called Edge still?

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_02: Nobody uses Edge. Nobody uses it.

SPEAKER_01: I bet you it's a lot. Hold on.

SPEAKER_02: I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember if it was on Edge or Bing or probably both, but the most searched thing was how to install Chrome.

SPEAKER_01: That's funny. Try though. They might. Wow. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Yeah, they're just pretty tiny. Wow. Opera is still around. That's amazing.

SPEAKER_02: They all use Chromium though.

SPEAKER_01: Okay, fair enough.

SPEAKER_00: Oddly, my son uses Opera. Okay, we are live now on Twitter.

SPEAKER_01: Live. Live.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, so should we wait another minute or should we just start?

SPEAKER_01: That's a good question. We can ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute-long non sequiturs, cold opens?

SPEAKER_00: Well, maybe we should do our intros because we—

SPEAKER_01: Okay, we could do the intros. So—

SPEAKER_00: Hi everyone. Welcome to our weekly show. If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercada project that is a Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now, we, the three of us here, are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I'm Victor Wong. Vic.

SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe—

SPEAKER_00: Someone else to bestow that.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, you two. No, you—

SPEAKER_02: Can we say it to each other?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Can we say you are an OG?

SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I said that as a—

SPEAKER_01: Collection in a circle.

SPEAKER_00: Right, exactly.

SPEAKER_01: You can tell Bob, Bob's an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you.

SPEAKER_00: Yes. So we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get hopefully no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. Today we are going to talk about the highlights from Token2049 and was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwill. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

SPEAKER_02: Hi there, I'm Bob Summerwill. We are all—we're not old, we're all very experienced. But yes, I'm Head of Ecosystem.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And Kieran, of course.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I am also experienced. You know, not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it. Right? Like we've really been around for some time. But yes, I'm—

SPEAKER_00: I will bestow the OG title on you, Kieran. So we could go—I mean, anyone that's been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, that would be—we can claim that title.

SPEAKER_01: How the time goes.

SPEAKER_00: So I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kind of played hooky with Kieran's approval. You know, international travel is brutal, but Bob and Kieran were there. And I want to get your kind of impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at Token2049?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished. And there was a lot of that the previous year.

SPEAKER_00: Can I pour one out for the meme coins?

SPEAKER_01: Basically, in meme coins' defense, I'm actually kind of pro-meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon that people want to make money in, like, seconds. Like, I think if a meme around a concept can kind of grow organically for some period of time, it's great.

SPEAKER_02: But—

SPEAKER_01: But yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But maybe not this one. So the conference felt kind of less scammy in general. And a lot of digital asset treasury talk—I think we can go into that as we go. A lot of stablecoin talk, a lot of merger with TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed. And I can't tell if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content or something's qualitatively different about the world. Where like a year ago it felt like crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world. And now it feels like it's a big part of the solution. It's very strange. And everyone sort of acknowledges that. You know, like Donald Trump Jr. was there. Like, that's a big changeover where you just feel—some weeks ago, Putin made his comments about how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true. But it's like—that's a big turnaround. It's like a from-the-top policy as opposed to just—and you felt that at the conference as well.

SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, that wasn't new on the Bitcoin conference side. So I was in Nashville 2023 and then this July in Vegas. So in Nashville last year you had Trump, RFK Jr. Then this year you had both Trump boys—Ben Jr. and Eric were both there. And oh my goodness, I'm forgetting his name from the UK. It will come to me in a second. But yeah, and also tons of other Congress people and state-level stuff. Like that's been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side. I mean, I guess essentially because you've just already got that monetary store-of-value use case. It's like getting into these boring ETF, treasury company, government-level adoption sort of stuff. That's happened earlier on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah, also, I mean obviously the Trumps have got their World Liberty nonsense going on and gotta be pumping that one.

SPEAKER_00: Well, actually that's a good transition. So you know, we couldn't—internally we were trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You kind of have talked about the boring elements, I guess, you know, more institutional. And I'm curious, like, since this is in Singapore, a very global conference, what countries outside the U.S. seem to be moving in this direction? You know, like obviously the U.S. has been a holdout for a really long time, but how are things getting boring and how are things getting more global?
