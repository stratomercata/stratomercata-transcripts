**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. I think we are live.

**[00:02] SPEAKER_01:** Live? Us?

**[00:03] SPEAKER_00:** Let's just give a minute for people to join.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** Alrighty.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_02:** So I looked at the background noise reduction that says are not supported in this browser. I'm using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

**[00:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. You must pick from the two available choices.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_00:** Safari. It'd be great. Yeah. Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_01:** Is it called Edge still? Yes. Yes. Nobody uses Edge. Nobody. Nobody uses it. I bet you it's a lot. Hold on.

**[00:26] SPEAKER_02:** I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember who was on Edge or Bing or probably both, but the most searched thing was how to install Chrome.

**[00:33] SPEAKER_01:** That's funny. Try though they might—wow. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Yeah. They're just pretty tiny. Wow. Opera is still around. That's amazing.

**[00:47] SPEAKER_02:** They all use Chromium now.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. Fair enough. Oddly, my son uses Opera. Okay. We are live now on Twitter. Live. Live. Okay. So should we wait another minute, or should we just start?

**[00:58] SPEAKER_01:** That's a good question. We could ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute-long non sequiturs? Cold opens?

**[01:04] SPEAKER_00:** Well, maybe we should do our intros because we—okay. We could do the intros. So hi, everyone. Welcome to our weekly show. If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercado project that is a layer one EVM-compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now, the three of us here are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I'm Victor Wong.

**[01:25] SPEAKER_01:** Vic, I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe it. Someone has to bestow that.

**[01:30] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly. Okay. You two are OGs.

**[01:32] SPEAKER_01:** Can we say it to each other?

**[01:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Can we say it to each other? You can tell Bob. Bob's an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you. Yes. So, you know, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. And today, we are going to talk about the highlights from Token 2049. And was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwell. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

**[02:01] SPEAKER_02:** Hi there. I'm Bob Summerwell. We are all—we're not old. We're all very experienced.

**[02:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Thank you.

**[02:07] SPEAKER_02:** But yes, I'm head of ecosystem.

**[02:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And Karen, of course.

**[02:11] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I am also experienced. You know, not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it. Right? Like, we've really been around for some time.

**[02:19] SPEAKER_00:** But yes, I will bestow the OG title on you, Karen.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you.

**[02:23] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, anyone that's been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, we can claim that title.

**[02:30] SPEAKER_01:** How the time goes.

**[02:31] SPEAKER_00:** So I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kinda played hooky with current approval. You know, international travel is brutal. But Bob and Karen were there, and I wanted to get your impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at Token 2049?

**[02:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished, and there was a lot of that the previous year.

**[02:53] SPEAKER_00:** Can I pour one out for the meme coins, basically?

**[02:55] SPEAKER_01:** In meme coins' defense, I'm actually kind of pro meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon that people want to make money in—like, seconds. I think if a meme around a concept can grow organically for some period of time, it's great. But yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But maybe not this one. So the conference felt kinda less scammy in general. A lot of digital asset treasury talk—we can go into that as we go. A lot of stablecoin talk. A lot of merger with TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed, and I can't tell if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content or something's qualitatively different about the world. Where, like, a year ago, it felt like crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world, and now it feels like it's a big part of the solution. It's very strange. And everyone sort of acknowledged that. You know, like, Donald Trump Jr. was there. That's a big change. Some weeks ago, Putin made his comments about how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true. But it's a big turnaround. It's like a from-the-top policy as opposed to just fringe, and you felt that at the conference as well.

**[04:01] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I mean, that wasn't new on the Bitcoin conference side. So I was in Nashville 2023 and then this July in Vegas. So in Nashville last year, you had Trump, RFK Jr. Then this year, you had both Trump boys—Don Jr. and Eric—were both there. And oh my goodness, I'm forgetting his name from the UK. It'll come to me in a second. But yeah. And also, tons of other congresspeople and state-level folks. That's been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side. I mean, I guess essentially because you've already got that monetary store-of-value use case, it's getting into these boring ETF, treasury company, government-level adoption sort of stuff. That happened earlier on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah. Also, obviously, the Trumps have got their World Liberty nonsense going on and gotta be pumping that one.

**[04:47] SPEAKER_00:** Well, actually, that's a good transition. So internally, we were kind of trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You've kind of talked about the boring elements—more institutional. And I'm curious, since this is in Singapore, a very global conference, what countries outside the US seem to be moving in this direction? Obviously, the US has been a holdup for a really long time. But how are things getting boring, and how are things getting more global?

**[05:13] SPEAKER_01:** Bob, I want to remind you not to criticize our friends in Washington, at least in a public forum. Supporters of the—yeah. Yeah. The power. I'm not getting back in.

**[05:21] SPEAKER_00:** So...

**[05:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So it's an interesting feel, the conference. I would say it obviously represented people who are close by pretty well, but also some good number of people in from, let's say, UAE, some Europe, plenty of Americans who did the really long trip. Lots of Americans, I would say. And yeah, I think the institutional feeling was much stronger than the prior year. And it's not that much time to have passed. Stablecoins have this institutional feel to them—even at the beginning, they didn't. And it is funny to watch these announcements, like Tether's coming to the US, and we've set up a nice regulatory framework they can work with. I went to a side event and met some of the Tether people. It's also just funny to see them in the media, like buying sports teams and all of that. At a certain point, you get big enough, you become institutional. Right? I think even last year, it felt like blockchain technology at the lower levels of the stack disproportionately gets created in the broader West, maybe with the exception of some of the exchanges and such, and it gets used outside the West more. So you see stablecoin balances—yes, they're big in the US, but it's really a global story. Tether, in particular, being much larger than Circle. Obviously, I think both of them—Tether purports not to serve the US. I'm sure there's plenty of US USDT holders. Circle may be preferencing the US but probably covers global as well. It's a funny feeling in which the people at the conference are a little more like users than builders. Someone described Token to me kind of like Comic-Con, and I thought that was actually very apt. There were people in funny outfits—you could take a picture as an astronaut with Justin Sun. Lots of mascots. I think the world's tallest man was there—sadly in a wheelchair. I think he has a hard time standing for long periods. I saw this horse in a wheelchair and thought, no, that's a human. A really large human being—like 8'6" or 7'10" or something. He probably has to be in a wheelchair just so he doesn't bump his head on every doorframe out there. So yeah, the mix is definitely a big global conference. They usually get around 20,000 people. Coming from hubs—again, a lot of UAE, some of the European hubs, and a big US contingent. Very long flight for us. But yeah, it was great. Singapore is also just a great place to hang out and a pretty good representation of the global scene. There's also a feeling that the same people are manning the booths last year to this year. I've also heard it's a very expensive conference, but the companies have in many cases changed, except for the very big ones—the headliners, people invited to the stage, etc. A lot of turnover in who was represented at the conference. So in some ways, being a media company is one of the better ways to survive cycles in crypto.

**[08:10] SPEAKER_00:** Just someone will pay that big conference fee. Yeah. And it seems those fees are getting bigger and bigger too. Right? That's just very, very expensive.

**[08:17] SPEAKER_01:** I got a... garbage?

**[08:18] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. So yeah, we don't want to keep you too long. Obviously, you've got important things to do around the house. Bob, what do you think about the global and the boring part of it?

**[08:27] SPEAKER_02:** So yeah. I mean, I guess just something else to say is I have been to a lot of conferences. I've never seen somewhere with so much floor space of expo halls. Just on and on and on—honestly, like city blocks. Many, many city blocks worth of stuff. And then you go, alright, there's another whole floor of this. Yeah. It's twice as much as you thought.

**[08:45] SPEAKER_00:** Even bigger than Zeppelin in Thailand last year? Because I remember getting my step tracker and seeing, oh man, I did 15,000 steps in the conference center.

**[08:52] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, in terms of the expo area, certainly. DEFCON was a large floor area, but it was lots and lots of different rooms of talks and then little stores, whereas this is just expo hall of selling. I don't know what most of them were. Thousands and thousands of projects that you've never heard of doing a thing that is pretty indistinguishable from everybody else. So yeah, talking about the turnover, Karen, I'm sure that's the case. The vast majority of them are going to be gone in a year's time and you'll never even know they happened.
