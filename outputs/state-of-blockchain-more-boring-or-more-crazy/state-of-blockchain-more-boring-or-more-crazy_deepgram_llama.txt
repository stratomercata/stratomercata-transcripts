SPEAKER_00: Okay. I think we are live.

SPEAKER_01: Live? Us?

SPEAKER_00: Let's just give a minute for people to join.

SPEAKER_01: Alrighty.

SPEAKER_02: So I looked at the background noise reduction that says are not supported in this browser. I'm using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

SPEAKER_01: Yes. You you must pick from the two available choices.

SPEAKER_00: Safari. It'd be great. Yeah. Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone.

SPEAKER_01: Is is Edge is it called Edge still? Yes. Yes. Nobody uses Edge. Nobody. Nobody uses it. I bet you it's a lot. Hold on.

SPEAKER_02: I I I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember who was on Edge or Bing or probably both, but the most searched thing was how to install Chrome.

SPEAKER_01: That's funny. Try though they might wow. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Yeah. They're just pretty tiny. Wow. Opera is still around. That's amazing.

SPEAKER_02: They all use Chromium now. Okay. Fair enough.

SPEAKER_00: Oddly, son uses Opera. Okay. We are live now in Twitter. Live. Live. Okay. So should we should we wait another minute, or should we just start?

SPEAKER_01: That's a good question. We could we could ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute long non sequiturs? Cold opens.

SPEAKER_00: Well, maybe we should do our intros because we we We could okay. We we could do the intros. So hi, everyone. Welcome to our week show. If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercado project that is a layer one EVM compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now we the three of us here are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I'm Victor Wong.

SPEAKER_01: Vic, I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe it. Someone has to bestow that. Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. You two are OGs. No. You Can we say it to each other? Yeah. Can we say it to each an OG,

SPEAKER_01: but but, yeah, we I I said that as a collective circle.

SPEAKER_00: Right. Exactly. So You can tell Bob. Bob's an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you. Yes. So, you know, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're gonna talk about today. And today, we are going to talk about the highlights from token $20.49. And is was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwell. Bob, you wanna do a quick intro?

SPEAKER_02: Hi there. I'm Bob Summerwell. We are all we're not old. We're all very experienced.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Thank you.

SPEAKER_02: But, yes, I'm I'm head of ecosystem.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And Karen, of course.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I am also experienced you know, not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it. Right? Like, we've really been around for some time.

SPEAKER_00: But, yes, I'm I I will bestow the OG title on you, Karen. So Oh, thank could go I mean, I mean, anyone that's been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, that would be we we can we can claim that title.

SPEAKER_01: How the time goes?

SPEAKER_00: So I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kinda played hooky with current approval. You know, international travel is brutal. But Bob and Karen were there, and I wanted to get your kind of impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at token twenty forty nine?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished, and there was a lot of that the previous year.

SPEAKER_00: And Can I pour one out for the meme coins, basically?

SPEAKER_01: In meme coins defense, I'm actually kind of pro meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon that peep people wanna make money in, like, seconds. Like, I I think if a meme around a concept, if it can kinda grow organically for some period of time, is is, like, great. But but, yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But may maybe maybe not this one. So conference felt kinda less scammy in general. And lot of digital asset treasury talk, I think we can go into that as we go. Lot of stable coin talk. You know, a lot of, you know, merger with TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed, and I I can't tell, like, if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content or or something's qualitatively different about the world. Where, like, a year ago, it felt like the crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world, and now it feels like it's, a big part of the solution. It's very strange. And and everyone sort of acknowledged that, you know, like, Donald Trump junior Donald Trump junior was there. Like, that's a big change over where you just feel, you know, it like, some some weeks ago, like, Putin made his comments about, like, how The United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true. But it's it's like, that's a big turnaround. It's like a from the top policy as opposed to just and you felt that at the conference as well.

SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, that that wasn't new on the on the Bitcoin conference side. So I was in Nashville 2014 and Vegas sorry. 2014, twenty twenty twenty twenty four, and then and then this July in Vegas. So in Nashville last year, you had Trump, RFK junior. Then this year, you had both Trump boys. Don Junior and Eric were both there. And oh my goodness. I'm forgetting his name from The UK. They they will come to me in a second. But yeah. And and I also, you know, like, tons of other congress people and state level stuff. Like, that's been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side. I mean, I guess, essentially, because you've just already got that monetary store value use case. It's like getting into these boring ETF, you know, treasury company, government level adoption sort of stuff. That that's happened earlier than on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah. Also, I mean, obviously, like, the Trumps have got their world liberty nonsense going on and gotta be pumping that one.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I actually, that's a good transition. So, you know, we couldn't internally, were kind trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You you kind of have talked about the boring elements, I guess, you know, more institutional. And I'm curious, like, you know, since this is in Singapore, a very global conference, like, what countries outside The US seem to be moving in this direction? You know, like, obviously, The US has been a holdup for a really long time. But, you know, how are things getting boring, and how are things getting more global?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I think it's a strange thing in which, like, the meme meme coins ended to some degree with the US elections and, like, I feel like Libra was really the end, you know, in which, you know, the a coin associated with a public official did pretty badly for the the people involved. Excuse me.

SPEAKER_00: And Sorry. I I thought you were talking about the Facebook

SPEAKER_01: Libra. No. No. No. Yeah. The the But you mean the The Malay associated meme. Malay associated. Got it. Gotcha. There's a coin as well, wasn't there? Yeah. I think it was before, though. I feel like that was not the end to end. But but, yes, it's sort of, you know, I I think they've kinda peaked. It pumped up funds still seems to be doing lots and lots of launches in revenue, but I just no one is really talking that much about it anymore. And we're getting back to something like, you either have to have tech or now you have to have revenue. And it's gotten, you know, almost like a mirror of the public equity markets in which people are, you know I I I something I like, when I talk at more length another time, I keep seeing criticism of, say, Uniswap because they generate a lot of fees. But a lot of those fees go directly to the lab company, and they don't go to the protocol or and they they have to turn the protocol fees on and would then start theoretically buying back the token. Whereas folks like Hyperliquid, there's no lab skim, and there are pretty big buybacks going on. And the token price has gone up and, you know, people argue, Uniswap has a kind of conflict of interest there. But, anyway, the to the point being, like, suddenly, all became about, like, revenue, US dollar denominated yields, like, how to do not quite a SPAC. Like, most of these treasury companies are an existing public traded pub publicly traded company, and there's, you know, maybe not a formal takeover with a change of control, but usually, like, in an injection of capital that the company is doing something else right now, and then it starts digital asset treasury operations. You know, like, there there's panel Tom Lee gave a lot of, like, numbers on how big his digital asset treasury company is, what chunk of ETH it holds, you know, now, what the trend is, all that sort of thing. And they've I guess Michael Saylor kinda pioneered I don't know if he was there. I don't think he was. Some of the financial engineering that kind of creatively let him acquire as much Bitcoin as possible, and all these folks are then kind of in the I would argue, like, a part part of the mindset, people make complicated products that sort of favor the house in a sense. Yeah. So that, you know, no matter what, like, the client has an idea, but the the institution does okay. Right? And some analog of that is going on. You know, people are purchasing. Like, a lot of the time, you would just want to hold tokens directly as opposed to invest in a digital assets treasury. I guess, I I think the digital asset treasury is maybe better than the ETFs. The ETFs promise to do nothing and charge a fee where the digital asset treasuries don't really charge a fee and maybe do something creative. So, you know, it's like it's the entrance of a new venue of financial engineering, but I I also think they're kinda brilliant in the following sense. It's a tremendous pain to be a public traded, say, US company. It's expensive. There's a lot of compliance burden and so on. Tokens are out there. They get liquidity in in some ways. You might want liquidity from The US public equity markets for your token. You could do this by IPO ing a company. Like, Coinbase is sort of a vehicle for that. But then you gotta, like, report on the extremely complicated, no doubt operations of Coinbase, and it's whatever thousand employees and, you know, all that. Or you could just have a thing by the token, and then you, like, never have to IPO the labs company. And you can kind of just get all of the capital without the much heavier reporting burden of being a publicly traded actual company. And this is, like, kind of genius. Like, the it's a a great way to bring in more kind of bigger, more boring, more conservative capital while not changing the premise that much. So so, yeah, it's gotten the suits are good at that. You know? And the digital asset treasuries provide a good wrapper for the, you know, thing that probably most of us would hold as spot.

SPEAKER_00: By the way, we have a comment from who says he loves your take on meme ecosystems. Yeah. Yeah. Not surprisingly. Somebody has their own meme ecosystem.

SPEAKER_01: You got a hold of the memes. That's the key. Shout out to you, Sheba.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Bob, what so what do you think about, you know, treasuries and stablecoins?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I mean, I guess just something else to say that is I have been to a lot of conferences. I've never seen so somewhere with so much floor space of expo halls. Just on and on and on, like, honestly, like, city blocks, many, many city blocks worth of of stuff. You know? And then you you you go, alright. Yeah. There's another whole floor of this. Yeah. Yeah. It's twice as much as you thought.

SPEAKER_00: Even bigger than Zeppelin in Thailand last year? Because I remember looking, you know, getting my step tracker and, like, seeing, oh, man. I I did 15,000 steps in the conference center. Know?

SPEAKER_02: But, yeah, in terms of the expo area, certainly. You know, like, DEFCON was a large, you know, floor area, but it was lots and lots of different rooms of of of talks. Right. Right. And then little stores, whereas this is just, you know, expo hall of selling. I don't know what most of them were. Thousands and thousands of projects that you've never heard of doing a thing that is pretty indistinguishable from everybody else. So, yeah, talking about the the the turnover care and I mean, I'm sure that that's the case is the vast majority of them are gonna be gone in a year's time and never even know they they happened.

SPEAKER_00: But So do you guys think the boringness comes from institutions themselves or what they're doing? Because everyone seems to be doing, like, stable coin or treasury company. You know? Like that. Those seem to be the two options.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I think it's a strange thing in which, like, the meme meme coins ended to some degree with the US elections and, like, I feel like Libra was really the end, you know, in which, you know, the a coin associated with a public official did pretty badly for the the people involved.
