**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] So, hello.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:02] Hello, Bob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:04] So yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:08] And I have here Jakob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] Good enough?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:11] Good enough, yes.
[00:13] There you go.
[00:15] So yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now, I think.
[00:19] We did meet in Bogotá at Devcon 6 for the first time where you introduced yourself.
[00:24] I was not aware of your background and role, but yeah, specifically, you were an intern at FDEV in Berlin in late 2015 and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:34] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:37] Oh yeah, thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:40] It was in Bogotá.
[00:41] I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
[00:44] But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz, maybe, and talking about the old days.
[00:49] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.
[00:56] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client starting around August or September 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:01] I think it was maybe August to December.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:03] Yeah, it was August to December.
[01:05] It was a couple of weeks after Mainnet launched.
[01:07] And the first week I was there was when there was the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:12] There was a chain split on Mainnet.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:14] Yes.
[01:15] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there, and that was the same day there was a meetup planned in the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:20] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:21] So everything was extremely chaotic.
[01:23] People arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:27] Eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working and thought, no, we can't do this—there are so many people just waiting around.
[01:33] Some started leaving, so I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:41] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:42] Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum Meetup group.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:46] Oh goodness. So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:49] I know exactly when it started. It started on the 14th of July, 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:53] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:54] The reason I got into Ethereum—I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:57] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:58] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:02] So this was an internship while you were still doing your undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:05] No, it was actually an internship I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:11] So you had graduated.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:12] Yeah, but just with a bachelor.
[02:14] The Ethereum ecosystem was so small back then.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:16] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:17] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:21] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:24] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:25] To the C++ client or something like that.
[02:27] So yeah, I actually—I think I’ve known of Ethereum since the end of 2014.
[02:32] Anyway, my friends and I wrote this bachelor thesis and shared it with the Foundation.
[02:36] Then we got offered internships.
[02:38] I was the only one who went through with it.
[02:40] I was already tired of studying after just the bachelor, while the other two guys wanted to continue.
[02:44] So I thought, okay, I’m going to do this.
[02:46] A couple of weeks later I moved to Berlin to do my internship, working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:50] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:51] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[02:53] Thinking back now, I’m sad I didn’t write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate it more, but I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[03:01] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:03] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ client development under Gavin that was happening in that office, right?
[03:08] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the guest—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:10] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:11] And then some different people and then—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:12] Some Python, Simon de la Rouviere, I think he was doing Go stuff.
[03:15] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:17] I think they were under the C++ client back then.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:19] But they were.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:20] And Remix as well—well, Mix at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:22] Yeah, yeah.
[03:24] And I also remember Mist—I guess at least Fabian Vogelsteller was around.
[03:28] So there was a good amount of different—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:29] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:30] People around.
[03:31] Quite often people would come and visit from other places.
[03:33] I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:36] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:37] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that, and there was no one else at the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:41] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:42] I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote in the late afternoon on the Skype channel asking if someone would be around because he was a little bit delayed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:47] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:48] So I was just like, oh, it's fine.
[03:50] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[03:52] I had like the smallest room—just a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:56] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:57] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office.
[03:59] I would usually just stay in the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:01] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:02] And then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:04] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:05] So yeah.
[04:06] I had one night where I let him into the office at midnight, and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:10] I got to know him, and he told me about all the testing he was doing. It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:14] And that was cross-client testing as well, wasn’t it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:16] Right, yeah.
[04:17] If I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:21] That was from the C++ client.
[04:23] I know that C++ Ethereum was leading, and the tests were generated from that, but they were also run against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:30] Yeah, that sounds about right.
[04:31] But there were a lot of small stories he told me.
[04:34] We don’t have too much time, so I’ll try to keep it short.
[04:37] But I would say, thinking back, one of the most interesting things that happened was being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:42] Right, yeah.
