SPEAKER_04:**
[0.0s] All righty.
[1.2s] Well, thanks everyone for coming back.
[3.2s] We've done a couple of videos.
[5.6s] So we've done two on the early days of Ethereum.
[10.0s] And I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel.
[15.9s] And
[16.7s] in the process, we’re excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwill.
[21.2s] So Bob will be asked to introduce himself in a second, but he actually went quite in depth in reaction to the videos and helped to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out and we'll link in the notes.
[42.4s] We asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up.
[47.9s] So with that, maybe I’ll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[57.1s] So, yeah, hi, you know, thanks so much for the invite.
[60.4s] You know, like I said to you guys, I loved those first two videos.
[65.1s] I love this history, and it was great to
[70.8s] both hear that and have a slightly different perspective as well. You know, our paths have overlapped in some ways and haven’t in others.
[78.5s] So there were a few things that came up which I wasn’t myself aware of.

[85.1s] I mean, just for everyone's background about me and who I am:**
[92.0s] So I
[94.2s] got interested in blockchain in 2014.
[97.8s] But it was 2015 when I really kind of jumped in.
[101.3s] And that happened because I was working in Toronto. I had a six-month contract, was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum was doing a mainnet launch.
[114.4s] And I’d actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014.
[116.9s] But, you know, I was just kind of following along a little bit—not actually doing anything.
[121.5s] But then moving to Toronto, there was just like orders of magnitude more stuff going on—meetups and Anthony Di Iorio’s Bitcoin Decentral co-working space and everything.
[134.8s] So I got really very addicted
[137.4s] through that year.
[138.5s] And it was like—right—I can’t not get involved.
[141.5s] Right?
[141.8s] It's like you’re there at the birth of the web or whatever,
[145.0s] and you’ve met Tim Berners-Lee, and he’s about to go live on the web.
[149.3s] And it’s like—how can you not want to get involved?
[152.9s] So I just started volunteering and helping. My background prior to that was in the games industry.

[161.6s] So like 15 years of C++.
[164.8s] 15 years in C++.
[166.7s] So I was like, well, I can do something with cpp-ethereum.
[173.1s] I was really into mobile and wearables.
[175.2s] So my first thing I set myself was: can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch?
[180.6s] You know, could you get a smartwatch and go around like—bing—there’s some money? That'd be really cool.
[185.6s] So, yeah, I just started doing stuff on there.
[190.4s] That was about the time that Gav was parting company with the Foundation as well.
[197.7s] So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team.
[203.4s] So during that period, I ended up being—I think—the only person in the world who was actually helping on that.
[211.6s] Like, no companies, nobody was helping.
[215.9s] And then I ended up getting hired into the Foundation in early 2016.
[220.3s] And yeah, I’ve been involved in Enterprise Ethereum, Ethereum Hyperledger, and more recently, Ethereum Classic—nearly a decade now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[236.8s] Yeah, Bob, well, and to be open to everyone, we’re old friends and we're happy to have you as our first guest host on this thing.
[248.3s] But also, you are like the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum ecosystem.
[254.2s] You're friends with everyone.
[255.5s] You've been everywhere.
[259.7s] So it's great to have your perspective on things.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[262.9s] Thank you.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[264.7s] So, and as Kieran has mentioned—for anyone who hasn’t seen Bob’s blog post—it’s notionally a blog post, almost a full novel—probably a novella in size.
[277.5s] It has pictures of a lot of the people we’re talking about.
[280.1s] You dug up so much content out of there.
[283.5s] Were those your personal pictures?
[285.4s] It’s just stuff?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[286.3s] Yeah, yeah, just stuff I had.
[289.9s] I mean, another thing here is,

[293.0s] there’s a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well—one called "Ethereum Foundation People" and one called "Ethereum Foundation Timeline."
[307.7s] So I made those in late 2017, early 2018, because there was no canonical history of any of this.
[317.1s] Like, how did Ethereum start?
[318.9s] I mean, it’s in people’s heads—it’s all second-hand stories that you hear from people that were around—but what’s true? What isn’t?

[327.9s] Because I think, especially on that Foundation side, it was such a mess, right?
[333.8s] Just like all different people not getting on, blowing up—kind of like Parity versus the Foundation, and Charles, you know... just—God.
[348.3s] I think some people had almost taken this position of like, we don’t talk about that, right?
[355.3s] Because anything I say is going to offend somebody else.
[358.7s] So just—la la la—it doesn’t matter.

[363.2s] But yeah, so I started gathering that list of: well, who were the people that were around in the pre-Foundation days and that?
[373.9s] So yeah, I’ve got this one page—this people page—which I think is really cool.
[378.8s] That’s basically from 2013 through to early 2018, identifying anyone that I could who was involved with Ethereum pre-Foundation or who worked for the Foundation in those early years.

[396.2s] And one of the things that’s really great there is Devcon Zero.
[403.6s] So that was the very first Devcon, but it was a closed event.
[408.8s] That wasn’t a public event.
[410.8s] And it was Foundation people at that time, but there were also some other key community sorts of people there as well.
[421.3s] And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions.
[425.5s] So there’s this video that’s about 15 or 20 minutes long of everybody, like:**
[431.1s] “Hi, I’m glad to be here doing, you know, proof-of-stake research,”
[436.2s] just seeing these so young—so many people that were really early twenties, turning up, and it’s like—that’s so-and-so.
[447.5s] And some of these people as well, you know, they’re not involved anymore.
[450.8s] They’re sort of like footnotes in history. But you have that record.

[457.9s] So yeah, that list of people—I got all of that together.
[462.5s] And the reason that that came about was: in late 2017 I got a message from Laura Shin saying, “Hey, I hear Ming's being sacked at the Foundation.
[475.6s] Do you know anything about this?”
[477.3s] And I said, “Well, no, I don’t.
[479.8s] But it wouldn’t surprise me.”

[483.3s] But, you know, basically it would be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you, but nobody else could tell you.
[491.0s] Anyway, and it sort of came out—well yeah, she’s not being sacked, but she’s agreed to leave.
[497.2s] And then it's like, what’s next?

[500.1s] So I contacted Vitalik and said, “Hey, is there anything I can do to help?
[503.6s] What can I do?”
[505.6s] And he said, “Well, the one thing you can do is can you try and talk to people and work out: What would good look like? What do people think a good Ethereum Foundation would look like?”
[527.7s] And that just turned into really a thought experiment on my side of, OK—so to my mind, Ming was terrible.
[538.1s] So how did she get hired?
[540.5s] What was going on two and a half years back that that looked like a good option?
[547.6s] How did it work before?
[550.0s] How did the Foundation come about?
[554.0s] What were the group of leaders, and what were all the dynamics between all of these people?
[558.4s] So yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there.
[561.9s] And that was the genesis for that information gathering.

[566.9s] And I learned a lot.
[570.8s] And that information as well I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books.
[578.8s] It’s kind of like—right—there is no canonical, but this is kind of what I found, which is maybe the best information that there was at that time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[588.8s] Well, and also to your point, I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about—you know—like everything worked smoothly. But innovation is messy.
[600.2s] You know, it’s messy, and there are a million and one different paths that things could have gone. And we just want to kind of acknowledge all that,
[609.9s] given where the ecosystem is today.
[612.8s] And even though, you know, it’s amazing to me that so many people know about it—
[616.1s] we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain, and no one—you know—everyone just glazed over, right?
[626.0s] So it’s just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point.
[630.9s] Oh—
[631.8s] Went a little bit far.
[634.7s] We’ll just go with it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[636.7s] One of the things that I know that Vitalik said—and again, it was maybe in Laura Shin’s book—was that the founding of Ethereum was very atypical.
[651.8s] Because it was essentially, here’s a whitepaper out to a bunch of random people who may be interested.
[661.6s] And it’s basically like, the first people that turn up—right—you’re the founders.
[666.8s] A number of them had not even met each other before. Not really a lot of knowledge.
[675.6s] And so yeah, there were lots of interpersonal things that just didn’t work at all.
[683.6s] It’s just like—no.

[686.0s] Like founding a company—and I’m sure you guys have this experience yourself, right?—
[692.1s] You want to start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit, because you know that you're going through the fire together.
[698.0s] So you better have some stickability with you and common alignment. Or at least
[709.3s] knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times, right? And knowing that you can work it out.
[716.9s] And what seemed to happen on Ethereum was absolutely the polar opposite of that.
[720.6s] Just a random bunch of people who were there—didn’t really know each other.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[725.6s] Make that commitment before you even know what you're doing, right? Yeah. And so that didn’t work so great. I think also—let me actually, I wanted to ask about that. I’m also just looking at the list of the Ethereum Foundation people, which is remarkably long for the type of initiative it was.
[746.0s] You know, we talk about this because we’re a management team and we’re trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such.
[754.1s] Do you think there is any benefit to this level of—you could call it disorganization or just, you know...
[762.4s] I kind of think, if there were a benefit and it wasn’t merely just an inefficient and painful process that Ethereum succeeded in spite of, it’s kind of—it embodied the ethos and it let people—like Vitalik put the idea out there and then people fought for its destiny.
[781.0s] Like, Ethereum existed and then they wanted to be part of taking it to—and he saw the clients and all that too.
[787.8s] Sorry, Jim, go ahead.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[788.8s] I was going to say, it kind of worked like a blockchain works, in fact.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[791.6s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[792.2s] Lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to organize things—and then they fight it out.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[798.3s] But what’s that law—that organizational structure reflects the systems it builds?
[803.5s] Conway’s Law, I think?
[805.1s] Yeah, something like that.
[806.3s] Like—yeah, sorry.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[809.7s] Yeah, I mean, I guess in general, yes—having that frothing, emergent
[817.3s] stuff is good. I think where it was really screwed though was to do with money and the ICO funding—right? That it’s basically like, “OK, here we’re doing the thing, and here is the money.” It’s all actually in this organizational group, and the people in that group are funded—are in this privileged position.

[842.7s] It’s something which
[844.0s] Brian Behlendorf said to me in later years—it’s sort of like the original sin of Ethereum. If you want to have that kind of collaboration—whether it’s the EEA and Hyperledger, or even just the rather looser protocol development around Ethereum—you don’t want to pay one team and not the others, because that just screws the battlefield.
[870.7s] So,
[872.3s] you had this situation, for example, where you’ve got the C++ client, and you’ve got Geth—you did have a Python client as well.
[882.9s] So you had that good triangulation, but essentially the funded ones were C++ and Go.
[888.9s] And then they had the money crisis of like, oh my God, is this thing even going to happen?
[894.9s] Right—we’ve got to cut scope. C++ is gone. Gav ends up going out of the way.
[899.6s] And then you have Parity
[902.6s] having one of the major clients, but without funding.
[907.4s] So it’s like, Geth—that’s the, you know, that’s the favorite child, right?
[911.6s] It’s not the official client, but it is the official client.

[918.5s] So all that sort of separation of implementation versus specification,
[924.5s] and that free market around that was really skewed because the money was with Geth.
[932.0s] Geth were in the Foundation and they’ve got, you know, Vitalik’s kind of blessing and everything.
[936.7s] So I think that's where things were great—because you did have the diversity—but it wasn’t fair diversity.

[947.1s] And I think if you look at what’s happening now on
[950.5s] the consensus clients for—I was going to say Ethereum 2, it’s not called Ethereum 2 anymore—but, you know, the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients, none of those consensus clients are made by the Foundation.
[966.7s] The Foundation doesn’t have client teams.
[969.6s] They do funding—like, they’ve got the grants.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[971.8s] And I think all of those teams are going to be grant recipients.
[975.2s] So that's kind of centralization in a way,
[978.4s] but it is an even playing field in terms of the development, right?
[981.3s] Because you've got an evenness of funding.
[983.6s] And that wasn't the case, you know, originally for Ethereum.
[989.6s] And I think that made a lot of bitterness as well.
[992.3s] Because it's like, well, why do you guys get the money?
[994.3s] Like, we're making another one as well.
[996.2s] Or, you know, other parts of the ecosystem—like, there wasn't a grants program for a number of years.
[1004.3s] Between about 2015 and 2018, there wasn't even a grants program.
[1008.1s] You know, you've got the Foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars, and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything.
[1014.6s] So, yeah, I think the diversity is good, but the money was bad.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1023.2s] Interesting.
[1024.0s] Yeah.
[1024.5s] I think, right.
[1026.3s] Okay.
[1026.5s] That's a good strong point.
[1028.0s] So if you compare it to like a Bitcoin, which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin, but it was kind of similar.
[1035.7s] There was less of a—
[1038.1s] There was no premine and no token presale.
[1043.8s] And so the people who were in it were in it for general interest, and it was really sincerely an even playing field.
[1053.3s] And I would argue, you know—
[1056.5s] In some ways, Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin, especially since, you know, let's say 2015. Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes—
[1066.2s] and that's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way.
[1071.7s] But it’s, I think, you know, been stifled a little bit for that reason.
[1077.3s] I think it's pretty hard probably to make step-function positive changes in a fully decentralized manner.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1086.0s] Another major difference there—talking about clients—is it was a very deliberate decision, right, on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients.
[1097.3s] And that there were multiple clients from day one.
[1100.7s] I'll see if I can find my Twitter thread—I was finding these the other day—I was finding the first commits for PyEthereum, PyEVM, or PiEthereum as it was, C++ Ethereum and Go Ethereum.
[1115.5s] And they were all—I think they were all November or December.
[1121.2s] I think they were all 2013, not even 2014, for those three.
[1125.7s] And then EthereumJ looked like it started in about April, I think.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1131.2s] But you know—yeah, Jim, Kieran, you guys started EthereumH in 2014, right?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[1136.6s] Yeah, we were much later.
[1137.9s] We were—when did we get going?
[1141.9s] In the fourth quarter, 2014.
[1143.8s] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1147.2s] And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer.
[1149.7s] So starting kind of maybe June 2014, I got to know the project pretty well.
[1156.7s] And then I had gone back to Berkeley.
[1159.6s] I was in New York for the summer and met Jim September, October, something like that.
[1165.9s] And we started work more or less right away—more Jim than me.
[1169.5s] But, yeah, so there was a big time delay on our side.

[1173.2s] And yeah, I think—OK yeah, Bob, it's an interesting point, right?
[1176.9s] I think probably they could have—
[1182.4s] there was some real mismanagement at different times, both with the running out of funds, not doing any hedging.
[1188.5s] And then later, I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open-feeling, and that would have alienated fewer people.
[1197.5s] And it could have even just been bigger than it is today.
[1200.3s] Obviously, we're talking about a smashing success here, but it sort of—
[1204.9s] the idea in the community was so powerful that it definitely succeeded in spite of certain things.
[1213.7s] I think there was value still in this, like, throw it out there, get people to fight over it.
[1220.2s] But it probably overcorrected.
[1222.8s] And lots of these people also just went and started their own thing because it wasn't a big enough tent.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1228.6s] I mean, the other thing is right at the start there, it's like—the people that were doing it, that was the whole world, right?
[1233.8s] That was everything, right?
[1235.9s] For several months.
[1238.0s] I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the Foundation even existed.
[1242.2s] That was actually unfunded.
[1244.2s] Yeah.
[1246.2s] Because I'm looking at the dates.
[1247.8s] So the white paper came out in November 2013.
[1254.7s] PyEthereum was started on November the 19th, 2013.
[1259.6s] Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day.
[1264.2s] C++ Ethereum started four days later, 23rd of December—obviously some over-Christmas hacking on these things going on.
[1274.9s] And then Go Ethereum was December the 26th.
[1278.7s] So just three further days.
[1283.0s] The Foundation got formed, I think in May—
[1288.6s] April or May 2014, but the crowdsale didn't conclude until September 2014.
[1295.7s] So you'd actually got about nine months’ worth of development on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded.
[1303.5s] So, you know, I think that unfairness kind of came in a little bit later.
[1309.3s] I think for that phase, it was like nobody got funded.
[1313.1s] Oh, sorry.
[1315.1s] Um, you know, nobody got funded though—
[1317.3s] There was the retrospective payback, right?
[1320.1s] You know, when the crowdsale had gone through, you had, you know, money for early contributors, which I think—it was nearly 10%.
[1329.0s] Yeah,
[1330.7s] for like 100 or 120 people. Like, some people made out like absolute bandits for those early months.
[1339.4s]
[1340.4s] But then, yeah, following that, there was hiring of actual staff onto those teams.
[1349.2s] And that, I think, is when it became kind of uneven.
[1352.8s] Because you already had EthereumJ for a number of months there, and that never got funded.
[1358.1s] And then you guys starting whenever you were starting.
[1363.9s] So yeah, it kind of became uneven, I think, at that point.
[1368.4s] And probably the worst of it of all was for Parity—you know, when that team spun out, and you basically did have a major, rapidly load-bearing client.
[1381.7s] And it was just, you know, unfunded—especially with Gav, who was, you know,
[1389.3s] had been the CTO and wrote the Yellow Paper, and had the first working client and all of the value he delivered.
[1394.9s] And then it’s like, right, sorry, you're out.
[1397.4s] And you're not getting any money.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1398.7s] Yes.
[1402.7s] So my memory around the C++ client was that there were funds to do a security audit for
[1413.1s] two clients, but one at a time. And it was tight, right?
[1417.7s] And so they did Go Ethereum first, and I think they did actually do the security audit on C++ Ethereum, but I'm not quite sure.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1426.0s] I'm not sure they did, you know.
[1429.3s] Maybe there'd been an intention to do that, but then the money ran out before it happened.
[1436.7s] I mean, my understanding in terms of uptake as well is C++ Ethereum—
[1444.4s] Go Ethereum just like caught up and overtook it really fast.
[1450.6s] So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding—which would have been mid-2015—it's like, hey Gav, you're the CTO, but it's your codebase that's got to cop it.
[1460.3s] And then that's what happened.

(Continued due to length...)

**SPEAKER_04:**
[1976.0s] I just have a comment.
[1980.3s] It's interesting, and maybe I commented on this in one of the other videos.
[1984.3s] One of these rare big software projects that did not very much come from the United States is Canada—
[1991.6s] it's different parts of Europe, you know.
[1993.8s] And one of those confusing things, Bob, to your point about who got paid for the clients from the Foundation, I think like, I remember there being a deal struck with Zug, the, you know, the canton basically around it.
[2008.2s] They were like, there's tax stuff and all that sort of thing.
[2011.6s] But they also sort of intended to hire and operate locally.
[2015.6s] People would either move there or they'd hire—
[2018.2s] ETH Zurich grads or whatever.
[2020.2s] I don't know the details specifically, but I think that didn't quite end up happening that way, and sort of as a surprise.

[2028.8s] And I saw some of this firsthand at the meeting in which, you know, Amir and Charles were, you know, sent on their way.
[2037.6s] The client team set up in their own countries.
[2043.2s] And that was like a bit of a script flip, like Gavin wanted to be in Berlin, because I guess the devs were good and inexpensive, and to be like living there— you know, inexpensive, excuse me.

[2057.9s] Yeah, I think it's just, you know, you would— running my own business, you would never make such a decision in such a flip manner where like overnight, we're like, oh, we're doing a different country, you know.
[2067.7s] But that was kind of a regular occurrence to some extent— major things changing, you know, as part of how the Foundation plus operated that I saw.

[2081.5s] And again, it didn't seem to hurt, you know, quite as much as you might expect.
[2087.3s] But yeah, but I think, you know, you had to have— you were lucky in how excited people were about the project that it survived all of this.

[2098.2s] And again, from our side, you know, we're sitting in the Bay Area at that time, and we're like, why do they keep doing all of these things?
[2103.9s] Like, they're trying to build a thousand things, and it's hard to build one thing.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2108.6s] Yeah, I mean, so there were separate legal entities for those as well, right?
[2113.8s] So you had FDev AG,
[2116.2s] in Berlin, and then there was an Amsterdam thing for the Geth team.
[2123.3s] You had the London stuff as well, which was mainly communications sort of stuff with Stephan and George Hallam, Ian Meikle, and one other person who I forget.

[2141.8s] But, you know, you sort of talk about, you know, these people working for the Ethereum Foundation, but it was always woolier than that.
[2150.0s] So, yeah, you did have the Stiftung in Zug, but most people, even if they were working full-time, they weren't actually working for that.

[2161.5s] You know, so when I had my contract, it was with the for-profit FDev,
[2167.7s] in Berlin, that was who I was actually working for.
[2170.3s] And then they were funded by the Foundation.

[2173.5s] And FDev in general— that was another big split that there was, right?
[2178.3s] Was that you got the Foundation, but then you had FDev that was like the kind of umbrella group for that, that Gav was leading essentially.
[2187.5s] So I think the Amsterdam thing like rolled into Berlin.
[2191.1s] I think that was all sort of FDev side.

[2195.7s] And that in itself was a huge item of conflict.
[2199.6s] I know, again, in Laura's book, I think Joe was talking about that, right? Was that Gav kind of wanted a big chunk of money.
[2209.6s] It's like, right, the funds are there from the crowdsale now, so give them all to us, right?
[2215.9s] And it's like, yeah, I don't know that we want to give you all the funds.

[2221.3s] But that was typical of that period— just a mess of complexity and interpersonal things and organizational complexity.

[2234.4s] And with that Swiss people thing, so my understanding on that was that was like a main motivation for renting that spaceship building, right?
[2246.9s] It was the intention that there were going to be a load of people there, but like maybe it was— I think testing was one of the ones I heard was maybe a goal there.
[2259.6s] It's like, right, we're going to get a load of Swiss people to test things.

[2262.6s] And there was also like Mihai with his Holon ideas— Holon as these co-working space-y things around the world.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2272.6s] And also to make it a little bit more woollier, very shortly ConsenSys emerged out of that too.
[2281.2s] And they were doing a bunch of work.
[2282.5s] We were technically working under ConsenSys for the first little parts of it too.
[2288.7s] And all of that was in the mix everywhere.

[2294.0s] I want to jump ahead a bit because we have you as an ETC expert.
[2299.2s] And in our last one, we had a lot of questions around what we remembered from Slock.it and the DAO hack.
[2307.5s] So maybe you could walk us through that and how ETC emerged out of that.
[2312.3s] That part was a little bit vague to us because we didn't follow much on how those pieces all came together.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2321.4s] Yeah.
[2323.4s] One of the groups or companies that came out of this kind of shrinking of the Foundation was that on the C++ team that got most of the cuts— a good chunk of those people just went straight to Parity and just carried on with that new client.

[2347.0s] But Christoph Jentzsch, who had
[2350.5s] the testing effort— we were just talking about those same tests.
[2353.9s] He and Stephan Tual, who had been community communications lead, and Lefteris, who'd also been on the C++ team— those three went off and formed a company called Slock.it.

[2373.5s] So Slock.it being smart locks— just the idea that you,
[2379.5s] you know, whatever, if you're doing an Airbnb or something, that you could have a smart lock and you could go and do your contract with someone for the rental.
[2389.9s] And then that could be enabling something on the lock that's checking an Oracle or an on-chain thing and so on.

[2399.4s] And that was their product area.

[2405.6s] At Devcon1,
[2408.6s] they did an onstage demo that was— it was like a kettle, like a pot.
[2414.8s] Yeah, I remember that.
[2416.1s] Like doing this transaction that turned it on to make a cup of tea.
[2420.0s] Yeah.
[2420.4s] That was the onstage demo.

[2425.2s] But what seemed to happen there was— like, they didn't want to do an ICO.
[2431.5s] They wanted it to be fairer, I guess. Because around that era,
[2438.1s] and more later, you saw lots of cash-grab ICOs. And it’s like, right, here's all the money up front—
[2444.7s] you know, we're not going to deliver. What are you going to do, right?

[2447.7s] So they didn't want to do that, because they were very genuine people who came out of the Foundation and were kind of ideologically driven.

[2457.5s] So Vitalik had written stuff about DAOs, right? I think they were mentioned in the whitepaper even.
[2468.8s] And it's like, well, maybe we can make a DAO.

[2472.3s] And I think that was just Slock.it DAO originally,
[2477.4s] and it was like, right, we're going to have a DAO.
[2480.4s] The money is going to go into there, but then it's only going to get released to us as we deliver milestones.

[2487.9s] So it's kind of like this separation— the DAO is where the money is, and that's controlled by the token holders.
[2495.4s] Slock.it as a company is a service provider into that, but we're a sackable service provider, and we're only going to get paid as we go through the milestones.

[2505.9s] So it's like, oh, that's really interesting.

[2509.1s] And to my understanding, that's what was presented at Devcon1, from what I remember. It was like, hey, with Slock.it, this is what we're doing, and we're going to do a DAO with it.
[2519.5s] And it's like, oh, cool.

[2521.7s] But then they kept working on that DAO
[2525.7s] stuff after Devcon1, and it just seemed to morph into, “we’ve made a DAO framework.”
[2533.0s] It's a DAO library, you know, because we want other people to be able to do this as well.
[2538.5s] But then that sort of turned into, well, actually— how about it isn't just us?
[2543.5s] How about it could be anything? Like anyone could have a service provider, you could propose anything into it.
[2549.9s] And then it became The DAO.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2552.4s] Okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2553.3s]
[2554.3s] And it wasn't capped.
[2557.2s] There was no cap on the contributions into it.
[2561.0s] There was really nothing else that you could do on Ethereum at that point.
[2565.2s] It was kind of like the first application, really.
[2568.7s] Well, I mean, you did have a few.
[2570.8s] You had Digix, this gold thing.
[2573.8s] You did have DAI, I think, was sort of coming to life just about at that point.
[2580.7s] But The DAO was kind of like the first big thing.
[2584.5s] And it just sort of snowballed and snowballed, right?
[2586.7s] Because it was also touted as zero risk because you could exit with your funds, right?
[2594.7s] If you didn't like the result of what was happening, you could just exit and have your ETH back.
[2599.3s] So it's kind of like, this is risk-free, right?
[2601.1s] It's like a sovereign bond or whatever, right?
[2604.4s] There’s no downside here.
[2605.6s] This is risk-free.
[2607.7s] So tons of people were like, well, what else am I gonna do?
[2610.6s] I'm just sitting here on my ether.
[2611.7s] I can't do anything.
[2612.7s] Well, you know, pile on in.

[2614.9s] And the Ethereum crowdsale raised, what—$16 million, I think, in bitcoin, which I think was number five crowdsale of all time, you know, it was like comparing to Kickstarter projects.
[2630.4s] Right.
[2630.6s] So it's like, you know, maybe The DAO will do, you know, $2 or $3 million, maybe $5.
[2636.6s] And it just went until it was absolutely gigantic.

[2645.3s] And I remember at the time thinking, you know, this is— I don't like this. The DAO, it's not— this is not a good idea.

[2654.2s] And the main reason I was thinking of that was: is this a security?
[2662.2s] Is this seen as, you know, money transfer stuff?
[2668.9s] Because you’ve got Slock.it the company, then they have this thing called DAO.Link,
[2673.8s] that was sort of a service company for paying people in real life.
[2679.6s] That was some Swiss thing, I think— or Bitcoin Suisse.
[2685.3s] And then you had The DAO itself.
[2688.0s] You had the curators as well.
[2690.7s] So anyone could propose a smart contract that encoded their proposal, right?
[2697.0s] They would make a written description of the thing, and here's a smart contract doing it.
[2702.8s] And the curators' role was to verify, is what they've said in text what they've coded?

[2712.4s] It was meant to be this administrative role.
[2717.7s] But what happened is all of those guys— that was their names and faces up on the website.
[2723.4s] You know, so like DAO Hub website— it's just like a who's who of the Ethereum Foundation, basically.
[2730.4s] And it didn't say, you know, Christian Reitwiessner, creator of Solidity—
[2736.2s] it said Christian Reitwiessner, Ethereum Foundation; Vitalik, Ethereum Foundation; you know, so lots of people were like, this is an Ethereum Foundation project, right?
[2746.0s] Because you've all got your names on everything.

[2749.0s] So I thought there was, firstly, huge legal liability on those guys.
[2753.9s] Because where Slock.it got these layers of legal protection— these guys haven’t. They're just doing it as individuals.
[2759.8s] And I remember Fabian
[2763.7s] talking to me and talking to the group and the Foundation. It's like, you know, I've been talking to some of my friends, and they're like, you know, they don't think this is a great idea.
[2772.5s] And I'm thinking of talking to a lawyer. And Gav backed out, right?
[2778.6s] A couple of weeks before all the disaster, Gav just backed out.
[2783.9s] He's like, you know, this is— this is not what I signed up for.

[2788.5s] I thought it was just a small role.
[2790.3s] And now it's presented as a lot more, and, you know— so he backed out.
[2798.3s] A lot of the others didn’t, because it was like, well, if we back out, it’s going to ruin it.
[2803.4s] And it's like a great experiment.
[2806.6s] But I thought there was huge liability to them.
[2808.4s] I thought there were legal risks.
[2810.7s] And I also just thought it was a stupid idea.
[2813.6s] Like, why would you have thousands of random people putting their money in a bucket and then let’s vote on what to do with it?
[2821.0s] Who are these people?
[2822.0s] What do they even know about a business proposal or anything?
[2827.2s] It's just like, this is a stupid idea.
[2829.4s] But I didn't have my eye on the fact that all of the tech stack was incredibly immature at that point, right?
[2837.7s] There's no best practices.
[2838.9s] There's no libraries.
[2840.5s] It’s just, here’s some code.
[2842.7s] And they just went all in, right?
[2844.8s] It was like, code is law.
[2847.3s] The smart contract is the contract.
[2850.2s] YOLO. You can't stop us.

UNKNOWN:**
[2854.5s] Kaboom.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2856.2s] But OK. And then the hack happens, right?
[2859.6s] And I remember the details of the hack being— they found a flaw in the smart contract code, and they could basically withdraw those funds into another account.
[2871.0s] And I remember there was some kind of race between, like, the people at The DAO/Slock.it who were using the same exploit to drain the account— like using the same hack basically. Is that right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2887.3s] Yeah, so there was this reentrancy bug, where— it’s really sort of to do with
[2896.2s] atomic operations or order of operations.
[2899.7s] So your reentrancy was that you could be calling— because people were supplying their proposals, and it’s like, hey, here’s a smart contract that’s implementing mine—
[2910.1s] you were like calling into their code, but you can't know what theirs is going to do.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2913.9s] So there was this reentrancy issue where, within that other person's supplied code, you could kind of call back in.
[2922.1s] And it was sort of like—
[2924.1s] So it was to do with child DAOs.
[2926.6s] So this whole zero-risk thing was like, if you didn't like proposals that were happening, you could make a child DAO saying, "Well, hey, I'm out," right?
[2937.0s] "I'm taking my ether and my voting off into this other one," right?
[2941.5s] "I'm not following you."
[2942.7s] "I'm going there."
[2944.2s] And other people could join you as well.
[2946.3s] So I guess the idea was like, right, you know, here we've got this totally over-general DAO, but we're going to make a—
[2952.8s] you know, like a DeFi DAO or an NFT DAO or whatever, right?
[2957.3s] And it's, I guess, a little bit like some of the thoughts around ConsenSys and hub-and-spoke—like, you're going to get this universe of stuff just flourishing out in child DAOs and so on.
[2971.6s] But yeah, the problem with that child DAO thing is that there was this reentrancy bug where, rather than just being able to pull your ETH or your share,
[2981.8s] you could actually go in and pull more and more.
[2983.9s] So you had this—using this kind of child DAO—and pulling a giant amount of the funds into that child DAO.
[2994.2s] And then within 30 days, they’d be able to exit with the funds.
[2998.8s] But kind of the blessing, I guess, of that setup was they weren't immediately exiting with the funds, right?
[3007.0s] They hadn't gone already and sold it on an exchange and were done before you noticed. You had this—
[3011.9s] period.
[3013.8s] And then the other thing is that you could join them.
[3016.5s] You could go into the child DAO as well.
[3018.9s] So after the hack, there was this appeal out: "Hey, did anyone participate in this specific child DAO?"
[3027.5s] "Is anyone in there?"
[3028.3s] And it's like, yeah, somebody else is in there.
[3031.3s] And then what you could do is you could child DAO again.
[3034.9s] You could do another one.
[3037.1s] Like, "Well, I'm going to grab it off you," and "You're going to grab it off me."
[3042.1s] So, you know, you could have had this DAO Wars thing of like—you can never stop it, but you could delay it indefinitely.

[3050.0s] So that was one of them.
[3051.6s] But then the other white hat thing is like, "Okay, well, we know about the bug, so we can do it too."
[3057.8s] You could have white hat people like, "Well, we’re going to steal all of the money out of the top DAO as well—but we’re doing it for good, right?"
[3065.2s] "We're doing it here to keep it, to give it back."
[3069.4s] So yeah, you had all of those games going on within that existing setup.

[3075.2s] But then, as a reaction to that, you had all of this discussion about, "Well, are we going to react? Are we not going to react?"
[3080.4s] The first proposal was a soft fork.
[3087.3s] But it was just going to blacklist out stuff to do with the hacker, right?

VITALIK BUTERIN (presumed — context unclear):**
[3094.7s] And they did do that soft fork, right?
[3096.8s] I remember they did that soft fork first.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3099.3s] It was done for it.
[3100.4s] And I think it might even have gone on testnets and things, but it never went live.
[3104.9s] Okay.
[3105.9s] Because it was spotted that it was a denial-of-service attack.
[3110.3s] Because that blacklisting was like, you know, not accounted for in the crypto-economics.
[3117.3s] So it was like, yeah, yeah, you had a denial-of-service attack thing on that soft fork.
[3125.3s] So it got done and then it got undone.
[3127.7s] And then the hard fork was like, okay, well, we can go in and we can do an irregular state transition—
[3135.4s] where, at a certain block, you're just going to have a hardcoded thing which sticks different bytecode into the address of the DAO—
[3154.0s] which is like, "Okay, yeah, that thing? It didn't happen."
[3160.1s] You know, what's actually at that address is a simple refund thing where you can all get your money back.
[3166.7s] So that was the DAO hard fork.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[3172.7s] I just wanted to ask, where were you at this time?
[3175.0s] Because I know you got involved, I believe, later with ETC, because it didn't exist yet.
[3180.4s] And so, in terms of your personal perspective on all this, were you actually implementing anything yourself?
[3190.7s] Because obviously, you've got pretty deep knowledge of the technical internals.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3196.5s] Yes, I was working for the Foundation.
[3199.9s] I was on the C++ team at that point.
[3201.8s] You know, this is about three or four months after I'd started.
[3208.4s] The thing that was really interesting to me was how different people's thoughts or perspectives were, even within the Foundation.
[3220.2s] You know, you'd have people, say, working on Geth,
[3225.8s] going, "Well, of course we shouldn't do anything."
[3228.9s] "Well, of course we should."
[3230.5s] And it's like, you know, been working with you for a year.
[3233.3s] Like, what?
[3234.2s] "You think that?"
[3235.0s] Like, woo!
[3236.3s] You know, you had this real mixture of reactions.

[3241.5s] And I mean, my first reaction was, well, you know, of course you don't do anything.
[3247.5s] Like, it's an immutable blockchain.
[3249.7s] That's the whole point.
[3250.7s] Like, you don't like the outcome?
[3253.2s] Well, you know, tough titties.
[3255.8s] You saw—you've seen so many, you know, like Mt.
[3259.6s] Gox.
[3260.7s] Mt. Gox—you didn't have the Bitcoiners going, "Oh, you know, let's try and fix this up," or—
[3266.2s] I think the only reason it happened was because of the scale of it.
[3273.1s] It was a significant chunk of the entire monetary base.

[3281.8s] And also, I think that, you know, things weren’t super great on funding.
[3289.1s] And, you know, it wasn’t like Ethereum was sure to succeed.
[3294.1s] It was quite, you know, nascent at that point.

[3298.0s] And I know that there were also worries about—
[3300.9s] the proof-of-stake transition and the fact that if you had a large amount of the ether in hostile hands, then you could maybe have years of griefing attacks and stuff like that.

[3318.8s] But also, I think there was just—
[3320.4s] a lot of people were like, "Well, this is theft," right?
[3326.4s] "That money was intended for building the ecosystem, and some guy's come in and stolen it.
[3331.5s] And if we can fix that, well, we should."

[3336.9s] So yeah, I mean, my immediate reaction was you shouldn't.
[3342.5s] But I also—it was like, well, you know, whatever, that seems to be the consensus, that we do it, you know?
[3349.8s] And okay, off we go.

[3354.4s] Though I wasn't at the Foundation many more months after that anyway.

[3363.4s] But there was this real schism.
[3365.8s] Though I think, from what I saw, probably about 85% of people wanted to do the hard fork and 15% didn't—or maybe 80/20.
[3378.3s] But I think there was pretty strong consensus to do it.
[3384.9s] But that was very contentious for a not-tiny group of people.

[3387.9s] You know, a lot of people who got involved with Ethereum had done so because they kind of wanted Bitcoin with smart contracts.
[3397.9s] And if you're of that Bitcoin-y mindset, then yeah—
[3399.5s] of course you don't screw with things.

[3405.1s] But I think there's also this larger group that were like, "Well, ether isn't money anyway."
[3411.9s] That was a messaging that had been given out at the time.
[3414.4s] Like, "No, no, it's fuel," right?
[3415.8s] It's fuel for the engine.
[3418.2s] Though I think part of that was just to dodge legal liability.
[3422.5s] But that was also true as well—
[3425.4s] this whole world computer—
[3427.7s] here's a platform, right?
[3429.3s] It's a platform like the web, or Android.
[3432.2s] So I think that was the mental split:**

[3435.1s] Is it money?
[3436.4s] And if it's money, you don't move people's money without private keys—that's a mortal sin.

[3442.3s] And on the other side, you're like, "Well, no—it's a bug," right?
[3446.6s] It's a bug in the platform.
[3448.3s] "Well, but it's—"
[3450.8s] But it was a bug in the smart contract.
[3452.5s] Well, if you've worked on serious software projects,
[3455.1s] people hack shit on the wrong layers all the time because it’s going to give you a better user experience.
[3460.9s] Like, you don’t have to be pure on that.
[3465.0s] It’s really about how the thing works.
[3466.7s] So you get hacks in the wrong layers all the time.
[3470.1s] And if you're just seeing it as a software platform, then yeah—it’s a bug.
[3476.1s] You fix the bug.

Continue to part 2...

[3849.9s] Well, firstly, the DAO hack didn't happen.
[3852.3s] That was the only initial difference.
[3854.8s] Very rapidly, though, there was this conclusion that fixed economic policy was needed.
[3861.2s] You know, the ETC was really like Bitcoin with Ethereum technology, but, you know, Bitcoin culture and ethos.
[3869.8s] So it's like, right, you know, there's no fixed monetary policy for Ethereum.
[3874.8s] I mean, you see this over many years—changes to
[3878.8s] block rewards, Ice Age delays, fee burning—many, many changes.

[3886.6s] So the first kind of major change on the ETC side was the introduction of that fixed monetary policy, because there was consensus that that was important.
[3897.3s] That was like bad inheritance that we wanted to fix.
[3901.2s] And the other thing that that enabled was the Grayscale ETC Fund.
[3906.8s] So at that point, it's like, right, okay, this is really a Bitcoin-feeling thing.
[3911.3s] And, you know, there's a feeling that there's value here.

[3916.3s] So then from that, Grayscale created the ETC Cooperative that I work from—
[3923.5s] you know, a share of the fees went into that. Kind of not quite a foundation, but a bit like a foundation—a nonprofit to support the ecosystem.

[3936.0s] And then the other thing more recently is just proof of work.
[3940.2s] There was fairly rapidly a consensus that ETC wanted to stick with proof of work indefinitely,
[3946.6s] but that proof of stake was seen as a centralizing, oligarchic
[3957.4s] kind of thing that didn't really fit with that ethos.
[3962.4s] But more generally, ETC is tracking protocol changes in Ethereum—you know, very compatible.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3968.8s] So there have been forks, but not the hard fork along the way, because...
[3973.6s] Well, so yeah, I mean, there are hard forks, but not chain splits.
[3978.9s] Got it.
[3979.4s] Okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3981.3s] In the end, all protocol updates on Ethereum as well—they're all hard forks.
[3986.4s] And the old side doesn't actually go away.
[3988.8s] You could run a Frontier node if you wanted.
[3992.3s] You can mine on Frontier, mine the Olympic Testnet, mine any of these ones.
[3996.3s] It's just that they wither and die because there hasn't been contention.
[4003.4s] But on ETC, you have sufficient contention that you had a chain split.
[4009.6s] But yeah, I guess that's a bit...
[4015.1s] You know, "forks are bad."
[4018.4s] But it's like, contentious hard forks are bad.
[4023.4s] Hard forks are an upgrade mechanism for the protocol.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4027.2s] Yeah, I mean, I remember I had to implement that fork a few years ago, and it was pretty blatant.
[4033.4s] It was just like, take money from here and place it here.
[4036.8s] By the way, it didn't bug me.
[4039.0s] But we had people in BlockApps who thought of it as like a stab in the back.
[4044.4s] They were like so upset by it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4047.1s] Well, I mean, it's literally, here's an array of addresses, right?
[4050.0s] So, f**k with.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4051.2s] Yep.
[4052.3s] I don't remember what else was in there, but I remember the majority of it was just like, take a bunch of money and put it into these addresses.
[4060.2s] That was the fork.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4062.3s] Yeah.
[4063.2s] For this list of addresses, replace the bytecode with this other bytecode.
[4072.6s] Also, I think the movement was consolidating the child DAOs.
[4076.9s] I think that's what that was doing.
[4078.9s] So it's like, move the money from the child DAOs back into the parent DAO and change the bytecode.
[4086.6s] Like, I think—if block equals this, do a horrible thing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4093.1s] But in the ETC world, where the DAO hack happened, are those funds—like, did the hacker pull out those funds?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4107.0s] Yeah, yeah.
[4108.5s] Interesting.
[4109.0s] Yeah.
[4109.2s] I mean, again, Laura Shin has a great write-up of all of this in her book, The Cryptopians, including working out who it probably was.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4120.3s] Oh, wow.
[4120.7s] OK.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4121.9s] So she didn’t name names in the book, but then she did an article
[4130.1s] like on the release day or just before, naming who she thinks it was. So that’s an interesting story—I’ll dig out that article and send it to you guys so you can add it to the description here.

[...Pause in topic...]

[4153.8s] Bob, you're a natural-born bridge builder, as we said. You get along with everyone.
Do you ever see the, you know,
valley between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic narrowing or getting better? Or do you think it is getting better?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4162.1s] I mean, the problem that Ethereum Classic has always had—from the time of the split—and it comes back to money again,
[4184.2s] like I think that was the one thing that the Foundation did wrong. You know, not talking about the developers or the decision or whatever,
[4189.1s] was to only put the money on one side.
[4193.6s] Because what that did is disenfranchised a good chunk of people who had invested in the pre-sale, who'd been part of that community, who'd genuinely been actively involved for those first two years.
[4205.1s] And they were just left in the dust.
[4206.5s] It's like, “F**k you guys.
[4208.1s] We don't care what you think.
[4209.5s] Goodbye.”
[4210.9s] “And the trademark's going this way, and all the funds are going this way.”
[4214.5s] And all the developers went that way as well.
[4218.0s] And I mean, obviously the Foundation couldn't control that—what people chose to work on—
[4223.2s] but what that meant is effectively that group of people got defunded. Totally done.
[4231.8s] "I’m sorry, my child. I disavow you and I’ll kick you out of the house forever and I wish I’ll never talk to you again."
[4239.6s] I think in retrospect, it should have been like, “Okay, funding is available for that other fork as well. And you may hate us and not want to talk to us, but—”
[4249.3s] I guess it’s like a child—whatever—teenager: “F**k you Dad, I'm leaving home."
[4256.7s] And it's like, “Okay, I’m not going to stop putting aside savings and money for you.
[4261.3s] You might not love me now, but you’re my child too,
[4265.8s] and we’ll find a way of making it happen.”
[4269.1s] Same with the ETC Cooperative—you know, it could have been, well, when that came into existence, the Foundation could have gone,
[4280.1s] “Okay, here’s a body that can help—and there you go, we’re going to fund it as well.”
[4285.4s] And there was something a little, tiny bit like that with Virgil.
[4290.4s] Virgil was also a huge bridge builder between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
[4296.7s] So in 2018, he invited Anthony Lusardi, who was my predecessor, to speak at EdCon.
[4303.4s] So this was May 2018.
[4305.6s] And that was the first Ethereum Classic talk at an Ethereum event—in nearly two years at that point.
[4314.9s] And it was fine, and it was cool, and everyone was friendly.
[4320.6s] Vitalik and various others came to that talk—it was all friendly.
[4325.7s] And Anthony invited me to Ethereum Classic Summit in September 2018.
[4335.8s] So myself and Virgil went and spoke at that event.
[4339.7s] And around that time,
[4342.2s] somehow they found some ETC that the Foundation still had.
[4347.6s] Generally, they did a market dump at that time,
[4352.1s] but there was some stuff they found—like 50 grand or something like that.
[4357.4s] And we got that donated to the Co-op, which was great.
[4361.2s] That was a really nice kind of thing.
[4364.3s] But it was kind of like, here’s a little gesture.
[4369.6s] I really think that was a real failing because it was a legitimate, irreconcilable difference,
[4380.0s] but it was made even worse by this “100% ETH purity pledge”
[4384.5s] combined again with “and all the money’s gone.”
[4391.0s] So you end up with a very small community of mostly people who are very ideologically outraged by it.
[4399.1s] If you've got speculative token holders, obviously, they’re going to stick with Ethereum.
[4405.6s] "What’s this other thing, this new thing? There’s nothing..."
[4409.8s] So that’s always been the issue that ETC’s had—lack of money and interest, really.

[4427.2s] More recently, we've had support from Bitmain.
[4431.2s] After the Merge, with Ethereum moving to proof of stake, all of a sudden ETC is one of the larger mining ecosystems.
[4439.6s] So now we're very aligned with Bitmain.
[4443.7s] They want to sell ASICs.
[4444.7s] They want to be using Antpool for mining.
[4448.8s] So they’re supporting a grant program now.
[4451.7s] But yeah, ETC is small,
[4456.8s] but you have some people, and that’s what they want.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4462.4s] Yeah.
[4462.9s] And as you said, like, you know—it’s the broken mode of sidechains surviving, right?
[4468.1s] It’s possible, you know.
[4473.7s] Oh, sorry, go ahead, Kieran.

**SPEAKER_04 (likely Kieran):**
[4475.9s] I wanted to talk quickly about the definition of success for blockchains.
[4482.7s] Market caps, and all that sort of thing.
[4486.6s] And I was looking today—and Ethereum’s market cap is in the $200 billion.
[4493.4s] Ethereum Classic is still at number 28, which is quite impressive, and is a $2.6 billion market cap.
[4501.9s] I think market cap is probably more an indicator of popularity than anything truly long-term.
[4509.6s] It’s not quite like
[4511.6s] with companies, where market cap is probably a better indicator of how important they are.
[4518.2s] But it is also still...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4523.0s] If you look in CoinGecko, Ethereum Classic is higher than Cosmos, Filecoin, Hedera, Internet Computer, Aptos, Lido, Near...
[4539.8s] than Optimism, than Arbitrum, than The Graph.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4545.6s] So I wanted to follow that—Is market cap a good goal?
[4551.0s] What is your goal for ETC?
[4554.6s] If you were trying to make up the gap with Ethereum, would you do anything differently?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4561.1s] I mean, I think to do that, you just need vast investment into the application layer.
[4570.1s] That’s somewhere where ETC really can’t compete with many other VC chains
[4574.4s] that have huge treasuries that can be spending tens or hundreds of millions on grant programs.
[4586.7s] We can’t compete that way.
[4589.1s] But also, as you say, it's a bit of a vanity metric in a way.
[4594.8s] There are many other vanity metrics that we commonly see in the space.
[4602.7s] Because yeah—if you want whatever the fastest chain is, or the most money, or whatever—
[4607.7s] that's not going to be ETC. It can never be ETC.
[4613.7s] But for people that are interested, that's not the goal, right?
[4616.8s] They’re looking for something that's basically like Bitcoin plus smart contracts—
[4622.9s] with that kind of
[4625.7s] strong non-intervention bias, and also proof of work.
[4631.3s] A lot of people see real value in proof of work and are very skeptical of proof of stake systems.
[4640.4s] So, you know—
[4645.4s] It's not winner-takes-all.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4649.1s] It's been interesting just how not a winner-takes-all the blockchain space has been.
[4654.2s] They're like cockroaches.
[4656.4s] They just kind of keep going.
[4660.3s] I know they get delisted occasionally, but how many... let's see how many pages you can get to on—
Can we call them tree clippings instead of... yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4669.4s] 20,000 is the big record.
[4672.8s] Yeah.
[4673.5s] 20,000 live chains.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4676.0s] That's quite a number, and very interesting in and of itself.
[4681.3s] Victor, you were saying something when I made my comment?

**SPEAKER_00 (likely Victor):**
[4683.9s] Oh no, no, no.
[4684.5s] I was just saying, I was going to ask you more questions about the early days of EEA, but I think we will have to invite you back
[4692.6s] because I’m pretty sure we could have another 90-minute conversation on that.
[4704.3s] Great to have you, Bob.
[4706.2s] As always, you've always been a great friend and a wealth of information on the space.
[4711.2s] So thank you for joining us, and we hope you'll come back again soon.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4715.2s] Well, thank you, and sorry for monopolizing.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4719.2s] No, this is exactly why you're here.
[4721.6s] Your story—we've told plenty of ours.
[4725.2s] Should we... You know, I see on other podcasts, should we send people anywhere?
[4731.3s] Where can people find you? Do you want them to find you, etc.?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4735.6s] Yeah, I can.
[4736.4s] Yeah, I can drop you some links afterwards.
[4739.5s] But yeah, my own website is BobsonWorld.com.
[4743.1s] EthereumClassic.org is the main sort of landing page for ETC.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4750.6s] Awesome.
[4750.9s] Fantastic.
[4751.7s] Well, thank you very much.
[4752.7s] Really appreciate your time.
[4754.2s] And I'm sure we will follow up—
[4756.3s] we'll put our heads together and do another one when we're all ready.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4760.8s] Yes, we’ll have to have a round two.
[4762.2s] There’s plenty more stories that we haven’t even touched on yet.

**SPEAKER_04:**
[4767.6s] OK.
[4767.8s] Cheers, guys.
[4769.5s] Cheers.
