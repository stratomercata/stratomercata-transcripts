# RTX 5070 Blackwell Dependency Chain:
#   RTX 5070 Blackwell (sm_120) requires PyTorch nightly
#     - Stable PyTorch 2.5.x and earlier only support up to sm_90 (Hopper/Ada)
#     - sm_120 (Blackwell) support only available in nightly builds
#     - Will be in stable PyTorch 2.6+ when released (expected Q1-Q2 2026)
#   PyTorch nightly requires pyannote-audio 4.0.1+
#
# Conflicts with WhisperX 3.7.4:
#   - Requires torch~=2.8.0 (attempts downgrade to 2.8.x)
#   - Requires pyannote-audio<4.0.0 (incompatible with PyTorch nightly)
#   - Uses use_auth_token (renamed to 'token' in pyannote 4.x)
#
# Resolution (see install_packages_and_venv.sh for details):
#   1. Install PyTorch nightly first
#   2. Install WhisperX (pulls older versions)
#   3. Patch WhisperX code for pyannote 4.x API
#   4. Force-reinstall PyTorch nightly
#   5. Upgrade pyannote-audio to 4.0.1+
