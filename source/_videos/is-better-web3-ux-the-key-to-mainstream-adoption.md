[30.9s] So, today, we have a special guest with us.
[34.7s] It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian,
[38.3s] but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here
[42.3s] as an ex-BlockAppser.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[55.4s] Yes, exactly.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[56.6s] Yeah, yeah.
[58.2s] You guys gave me my...
[58.9s] You gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017,
[62.9s] which it feels like ages ago.
[64.7s] I mean, it is ages ago.

[Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }}):
[65.6s] Lifetime, yeah.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[67.5s] Yeah, so thank you guys for that.
[69.2s] Happy to be on here.
[70.2s] It's always great seeing you guys around.
[71.9s] And so, talking about one of my favorite topics.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[75.7s] Welcome.
[76.3s] So, yeah, so welcome back.
[78.1s] Would you like to introduce yourself
[80.6s] and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[84.3s] Yeah, sure.

Bob
[85.4s] Start there.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[87.4s] So, Brian Smocovich.
[88.9s] bsmokes.eth on Twitter.
[92.2s] We're building PistachioFi.
[94.9s] It's a mobile-first neobank built entirely on crypto rails
[100.7s] meant to provide premium savings with premium security.
[104.9s] And the whole concept of better UX, right?
[109.6s] Like, I will get to the question in a moment of
[112.7s] is UX the key to mainstream adoption?
[115.9s] But I wanted to really just build something that, you know,
[118.8s] I think self-custody is really important to me
[121.6s] and I think really important to a lot of people
[123.5s] about why we originally got into the space.
[126.4s] But the UX for a lot of these apps
[128.7s] was just always so terrible, right?
[130.7s] And so, I just wanted to be at the change
[134.6s] that I wanted to see in the world.
[136.2s] And so, decided to just say, screw it.
[138.1s] I built my own, you know,
[140.6s] basically taught myself UI design
[142.1s] in order to kind of begin this in the beginning.
[146.2s] And then built it literally by willing,
[148.8s] willing Pistachio into existence
[150.5s] and many, many, many, many, many iterations
[154.2s] of building the app.
[156.0s] And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed
[159.3s] that we've been, you know, publicly recognized
[161.3s] by many Ethereum talking heads
[164.4s] in the sense of being recognized for our UX
[167.9s] and what we've been designing and doing and building
[170.3s] and doing things in a way
[172.6s] to just bring more people on-chain.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[176.4s] I see that the number you said
[179.6s] was 18 versions in five months.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[183.6s] Oh, we've pushed out several since that tweet.
[187.5s] Probably at least three or four.
[189.5s] So that, yeah, we ship a lot.
[192.4s] We ship, it's a lot of just talking to users
[195.6s] and finding what's broken, what's wrong.
[198.8s] I'll be at a conference
[200.3s] and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders
[202.2s] as they download the app and like watch
[204.1s] and every little tap, right?
[205.7s] Like, oh, the focus is wrong.
[206.9s] Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard
[208.3s] in this certain one.
[209.6s] In this one certain instance
[210.2s] or the search is showing the wrong things, you know?
[212.4s] And so every little,
[214.1s] that's the kind of the thing about UX
[215.4s] is you design something and then you build it, right?
[220.5s] And then it's, of course, it's gonna be bugged.
[222.6s] Everything is always bugged, right?
[223.8s] And like we go through rigorous testing to do it.
[225.6s] But then when it goes on to somebody's
[228.4s] like very specific use case
[229.9s] because they touch certain things in a certain way
[232.0s] and that's what triggered this one bug
[233.6s] or it's on a certain app
[235.2s] or a certain operating system or phone,
[237.9s] it behaves in a certain way.
[240.9s] And then also when you get to see the person use it,
[243.2s] you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right?
[244.7s] They're gonna press it.
[245.4s] They're gonna press it.
[246.2s] And then they don't press it.
[247.2s] And you're like, why?
[248.0s] Why did they not press the very clear call to action
[250.8s] that I made?
[251.7s] And so it's just like the only real way,
[254.5s] like you can track things through things
[257.9s] like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer
[259.5s] or right to see like the UX flows,
[261.8s] but you're gonna miss all the little details
[264.3s] of every single user interaction.
[266.4s] And so just being able to track things like that,
[267.9s] able to like watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big portion of what I
[273.0s] think makes our app more successful.

[Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }}):
[275.0s] Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So
[279.1s] if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improve the UX on the
[287.7s] legacy financial system. Like it looks way better. It works. It's not nearly as much of a mess as the
[294.6s] like Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the
[301.0s] best example. But, you know, I think so maybe that's like the baseline expectation. But is
[306.6s] that sort of like the totality of UX? Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is like
[312.6s] there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And,
[319.3s] you know, so what is your take? Like from my understanding, I think you guys are,
[324.6s] you're multi-chain, but like inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too, you know?
[329.4s] So like, what, how do you think about that?

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[332.0s] There's a, there's a lot to fix. I think
[335.9s] you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of, of FinTech generational UX,
[343.8s] UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I
[350.2s] think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI.
[354.6s] And that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. Like the UI, the UI of Venmo is, is sort of even
[361.4s] like almost antiquated in a way, but the UX is done beautifully. And, and that reason is because
[367.5s] it's like the user, they approach it from just like, instead of like a feature, it's just a user
[372.1s] problem. Like what is the user problem? It's like of sending money, right? You open the app,
[375.5s] it's got this big send button and it's just, it's so simple to just like a few clicks to
[379.7s] send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so like, they very much
[383.9s] honed in on that. And I think that's, I think that's a really, really good example of like,
[384.6s] they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how
[389.3s] sexy the UI is. Right. And so with Web3 UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that
[398.5s] goes very deep just to get to parity with with, with traditional finance and FinTech. And that's,
[405.8s] so it's like when it comes to like Web3, for example, and especially with Ethereum,
[409.4s] it's like, okay, we have, we have gas, we have to worry about, we have
[413.3s] token approvals, we have to worry about, we have multi-chain, which we have to worry about.
[418.6s] We have bundled transactions, if there's multiple transactions, right? And so luckily,
[425.1s] all of these things are now, like there are solutions for these, right? Between like 4337
[430.6s] and 7702, there are ways to implement Paymasters, there are ways to bundle transactions together,
[436.3s] there's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. It's like,
[443.3s] PistachioFi We do all of this, right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that
[448.6s] like we don't do, for example, is like maybe within Web3 gaming, there's this concept of
[453.1s] session keys. And it's like, oh, okay, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign
[457.8s] every single transaction for everything that goes, that gets written to the blockchain? It's like,
[462.5s] no, you just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in, basically, as you're signing into
[467.1s] the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your, your, your gaming session. Right?
[473.3s] And so that basically absolves away or extracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that
[480.4s] it takes for like a Web3 company, again, to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to
[485.6s] solve it all. It's just a matter of like, does the app creator understand all of these things?
[492.4s] Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things, right?
[496.3s] Like some of the major apps, or wallets, even like I love, I'm a big Rabby user, they still don't
[503.3s] have these 7702 implemented. Right. And so there's a lot of these like big players that
[506.4s] still don't have these, these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[515.1s] I'm curious, Brian, because like, you know, just to reveal some of the background, right,
[520.7s] when you were working for us, you were like a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX
[525.9s] and product design? I'm glad you know, you've joined the dark side. But it's like, like, what,
[531.8s] what, what got you into UX?
[533.3s] there and you know what what made you feel like okay this is something

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[539.0s] I can take. Well, I've always
[540.7s] honestly really loved the product side. Like I think I had like a natural ability to be a sales
[548.2s] person. Like I love to just chat and create rapport and I think that's very important for
[554.2s] sales and marketing. But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for—I think it
[561.6s] was more of like just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it
[567.9s] and I started to do it, it's one of those—it's like the natural calling, right? Like when you find
[573.5s] something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing
[577.8s] it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days working a website
[583.6s] or whatever it is, right, just because I'm like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve
[591.6s] it and making it a job. Like I don't know, it's like just a different thing. But also
[591.7s] like having UX/UI—it was like some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it
[597.7s] was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing. And I'm sure [Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }})
[604.5s] can—or I mean I think all of you, but both you guys can relate to this—is that once it's yours,
[613.4s] you know there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just like working for
[619.4s] someone. Like, you know, like if you're doing something that kind of—you're kind of going to work
[621.6s] when you work for someone, it's like, oh okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck,
[627.8s] and that's nice. But that's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having
[636.6s] being like aligned of like, okay, if I kill this, like I get monetarily incentivized just because
[641.6s] I killed it and it's my baby, right? So I think that sort of shines a lot in being like a
[649.0s] founder and growing your own application. And then it's just like I have like an obsession
[654.2s] with it, to be honest. Like I have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes
[659.6s] it better and just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth
[666.0s] it over, right? And so I think all of that has just like aggregated to and led me to where I am
[673.6s] today.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[674.0s] And yeah, I mean, we—one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten the
[679.0s] chance to work with some great people and we could always see that you had that sort of
[683.2s] entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out of this. I'm—I, you know, I think one though
[688.3s] challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the
[694.6s] ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong or I don't understand this. Like that seems
[701.3s] to be a big hurdle that, you know, a lot of truly technical people just can't get over.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[708.0s] And it comes down to—which I think maybe is—makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as
[715.4s] well—is that I say like UX is just empathy just like brought to life. Because at the end of the
[722.8s] day, it's like you very, very much need to just be able to put yourself in your users' shoes
[729.1s] and to empathize with, oh okay, like this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated,
[734.4s] which should frustrate you, right? Like if it's going to piss them off, it's going to piss them off—
[738.6s] should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because like if you don't have that empathy,
[743.9s] if you don't have that ability to like also be frustrated, then you're not going to care enough
[749.4s] to fix it, right? It's like you should be pissed if a user is going to be pissed. You should be pissed.

[Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }}):
[755.5s] Yeah, 100%. Who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean,
[764.0s] you know, there's like there's full-on normies, there's crypto native,
[768.6s] there's—but the, you know, absolutely like interesting like age ranges and all that sort
[773.9s] of thing. Because I think maybe both of us, but you know, it's like it's hard to define exactly
[778.8s] like the bucket. Like they probably are crypto friendly, but maybe, you know, anyway.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[785.0s] We will be. Normally we are normie friendly. Like if you want to invite your—your—your—I want to say your
[791.9s] parents, but your dad's a bit, I think, beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto native.
[798.6s] When it comes to like let's say like siblings and family, I want it to be like friendly enough
[802.6s] that you can invite these people without fear of throwing them to the wolves of volatility,
[808.3s] of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls—all these things. And so it's
[813.5s] designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user, my ideal customer,
[819.5s] is probably between the ages of like 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in
[828.6s] crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on-chain, that want to be able to not need
[835.7s] to off-board crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high quality self-custodial, high
[844.4s] security but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values
[851.4s] security, but that also values privacy, and that has the ability then to not let their funds—if
[859.8s] they're going to risk off into stables, for example—be able to easily earn safe, curated, high
[867.7s] quality yield that is at least double of what is U.S. Treasuries without being exposed to equities.
[873.6s] And then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of like,
[879.3s] through just talking to a lot of people,
[881.4s] seems to be the very like bread and butter of people that I think would work very well
[886.2s] of like a customer user base—of people who can at least put five figures into my app, preferably
[893.4s] at least 50 grand into the six figures, that would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because
[899.7s] of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our
[906.4s] users, to trust that as well. But also if you want to like invite your friends, your friends,
[911.4s] family, to make it easy just to get on-chain, this is the easiest way, right?

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[918.0s] So why do you think the UX has been so bad in Web3 for so long?

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[927.0s] I think it's a large disconnect of people building
[930.8s] and people talking to users. Especially a lot of—like I talk to a lot of founders. I love to talk
[936.7s] to founders. I like—I meet so many people. Like one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just
[942.6s] sort of like in that natural like BD aspect is just like I meet so many people and like about
[949.0s] what they're building. And very frequently I'm asked to basically audit people's UX, UIs, just
[956.8s] give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people want
[963.1s] to build an MVP, they want to build fast, they want to build something. And it's like it's a hard
[967.2s] chicken-the-egg problem of like, how do I talk to users? I don't have anything for them to use.
[972.6s] I don't have an MVP if I don't have these. And so people then build in this direction of, okay, well,
[978.6s] I'm just going to build a product and then I'm going to get users, right? And so realistically
[983.4s] what they want to do is they should be like building the product, but as you're building it,
[988.5s] you want to talk to potential users. You want to talk to people who you think this problem is
[994.6s] solving, right? Because it's not just—you shouldn't just be building an app or like a feature set.
[998.2s] Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so like when you're building
[1002.6s] to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like—or people—
[1007.0s] I mean, first your friends, because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like,
[1012.4s] any of you have this problem? Like find friends who have this problem. If you don't, it's not
[1017.4s] necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this
[1021.8s] problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people who have this problem, eventually you're not
[1026.7s] solving a problem, right? Like you're creating a solution in search of a problem.
[1032.6s] Actually, like finding people who would be willing to like test out what you're doing and then show
[1037.6s] them the earliest iterations, right? And so figuring out that—of is this confusing? Is this
[1043.6s] good? Is this bad? Is this specific UX really actually solving the core problem
[1051.2s] that we set out to solve? At the end of the day, luckily, I think a lot of builders these days
[1056.5s] set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their
[1062.6s] earlier careers or usages, right, of that. Let's say you work in like a B2B company or
[1070.7s] you're creating—a founder, maybe you're a founder for a company—you're like, dude, this is such a pain
[1074.8s] in my butt, right, that you're—this one like particular thing. They go on to create a company
[1079.2s] that goes to solve that problem, right? It's like they're dogfooding their own pain.
[1083.1s] Same thing with B2C. And kind of like I love to use crypto and be on-chain and love all of these
[1089.0s] different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me
[1092.6s] to where I am with creating, like, right? Because I would dogfood all these apps
[1098.5s] essentially and just be like, okay, well, this isn't good enough, this isn't good enough. And so I
[1103.5s] think that that's sort of the main reason that creators or app builders—I think they maybe
[1109.6s] try to create something for maybe to be cool or to add a vanity, even, or potentially to chase
[1117.4s] a trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money's going, right? Like people are chasing perps.
[1122.6s] Like there are how many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to
[1126.8s] like go and go out and get money? Also because people, for better or for worse, you know, they try
[1131.7s] to chase that trend because they see that where like the VC money is flowing to. And they say, oh,
[1136.3s] if I can get on that VC train, then I can get the money to build this, right? And like chase that
[1140.7s] trend that maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. And so there's like all—
[1145.4s] they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the
[1149.0s] core of what problem do I want to solve?

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1152.6s] I mean, my kind of theory and one of the challenges Web3 has had is that, you know, in the
[1157.6s] first phase of Web3, really we're just trying to solve technical problems, right, like make
[1163.4s] it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to a sin. And then, but
[1171.5s] those people that can solve like those super hard technical problems are not the kind of
[1176.1s] UX people that can kind of think like, oh, from a user perspective, really, right? They're
[1181.7s] thinking more about,
[1182.6s] okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has kind of
[1187.3s] happened. And, you know, I think you've caught it at the right time.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1192.2s] I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way,
[1194.0s] like towards design, like more like
[1197.4s] hybrid engineers who have that back, like back end, front—I mean just full stack, right, who then
[1202.6s] are now also intrigued in design. And this—because maybe they built their own thing
[1208.1s] from scratch and they had—they were forced to, right, as opposed to just like a straight
[1212.6s] back end engineer who's doing these things. One thing—

[Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }}):
[1215.0s] I'll say I now code again occasionally
[1218.8s] because the AI has gotten so good. And if it has a template, like it's not so good at UX from scratch,
[1224.7s] but if it has something to work from, I'm like, no, just like generate a component like this and
[1229.5s] do this. And it usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much
[1235.6s] less painful than it used to be. Absolutely.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1239.0s] I found with my Web 2 startups and my mobile startup
[1242.6s] that, like, one of the reasons, you know, I was like CTO of the first startups and then I switched
[1247.8s] to product because I realized that, like, hey, by turning step three into step one, I could like
[1253.9s] 10x the usage overnight, right? So it's like that, but it's a totally different mode of thinking than,
[1260.8s] oh, how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things?

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1260.0s] Also, the infrastructure
[1266.3s] really didn't exist for a while. Like I remember vividly, like one time we were at the BlockApps
[1272.3s] office and, Vic, you said in the office, like, like, mobile Web3 sucks. Just—just I—I just—I remember I
[1280.3s] don't even remember that. I just remember you going on about it. And it was true for such a long period
[1284.7s] of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring Web3 to mobile didn't exist for
[1291.3s] the longest time. And this last, like, bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure.
[1298.7s] It's still not good enough, but that's fine,
[1302.3s] all right, always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't
[1308.7s] exist back then, or even just libraries, right, of people being—of having SDKs that are compatible
[1314.9s] with React Native, or just like native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to
[1320.6s] just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that. Like I can't—we can't build
[1325.4s] everything from scratch, dude. Like as much as I would love to have everything in house, especially
[1329.1s] being a mostly bootstrap company, it's like, no, we need the infrastructure, right? And that's what I
[1332.3s] need people to have, like, proper—they need to have like good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, like
[1338.9s] hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to like bash our heads against
[1344.9s] the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1348.0s] I—yeah, I kind of remember that conversation.
[1350.6s] I think one of my frustrations at the time was like talking to some of the Ethereum devs and
[1355.8s] they were like, yeah, we have a mobile solution. We're gonna run a node on your phone. It was like,
[1361.8s] do you know, like, battery life is important to me? I know this is the last of the day.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[1368.0s] This is where I started, remember?

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1372.0s] Yes, you tried to run it on a watch, man.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[1375.0s] Smartwatch. That was my first project, was seeing if I could get cpp-ethereum running on a smartwatch.
[1381.7s] And I didn't—that. But Geth worked. Geth worked on a smartwatch. And it was because it was so
[1387.9s] early, right, that the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about
[1391.8s] workable. And now there's a thought at the time, well, you know, yeah, we're gonna have like a light
[1396.4s] client thing. There isn't yet, but, you know, we'll get that going. And same thing with on the
[1401.9s] desktop, right, with Mist. You know, Mist—Mist having embedded. Yeah, it was just a thought
[1408.3s] that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit slow, but, you know, we'll optimize it. It'll get 10x, it'll get 100x.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1413.8s] Yeah, none of those people have ever built a mobile app before, obviously.
[1439.0s] You're gonna have—
[1421.8s] every router, it will just be like an OS level sort of service.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1426.0s] Building a mobile app sucks.
[1427.1s] It's hard. It's really hard.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1430.0s] Getting approved by Apple especially. Oh, that's like a—that's like a nightmarish—

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1434.9s] I think that was the easy part, dude. That was good. It's like that's hard, but that was the
[1440.4s] easy part. It's like building a Web3 app that's multi-chain on multiple operating systems is just—
[1448.2s] the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare.
[1451.8s] That's like been the hardest part. Like our last—like we launched in June, or like May, June, and
[1457.5s] then literally all summer was just like hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over edge case.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[1463.6s] And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1470.0s] Thank you. Publicly at
[1471.4s] least, you know, we've been—we've been like—I'm a big soft launch guy if you can. We're always
[1476.1s] probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah,
[1481.8s] so Android took a while, like months longer than Apple, because it's much easier to
[1488.7s] develop on Apple, right? It's like everything's standardized. Everything just works across every
[1492.8s] single device. On Android, it's like, okay, you have to worry about—basically you have to worry about
[1499.0s] like optimizations going back far enough to like Android 12 to cover like 90% of use cases.
[1505.2s] 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd.
[1511.8s] And if you're doing that, you also have to worry about hardware optimizations, right, to make sure
[1516.2s] that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on, like, very like base level Android devices,
[1522.8s] right, because they cost very low and most of the world has a lot of these just like really cheap
[1527.8s] devices. Okay? So you can't like load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the
[1532.5s] amount of like different, like screen types, and like getting, like, the edge to edge display to
[1537.0s] work via like React Native Expo was also not working very well.
[1541.8s] And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use
[1547.0s] React Native Expo. Maybe they have like native to each device. And so there's not even
[1553.0s] like good libraries that help on Expo for this, like—like Expo just launched, like, edge to edge
[1560.0s] display like two months ago, like—like—like these things still aren't very public. And so my CTO even
[1566.8s] wants to launch a library, like a publicly available
[1571.8s] repo, just to help with all of these—all these hardships that we had to go through firsthand,
[1577.3s] essentially.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1580.0s] Yeah, I remember, you know, my last company was a mobile company. To make sure things
[1583.2s] ran on like iOS, we ran it on two devices in the simulator. We had a table of Android devices,
[1590.8s] like, and just to kind of like test all the configurations. But in fact,
[1594.0s] there's probably—
[1595.7s] I don't know, ten thousand, more than ten thousand different—

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1595.0s] Like, yeah, I got this—

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1601.0s] Yeah, I mean,
[1601.8s] I got a couple over here too. But like, you know, like TVs and tablets and whatever, right? They're
[1608.6s] all different. And they're all—I—I'm really curious, like, you know, when you made that evolution to a
[1614.1s] founder, as you were talking about before, what—what was the biggest challenge that you faced, do
[1619.0s] you think? The biggest challenge—

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1631.0s] It evolves over time, right? Like as I level up as a founder,
[1632.1s] the challenges get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and
[1633.8s] bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision.
[1640.5s] It's like I have this vision in my head and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect
[1646.7s] from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so
[1652.3s] that's why I learned UX, UI design, was so I can, like, literally just like put it into a Figma
[1656.4s] and show someone and be like, this is what I want, right? Like, this is how I foresee it. And so that
[1661.8s] was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO
[1663.8s] on board because he's like, I love this idea. Let's do it. So then we did that. And then the next
[1667.3s] challenge was the architecture, right? And so then the architectural solution of vendor selection,
[1672.9s] which I was talking to someone early today about—this vendor selection's a nightmare. Like I luckily
[1678.5s] already knew what chain I wanted to work on and what, like, and how I wanted to be like multi-chain.
[1683.8s] So that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be like a robust multi-chain application, this is
[1689.0s] pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use like account abstraction and
[1693.8s] smart accounts. Like very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era.
[1698.6s] And so, like, the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited.
[1704.2s] And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about like key storage and how do we do recovery and
[1708.0s] how do we keep people safe. And like these are all the different vendors. Like for all—every different—
[1712.4s] there's a different decision for a different vendor at each part of the stack. And
[1717.7s] being able to basically understand Web3 deep enough to understand the trade-offs of each
[1722.7s] different vendor, and then be able to basically understand the trade-offs of each different vendor
[1723.8s] and what they bring. And, okay, well, what's the price? Because we're unfunded, right? So I have to
[1727.8s] make sure it works within my realm of my budget, while also being able to make sure it's like
[1733.3s] scalable in the long term if we—if we—if we do go into this thing. And then, how do we do—how do we
[1738.9s] do—do we do things to be modular? Do we do things to go like purely vertical stacked? Does that lock
[1744.0s] us in as a vendor? Do we want to be more modular? And—and then we've had opportunity—we've had
[1748.8s] moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performing enough,
[1753.8s] lead enough, you know? And so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us
[1759.4s] back in delivery time, right? So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as like
[1766.0s] literally a two-person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full-time engineer last
[1770.9s] month. But like it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time. And like, thank God that I
[1777.2s] understand like blockchain architecture as deeply as I do, or my CTO would have—it would have been—
[1783.3s] and all of this would have been on him. And it made it much easier being able to share that
[1787.6s] experience.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[1789.0s] That's awesome. But yeah, it's—it's—as you say, every—every step there's a new challenge.
[1795.8s] But, you know, I think it's also like just kind of being excited. Like you—you work really, really
[1802.2s] hard, as we can see. So, like, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to
[1808.1s] with this project and just in general.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1811.0s] Thank you. So, yeah.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[1812.0s] So, yeah,
[1813.3s] looking at the time, Brian, so let me just ask you one last question, perhaps.
[1819.5s] When—when are we ready for the normies?

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1820.0s] We're already ready for the normies. At least
[1825.8s] Pistachio is, right? We can—we made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You
[1833.2s] don't have to worry about seed phrases. You don't have to worry about even having your
[1836.9s] phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in programmatic ways, in
[1843.3s] secure ways as well, that's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so,
[1851.2s] but at least the next—the next wave of updates that we're going to be doing is going to be really
[1855.6s] cool too, I think. Like it's just like the ability to—essentially the alpha is, like, the ability to
[1862.3s] send bank transfers from an on-chain account, like, to specific—change—like, accounts all over the
[1868.1s] world for very, very cheap. So, like, stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves
[1873.3s] the real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before, literally what I've been talking
[1878.0s] about. Like crypto—one. And even to tie it all in for the "Is better Web3 UX the key to
[1886.0s] mainstream adoption?" And I don't think it is, right? It's like better UX is the key to any
[1892.5s] app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big. But there needs to
[1897.9s] be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day.
[1903.3s] So, like, I said before, like the, hey, it's okay to send an on-chain transaction,
[1903.5s] but right now if I'm not able to send an on-chain transaction—it's okay to send an on-chain
[1903.6s] transaction because it's my ability—my ability to send an on-chain transaction
[1906.4s] and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or Spay transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar—
[1913.7s] like, that's—that's significant pain being solved. Because, like, most common applications right now
[1919.6s] that do it are, let's say, like Dollar App or Felix. And they do it for like a three dollar flat fee,
[1924.2s] which is still pretty expensive for—considering if you want to send money to someone. If you only want to send in small amounts, right, it's like a hundred dollars a month or so,
[1933.3s] that's a three percent fee that's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits, no caps.
[1940.0s] You can send fifty thousand dollars for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails, or if you want to just keep it on-chain and keep it in Pistachio.
[1949.3s] Right. It's free, unlimited, as we all know, how you can like send money in crypto land.
[1955.0s] Right? You can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents.
[1959.4s] And on Pistachio, every—all the peer to peer transactions are free.
[1962.4s] So I think we're ready for normies right now, but it's just about increasing the amount of—increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains.
[1977.3s] Painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[1982.6s] OK, well, thank you very much.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1984.0s] Thank you guys for having me.
[1986.8s] Yeah, I know you got to run.

[Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }}):
[1989.7s] I hope that at least some of us will be at some of the international events.
[1994.7s] Maybe we can catch up there.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[1996.0s] Yeah, perfect.
[1997.0s] Please, if you guys are going to eat for that time in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them.

[Victor]({{ '/people/victor-wing/' | relative_url }}):
[2000.9s] So we will definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person.
[2005.0s] And I want to see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[2008.8s] Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Take care.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[2011.6s] OK, thanks so much.

[Brian](https://x.com/BSmokes_):
[2013.0s] Thanks. It's great to meet you, Bob.

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }})
[2016.0s] You too. Cheers.
