[150.8s] **SPEAKER_00:** What's going on, everybody?
[152.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Alex, I, sent you, invite to speak
[156.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** and cohost.
[167.5s] **SPEAKER_00:** If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
[180.0s] **SPEAKER_00:** Good to see the faces piling in.
[182.9s] **SPEAKER_00:** Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
[195.5s] **SPEAKER_00:** Here. There we go.
[199.7s] **SPEAKER_00:** Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.
[212.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions,
[217.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** just feel free to raise your hand.
[236.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** Kinda.
[240.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Kinda a bit, like, underwatery.
[278.9s] **SPEAKER_00:** Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay.
[282.4s] **SPEAKER_00:** Let me see.
[296.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** Just give us a few moments moments, guys, trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience.
[322.5s] **SPEAKER_00:** Technology.
[331.9s] **SPEAKER_00:** Cartoons, you wanna come up?
[336.9s] **SPEAKER_00:** I'll invite you.
[338.6s] **SPEAKER_00:** Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak.
[344.6s] **SPEAKER_00:** You are here for episode zero, so
[379.8s] **SPEAKER_00:** About you.
[381.5s] **SPEAKER_00:** Got you, Mac.
[403.0s] **SPEAKER_00:** Wish that my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.
[416.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** You should sing, AG.
[420.4s] **SPEAKER_00:** Who's who said that? Alex? Hey.
[423.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Hey. You should you should play some live music.
[427.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** I I I was playing some classical music, but,
[432.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** yeah. No. It's it's good to have you on here. I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on.
[439.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[443.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** So, really, I just wanna kinda just pick your brain a bit about about the past, honestly. Like,
[449.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** more than just, you know, Mistcoin
[451.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** in general, but really just, like,
[454.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot. So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum, and what was your
[464.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** kind of first initial reaction to it?
[468.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Sure. I I have to say, my wife think it's it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists
[477.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** now.
[478.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** So I find it I find it funny. A little bit weird, but it's it's fun.
[484.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** So,
[486.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** I I think so I started
[489.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** being interested in the 19 Bitcoin around 2012.
[494.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** So that was
[496.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** in like, it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I I already felt like, oh god. I missed it. They're already talking about Bitcoin on the good wife on on live TV.
[508.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** I like, oh, no. But, like, it it used to be under a dollar. Now it's, like, $10.
[514.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right? That's too bad.
[518.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I I even remember, like, I posted something on the forums saying, oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at five dollars. I paid.
[526.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** It was so hard.
[527.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then someone simply, like, I think,
[530.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** tipped me, like, 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, hey. Here's
[534.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin. And it was, like, back then, I don't know,
[541.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, probably a full Bitcoin. Right?
[545.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** So, like, Bitcoin was $5
[547.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** back then. So that was that that was those early days. Uh-huh.
[553.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Again,
[554.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** didn't feel too early.
[557.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then
[558.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I started paying attention
[560.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come,
[565.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** for Bitcoin.
[566.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I just started following all sort of projects, like, colored coin,
[572.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Master coin, and things like that. Uh-huh. And so I found it here. And I was, wow, I was so blown away and captivated
[581.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** that I couldn't think of anything else. And I the the
[585.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** people were still very active on the Reddit. Like, Vitalik would answer
[590.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** questions personally.
[592.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then I just start helping out on the forum or on the Reddit.
[596.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I'm I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, hey. Like, there are enough coders here. Maybe they this is they need a designer, and then someone would ask something for a presentation I could give them.
[608.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started
[613.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** having cash hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got
[620.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** I started working with some some crazy people.
[624.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** So you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved
[627.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of
[631.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** jumping in and and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.
[638.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** I certainly didn't expect it to like,
[641.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** sort of yes and no because I felt it back then.
[645.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** It was it seemed very obvious that he was going to be a big thing, and I was like, I'm I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this. I was like, can't I I I felt like telling everybody I knew, can't you see? Look at this shit. This is this is crazy. It's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside, and people were, like,
[667.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** think like, people are acting as as a crazy as if it was crazy. Like, I
[674.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** I I was a founder of a company back then. I was doing, like, an iPhone app, sort of, like, Instagram with professionalistas,
[681.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** and I had raised money with, like but the the app wasn't going anywhere, and I realized that I wasn't
[687.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about it all the time.
[695.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then I told my friends that I I wanted to leave this. They were like, are you, like, leaving the app you founded to work for a 19 year old? They're going to pay you in, like, makeup money that he invented.
[709.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** I was like, yeah. Sure. That that seems like a great idea.
[714.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That that's,
[716.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** that's crazy, man. That's honestly the I mean, just your your,
[720.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, your belief in in what this could turn out to ended up leading you to such, you know, success and a a pine you know, being a pioneer
[728.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** in this space.
[730.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kinda helped assemble
[735.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** the Miss Wallet development team. You explained you were part of, like, the hiring,
[741.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** and you brought Fabian on board. How did you go about, like, getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?
[752.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** So when I started working so,
[755.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** the first
[756.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** person I started were talking about working was was with Gavin Wood. Gavin Wood was the one who I sort of introduced me to the idea of of making a a a browser, like, a I
[770.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** I would say that really my the way I got to work was I downloaded what
[775.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** what what was the, like, latest client CPP,
[778.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** the c plus plus client.
[780.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then it was called LF zero.
[782.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And if you ever you should try to Google how would that look like because it it was
[789.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** it felt like,
[791.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** the command of, an Airbus. Like, a lot lots of small windows
[797.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** setting showing all sort of, like, buttons and things you had to push. It was super complex. But I I still look at it and say, woah. This is like a fantastic app. I wish it was simpler to use.
[808.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I designed something which which was very similar to what the missed wallet looked like. And then I was very proud showing that to to Gav.
[818.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** And he he called me to have a Skype call, and then he told me, look. I I I I thought I I had basically retransformed the whole thing. And he told me, no. I I think you you're not going far enough. I think you're not thinking big enough
[832.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** about this. I was like, look. I I took this thing that was weird, and I made it something that looks usable. It looks like a blockchain which were like, that that's what it is. Right? You it's a blockchain, but instead of sending coins, you send contracts and you execute stuff. And it was like, no.
[851.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** This is going to be the foundation of a new web. And we are calling this Webtree, and it's there's going to be a browser, and there's going to be, like, client interfaces.
[861.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And you're gonna download it via torrent or via,
[866.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** or via Swarm. You're gonna talk to people directly via PGP. It's going to be, like it's going to replace
[874.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** the Internet
[875.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** browser as we know it. It's going to be like, it's going to be better than Onion, and it's it's,
[881.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** now you're gonna download apps directly. Instead of downloading the apps for a server, you're going to do that that'd be down downloading it from your peers, from your friends so apps would never go online. And I was like, wow. This is this is crazy. I wanna be a part of this.
[896.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then I I got into the Jeff Jeff team. Right? There was basically three teams in the early days of foundation. It was Vitalik, Jeff, and Gav. Vitalik was doing
[907.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** was working in Python, was mostly almost a research part
[911.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** in which was mostly interested in in knowing if the thing worked.
[915.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** And Gavin and Jeff really were doing the the hard clients, one in
[921.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** in Go Ethereum and the other in c plus plus.
[924.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And when I joined the guest team, it were I was, like, the third person to join the guest team. It was, like, Jeff,
[931.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Felix,
[932.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Victor Tron, which then became the head of form, and then me, right, or something like that.
[939.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I started trying to, like, build an interface on top of that, and it was very hard. It was very complicated.
[948.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I asked Jeff, look, Jeff. I think if you wanted to really build the wallet, we need someone who
[954.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** can has a lot of experience building apps with with with on the web. Right? Something that you can use CSF. You can use
[963.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** custom, like, JavaScript
[965.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** to to build apps. Not only build the the app itself, but to build the app inside that.
[971.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And he was like, yep. I know just the guy. Like, there's there's this
[975.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** crazy guy that that came up on on a few on a few,
[982.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** meetups. He was talk very excited about the,
[985.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** and we don't know what to do with him, but maybe he know he can help.
[990.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then that's how I started working with with Fabian. I called him,
[995.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** and, like, in theory, he was working for me, but I I guess he never never got the memo because he was, like, he was bossing me around and giving orders, and it was great. Right? The way it worked would be that I would often come up with an idea, and then I would tell him, I think we'll we should do this. And he was like, no. I I don't think that that's going to work. And then I was going to no. No. I think I think it is going to work, and I modified my idea a little bit. And then told, like, gave him back to him. And then he came to me, and I still don't think it is going to work. We should do this instead. And then at some point, on the on the debate going back and forth, we would come to a very usable solution
[1035.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** that he was able to implement, like, in a day. He was very good at implementing stuff very quickly that and that made me very, like,
[1045.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** impressed by by Fabian. Right? He's he was a fantastic holder. He wrote the book on what was the,
[1052.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** the standard of web development back then. Like, back then, everybody was talking about Meteor, and he, like, basically wrote a book on Meteor.
[1060.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** That was there was great work with him.
[1064.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Wow. That's that's that's amazing. I didn't realize he he wrote a book.
[1070.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** He wrote like, he wrote the book,
[1072.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** like, a book before,
[1073.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** getting into web three just about regular, like, web two development?
[1077.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. You wrote a book on web web web two development.
[1081.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Like, back then, everybody was using all sorts of
[1085.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** JavaScript
[1088.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** libraries to build webs.
[1090.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think the meter was the one thing that you used to if you wanted to have, like, a single page application. Right? You wanted
[1097.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** to have
[1099.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** a a a web page that looks like an application, which is the standard today. Every page look like an application, but back then, it was actually very hard to do.
[1108.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** And Meteor was a very
[1110.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** popular library.
[1112.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Fabian basically wrote a book on Meteor.
[1116.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** So he was he was very deep into that.
[1119.3s] **SPEAKER_00:** Wow.
[1120.2s] **SPEAKER_00:** That's that's super interesting.
[1123.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** So,
[1124.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** who's, like, whose idea
[1126.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** was it to kinda
[1128.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** make this make a fun little token to test the features and, like, give it away
[1133.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** to users on Reddit? And why
[1136.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** pick Reddit
[1137.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** rather than, like, Bitcoin talk, which was, like, what was predominantly used back then.
[1145.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Just
[1147.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** So here's the thing. Right?
[1149.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** We didn't use Bitcoin Talk at all. We were using Reddit because Reddit was we used two two main forums. It was the forum.egmail.org,
[1158.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** which is which is doesn't exist anymore,
[1162.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** and there was Reddit. Right? That was the main form of communication.
[1166.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And we think about Bitcoin talk where people would launch
[1170.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** new coins and and projects, but we weren't launching a new project of coin. So let's talk about tokens in the first place. Right?
[1178.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Where does the idea of making tokens
[1181.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** come?
[1182.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Well,
[1183.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** that has always been there. In fact,
[1187.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** the first use
[1188.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** of,
[1190.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, the I I I think one one of the things that is on the white paper,
[1194.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** one of the first things on the white paper is is can be used to to do to do tokens.
[1201.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** And they and that became obvious because what was happening back then, it was it was Bitcoin. And then whenever someone wanted to launch
[1209.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** invented the new thing to build on top of it, they would launch a whole new token. Mhmm. So they were like, oh, I wanna do this blockchain thing, but I wanna use it
[1218.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** for storing names.
[1220.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then they launched a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin. Yep. And then someone else thought, oh, you know what? We should have property
[1228.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** assets inside here.
[1230.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** We could and then they launched Colored Coin, which was a a whole new thing. They tried to do on at some point, it was on top of Bitcoin,
[1238.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** then it wasn't.
[1239.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then someone
[1241.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** someone started doing and then Mastercoin was like, oh, no. I think what we should do is that we should have
[1248.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** an exchange inside. So you you can send the coin or ask for an exchange or send the token.
[1255.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** And, basically, every time anyone wanted to do something new, they had to make a new opcode for Mastercoin.
[1263.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And Vitalik was working with Mastercoin and colored coins back then. And and that's when so it started to realize that's that's very inefficient, the idea that you have to either release a whole new blockchain whenever you someone else thinks about a new feature
[1278.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** or that you need to, like, create a whole new
[1281.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** new upgrade to
[1283.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** your blockchain.
[1284.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** So
[1288.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** I'm
[1292.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** I think you might have rubbed there.
[1296.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** Can't hear you.
[1298.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Is it just me, Mac? Can you hear him?
[1300.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** No. That's a
[1407.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Alright. Let's see.
[1409.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Alright. Good. I'm I'm back. Here. Alright. Awesome.
[1413.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So
[1415.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** I don't even know where you left off.
[1417.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I was talking about tokens.
[1419.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Talking about tokens. Yeah.
[1423.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** I might have only one who heard
[1425.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** who couldn't understand anything that Mac said because he was very distorted. Or Yeah. He was a bit distorted. I don't know what's going on with that.
[1434.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.
[1437.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Okay.
[1438.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** So yeah. So you were talking about,
[1441.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** like, you know, Mastercoin
[1443.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** and those types
[1444.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** of projects, and you had to, like, you know, release a whole
[1447.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** token and stuff. I was just I was asking more about, like,
[1451.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** who decided to just, like,
[1454.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** play with the missed token and just, like, oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit. Like Well, that's what I'm getting at. Right? So we knew tokens are important. And then at some point, I post like, we decided, hey. We we want to do a token
[1469.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** release on this.
[1470.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I posted on Reddit, like, hey. Let's talk about, the coin,
[1475.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** standard. Let's talk about something. There was a very interesting conversation
[1479.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** out of that.
[1480.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** Based on that conversation,
[1482.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Fabian wrote
[1484.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** the
[1485.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** wrote, like, the ERC standard.
[1489.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** And when we we released the and and then when we released the the the new missed wallet, we wanted people to try out because there were no tokens on Ethereum. Like, there was nothing you could tokenize.
[1502.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** So we basically released two tokens. One came with the wallet and was the Unicorn thing. Whenever you donate it to the foundation, you got a Unicorn.
[1511.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** And the other
[1512.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** that we wanted people to be able to play with it for free was just, like,
[1516.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** something that Fabian
[1518.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** created,
[1521.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** literally for fun just using, like, the standard thing that they had Mhmm. And then just started giving away for on Reddit just for people to try it out. Mhmm.
[1530.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Like, nobody nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just this is the best thing that we wanna try out
[1536.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** and wanted people to play around with.
[1539.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** Of course. Yeah. No. I I get it. And in regards to the Unicorn, the Unicorn token was, like,
[1545.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** five, six months later, though. Right?
[1547.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** Is it?
[1548.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts, I don't know if it was Really? It I didn't know I don't know if it was, like, talked about, like, internally, but not released until later. But, yeah, it was released in 2016,
[1560.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** couple months. I think it was two or three months.
[1563.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** And I I think unicorns are great too, but, I mean, I I I can't they're very hard to get ahold of. So yeah. I mean
[1571.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** As as you say, like, trust trust the time stamp. Right? I mean, I like, if you were asking me, I would swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the the tokens on the wallet.
[1584.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** Maybe we hadn't that.
[1586.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that you did, but the thing is that,
[1590.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Unicorn is actually, like, an ERC 20,
[1594.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** quote, unquote, actually an ERC 20 because Mist is basically
[1597.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** an ERC 20 besides the approved function.
[1601.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** So it was like, that's why if you go look at the unicorns,
[1606.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** I'm pretty sure they have all of the
[1609.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** ERC 20,
[1610.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** standard implemented,
[1612.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** whereas a mist is basically like the bit like, the skeleton for it. You know? It's just missing a few parts or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC 20, but Fabian consist considers
[1624.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** it. I think you had a, you know, a good,
[1628.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** outlook on exactly, you know, how I met the standard and besides the approval function.
[1633.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** But, yeah,
[1634.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** that that's that's super,
[1636.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** super interesting.
[1637.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kinda helped
[1642.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** in, like, whether it be, like, just ideating or actually getting in there and coding? Because I know you said you didn't you weren't really a coder that kinda helped with the, figuring out this ERC 20 standard. Was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned,
[1656.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Gavin Wood. I didn't know if he was kinda
[1659.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** in the coding side of things too, or was it really just, like, Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it? Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community,
[1669.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** in regards on on how to build,
[1672.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** the tokens.
[1673.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** There there were a lot of some projects that I think
[1677.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** the guys from Maker now
[1679.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** or I I think Rune was already,
[1681.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, participating on that.
[1683.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** From Maker now.
[1685.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** He was already saying, look. We we have this project.
[1689.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Second, we we already released
[1691.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** a big number of tokens, and that that that was, like they they were claiming about, like, other token that they they they were working on on that project that they had. And, of course, there was no standard for that, and that that's sort of why we wanted,
[1705.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Sure. But you release a token, but that doesn't mean that like, it we need a standard so that everyone can release tokens, and those tokens can exist on wallets and things like that.
[1715.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** But I think so Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole the community as a whole,
[1720.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** that, like,
[1722.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** wrote the wrote standard, and those things were very
[1727.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** it it it was a very participatory
[1729.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** project. Right? So this writing a standard is
[1733.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** by by its design, something that you want to have the buying of the community. You want to have a lot of feedback
[1740.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** so that everyone can, at some point, just agree
[1745.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** on something. Right? So it's not something that you just come out and say, hey. He did it how the foundation is going to do. No. We we wanna hear it, and we wanna make sure that everyone is following the standard.
[1755.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** Otherwise, it won't be a standard. We we just prepare for that.
[1761.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.
[1762.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That kinda leads me into my next question is, did you believe, like, ERC 20
[1768.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** would,
[1770.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** kind of achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here, like, ten years later, or did you expect a better or newer standard
[1780.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** to come around?
[1782.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** We knew the tokens
[1784.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** were super important for each year. Right?
[1788.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Like, back when we were working on the missed wallet,
[1791.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** basically, all other crypto wallets served for, like, every every other
[1797.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** especially every other each year in wallet
[1799.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** had one function in mind, which was you up you you get the wallet you
[1805.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** got from the presale.
[1807.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** You
[1808.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** you you get your eater, and you send it to exchange to sell. Right? Or you just bought something in an exchange and you send it to yourself. That was the only reason that anyone would use a wallet.
[1821.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And we were, like and there there were, like, a lot of already other wallets back then, and all of them were just that. Right? It was just a way for you to get
[1831.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** your eater back and sell it.
[1833.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** And we really wanted to to fix that by and and we knew that, look, if you wanted people to use Ethereum as we wanted, we need to create those functions. We need to invent new cool stuff that people want to work, and that's why it was really important for us to to start working on tokens.
[1853.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** Like, did you expect
[1855.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** the ERC 20?
[1857.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** Here's something funny that I didn't expect. Right? So we really expect
[1861.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** tokens themselves to be big.
[1864.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** I did not expect
[1865.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** the word ERC 20 to be so big. Right? The point,
[1870.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** that
[1872.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** Bitcoin tokens are known as BRC
[1875.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** 20 Mhmm. Which is sort of, like, laughable because
[1879.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** it was
[1880.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, it wasn't the 20 of anything.
[1884.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Right? 20 doesn't mean tokens.
[1886.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** 20 was just a random number
[1888.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** that happened to be the order which Fabian asked the questions of. So and suddenly, like,
[1896.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** b or c 20 becomes the center. I think that's
[1900.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** hilarious
[1901.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** honestly. Yeah. I mean, that's,
[1904.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** imitation
[1905.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** is a serious form of flattery.
[1907.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** They, it's it's kinda even though those, like, BRC twenties don't even have, like, smart contracts or anything like that, it's a totally different
[1915.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** kind of tech.
[1917.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** It's just it just pays homage to the fact of how, you know, important the ERC 20 was to kinda, you know, the development of the tech. I mean, you're a pioneer. I mean, you, Fabian, everyone that was a part of this, like, you guys created something.
[1931.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** Like, even though the miss miss wallet went and, you know, sunsetted at some point, like,
[1936.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** the the, you know,
[1937.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** the mark you guys had on on on just cryptocurrency
[1941.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** in blockchain in the world is it's honestly really nuts, and it's crazy that you weren't even really expecting it to have, you know, that much
[1950.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** Let me say a little bit. Because you keep calling me a pioneer and how, like, how everything we did. I think whenever you get
[1958.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** the new community,
[1960.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** right,
[1960.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** you find that it's always, like it's very few people working there. Right? Whenever
[1967.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** when when I got there, there was probably less than a 100 people
[1970.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** working on anything Ethereum.
[1972.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** So anything you do, if you if you start working on a project and then that project becomes big,
[1979.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** then
[1980.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** all those little marks that you do, of course, they also become big, and they also create ripples.
[1987.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** And you can trace that ripple back to the the person that were there. But the thing is
[1994.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** those ripples only matter because the project grew grew and the project grows because a lot of
[2001.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** thousands of factors. Right?
[2004.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** So I think
[2005.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think the main
[2007.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** I would say that if someone
[2010.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** if if if someone thinks about it, wow. I I I don't.
[2014.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** But here's the cool thing is that there's at any point in history, there are thousand, a million other projects
[2022.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** that are happening or things that are happening, which will eventually grow. Like, we can look back and say, oh, this thing became big, and therefore, the people there
[2032.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** were special because they were there. But my point is if if you all you guys are people who care about,
[2040.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, leaving ripples and things like that, I my suggestion would be, like, just find projects that will
[2048.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** that
[2048.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** that will allow that they will grow and you allow
[2051.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** those ripples to be to be big. Right? I I don't think it's the action of those pioneers are super important, etcetera. It's just that we we happen to be there, and we did a a work that I was proud of. But
[2065.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** and I think those opportunities are always coming.
[2068.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Right?
[2069.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** No. Yeah. I agree. And it's it's just about,
[2072.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, building really at the end of the day and and building in something you're passionate about. But regardless of the fact you're a pioneer,
[2079.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** a lot of people agree. So maybe you weren't going into that with the mindset of, hey. I'm a pioneer. You're just in there, you know, building,
[2086.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, trying to do cool stuff apart of something that you think had a lot of potential.
[2090.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** And that to me is is a definition of pioneer whether you whether you
[2095.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** had that mindset going into it, but, I think we all appreciate here you here and what you've done. But that that that would be my suggestion. Right? If if if anyone wants to,
[2106.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, if anyone wants to, like, own a part of history, the best way to do it is to invent it and is to help write it. Right? I think that is the the beauty part. It is so I really urge everyone who, like, loves to look back at history is also to think that in twenty years, whatever you do now will be part of history. Right?
[2127.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** So just, like, try to think enough. Try to think about, like, what is where you wanna be right now that probably can be something big in the future because that's exciting. And even if you bet on the wrong horse,
[2140.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** just betting just just being able to build things that last and don't last is is a great experience. I built tons of things that were forgotten and didn't last and
[2151.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** disappeared
[2152.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** over the years
[2153.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** before I I, like, stumbled in into Ethereum. And even the things I built into tier, I would say that almost all the projects I built
[2162.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** were things that didn't last and they broke down.
[2166.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** But the building blocks that we sort of accidentally created
[2170.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** to build those things
[2172.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** became much bigger than the projects
[2175.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** I was building I had expected to be. Right? Things like the token,
[2179.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** things like ENS,
[2181.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** things
[2182.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, like,
[2183.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** block like, the standards
[2185.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** for
[2186.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** a a lot of, like, small things like the icon that you use color icon you see on on Etherscan.
[2191.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Those things were just a tiny
[2193.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** feature for the wallet,
[2195.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** and they became
[2197.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** big project in themselves, much bigger than the wallet could have to be. And I think that's that is super fun.
[2203.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, you're you're motivating
[2207.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** me right now to get out there and build.
[2209.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** I I I I really appreciate it. Well, I should. Yeah. Everybody should really build. I mean, at the end of the day, like like you said, like, you might as well put a bet out there instead of not even jumping in the game. I mean, you know, who knows? You could be one of those pioneers. You could change the game even even though you're just building something
[2226.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** that you you know might not change the game, but at least, you know, you're in there actually trying to make a difference in something you're passionate about.
[2234.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** But, yeah. No. That's that's great. I like that kinda leads me to the question you were just mentioning some of it. Like,
[2240.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** outside of, like, the creation of the ERC 20
[2243.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** and even ENS, what do you think
[2246.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** was your greatest contribution
[2248.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** in those early days? I know there was the development of the things like the the web three s,
[2254.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** the web three JS library,
[2257.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** the easy to use wall interface, the blocky Identicon,
[2261.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** and camel case checksum.
[2263.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** I know those were a lot of great developments. Is it one of those, or is it, like, potentially something else that I didn't mention?
[2274.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** I
[2275.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** so
[2276.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** something like, I I'm very proud of all of that. Right? But there's another very interesting project that I think what I did after,
[2285.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, the foundation is I started working a project,
[2288.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** which I called Unilogin,
[2290.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** which was another project that went nowhere.
[2293.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** But, also, a lot of the ideas that were there are starting to come around, and I think those those would be super important.
[2300.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** Right?
[2301.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** And what I wanted to do on Unilogin was I wanted everyone to stop using private keys for their
[2309.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** for their
[2311.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** for their crypto. Right? I was I thought it, like, private keys, some
[2315.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** was something that wasn't user
[2318.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** that a user should never see.
[2320.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And and my point was I feel that everyone should have the smart wallets and that a private key was something that your device created
[2328.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** never took out of the device. And whenever you lost that device, you just replace
[2332.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** it with another one.
[2334.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** And so we I I worked for two years on smart wallets and things like that.
[2339.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** Then at some point,
[2341.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** they we hit the wall in which creating a smart wallet would cost you 500 like, a $100 just to acquire a new user. We had to close down the company.
[2350.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** But a lot of those the idea that I I spent, like, two years talking, and I'm going to
[2356.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** I'm trying to share
[2358.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** and trying to, like,
[2360.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** try and talk about in conferences.
[2362.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** Or
[2363.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** now finally without
[2365.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** you and things like that becoming real.
[2367.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** Because,
[2368.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** people are, like today, the the word is, like, account obstruction.
[2373.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Right? And I think
[2374.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** it's still one of the most important things to happen
[2378.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** on if you wanted blockchains to go mainstream
[2381.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** would be for users' nest that never have to care about private keys again. Right? Where you you just have a name,
[2390.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** and that name is connected to a couple of multiple devices.
[2395.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And
[2396.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** and you basically use one device to allow you to use the other. Right? And I think we've
[2402.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** we've
[2403.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** and I think we are probably reaching a moment where this will be able to to be done. Right? But we have not only
[2410.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** cheaper l twos that allow you to have more wallet.
[2413.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** We have
[2414.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** it's easier for you to
[2416.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** deploy as have already the address of a smart contract that is can be deployed in all l twos at the same time. We have FastKeys,
[2425.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** which is a crypto standard that is that is accepted by
[2430.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** by Android and by Apple devices,
[2433.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** which
[2434.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** is really great,
[2436.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** log in.
[2437.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And I think it's,
[2440.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** like,
[2441.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** and I I'm that's something I I've been very happy to see
[2446.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** grow on on crypto.
[2448.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** Well, yes. I am I am proud of all the other achievements you you
[2453.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** said.
[2454.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** No. Yeah. That's that's actually really interesting because,
[2458.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** I'm actually developing some stuff now, and my developer constantly talks to me about how big account abstraction is going to be for this next,
[2467.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** bull run,
[2468.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, bull run and stuff like that. And
[2471.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** it's it it's really fascinating to hear that you were actually working on something like this a few
[2477.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** years ago, was it? Or, like, in 2018.
[2480.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. 2018 was the first time I even talked about that. I think you were just ahead of your time, to be honest. You know? Like, that is really because it's it's huge when it comes to onboarding
[2491.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** new, like, users, quote, unquote, normies
[2494.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** because, like, nobody wants to, you know, have to to store their private key and worry about all that nonsense.
[2501.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** And you were working on it back in 2018. It was just maybe the space
[2505.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** hasn't mature wasn't mature enough then, and it's obviously, it wasn't to a point where now it is. And,
[2512.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** damn, that sucks. I would really like to see, maybe,
[2515.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Unilogin make a comeback.
[2517.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I'm pretty sure thing like, it all the thing I wanted
[2521.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** to to function for will will exist.
[2524.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** I'm I'm very happy to see them because I think it's super important for
[2530.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** in order for us to reach the mainstream that we wanted want them to reach.
[2534.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. No. That's that's great.
[2537.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Taking it a little bit back to the beginning again,
[2541.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** what was, like, your guys' main challenges
[2544.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** and considerations
[2546.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** when it came to the the Mist Wallet and,
[2550.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** the early development of it, especially into relations to the fact that Ethereum was so early
[2557.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** and it was still evolving.
[2559.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** What do you guys you know, what do you think about that? What was your biggest,
[2562.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know,
[2564.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** maybe challenges and considerations
[2566.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** you took into place when you when building?
[2571.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Oh,
[2572.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think that
[2574.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think that is an interesting question that comes to the heart of what made it do the the the missed wallet,
[2581.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** why it was doomed and why it failed. Right? One of the things we really wanted was like, we sort of wanted to reinvent
[2589.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** the way the web would work.
[2592.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** We really wanted to make sure that
[2595.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** every user of the missed wallet was also a full load. Right? With one going to be a full node on Ethereum, it was also going to be,
[2605.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** a full node on Swarm, on every app there would be,
[2609.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, hosted on Swarm. We didn't even want it to have to be for you to be able to be able to connect
[2616.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** to,
[2617.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** to a, like, traditional web, which we call it. Right? We didn't even want you to be able to connect to a to a website. Right? The idea was that every app that you you have to you you you load,
[2629.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** if you load an ENS name, and that is going to connect to a form mode, and that is going to get you down download your your app
[2638.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** directly from other missed wallet users. Right? And, also,
[2643.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** you you'll be running a it's your own full node so that you're never depend on anything. Right?
[2649.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** I mean, we're very, like,
[2652.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** let's say, not very pragmatic about it because the reality was that,
[2657.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, it worked for a few years in 02/2015,
[2660.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** 2016.
[2662.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** It wasn't still possible for you to run a a full note in your desktop.
[2666.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** But the reality is that by 2017,
[2670.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** on one of the first really big major
[2673.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** full run started happening,
[2675.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** it really already take, like, hours and hours
[2679.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** for between downloading
[2680.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** and actually having the the wallet work.
[2683.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then
[2685.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** almost
[2686.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** and then, like, most people had already migrated by MetaMask, which MetaMask is just
[2693.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** instant. Right? You download it. You don't need to download the new browser. You already use the browser you like.
[2698.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** It connect it connect the connect directly to Etherscan, so you don't need to
[2704.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** worry about a full node.
[2706.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** We connect directly to the web, so you don't need to worry about
[2710.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** storing your, like, your web page or anything like that.
[2715.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** And in the end, that was,
[2717.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think, one of the main reason is that
[2719.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Lyft failed because we we were sort of, like,
[2722.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** dreaming too much in a way. Right? We wanted everyone to run a full road. I mean, like, we were ready. We wanted everyone to run a fully decentralized web, and that wasn't possible back then. And it's still not possible today.
[2736.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And that is sort of how the whole project and the factory ended up with no users.
[2741.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** We had to shut it down.
[2743.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** What are the main reasons?
[2745.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That's that was one of my questions towards the end. I was gonna ask why you guys actually decided to sunset,
[2752.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** but that that makes sense because, you know, it is hard to get people to interact on that level if it you know, you have to create a node and make sure the node is is running correctly and everything, like, that just kinda
[2766.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** steers some of the the less technical people away.
[2770.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** We we were able to abstract all of that there of that technical side of creating a note. Like, you didn't know you were creating a note. You I know. You didn't know you're creating anything like that. You're just uploading.
[2782.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** But the problem with trying to abstract a lot of things with design
[2786.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** is that
[2787.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** you can make a lot of things feel like magic, and that that's what
[2791.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** we wanted to do. But there's a point in which you you hit,
[2795.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** a technical roadblock.
[2798.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And for most users, that was when we would tell them, look, it's gonna take you five hours or six hours
[2805.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** or maybe a full week before you can even use this app. Right? And there there's no way to extract anything about that. Right? I I remember actually
[2816.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** spending hours and hours trying to work on the right mode animation
[2821.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** to make sure that that little bar
[2824.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** would feel that, like, it was loading faster than what it was actually loading.
[2829.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** But then, like,
[2831.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** there's no design that can save you when the amount of time it's going to actually take it's, like, a week. Mhmm. Right?
[2838.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** The the animation can look fancy and can have a lot of cool things, but it's gonna take a week. There's no
[2846.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** there's no way around that. Right? There's no putting deep stick on that field. Yeah. I think Mac was, talking about that earlier in the earlier space. Mac, you can come up and say something if if your mic sounds alright.
[2862.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Nope. Nope. Not gonna say anything. Okay. Sounds good. I'll go to my next question.
[2869.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** I got a question to ask. Oh, okay. Yeah. Go ahead, brother.
[2873.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.
[2874.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** How's everybody doing? Good. Good. Good. Glad to have you up here. Didn't know me as magician, but you guys could just call me Mud.
[2882.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** I have a question for Alex.
[2886.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** I was gonna ask you actually answered another question I
[2889.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** posted
[2890.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** in the Telegram,
[2892.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** which was,
[2894.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** what was your biggest concern,
[2897.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** as far as,
[2899.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** on the development side of, like, how to get or onboard the next billion users? And I think you kinda touched on it. You said account abstraction,
[2907.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** if I'm not mistaken.
[2910.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** Another question I wanted to ask was,
[2913.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** what's your biggest lesson that you've learned
[2915.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** on a personal level as far as
[2919.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** finding that balance in between,
[2922.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** doing the work, like putting your head down and just,
[2927.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** just enveloping yourself into your ideas and pushing them forward and working with the team? Like, how
[2935.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** what's your biggest lesson you've learned with, you know, trying to push forward an idea you believe in,
[2941.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** but also being receptive to other people's ideas and actually trying to find a way to,
[2947.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** make other people
[2948.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** see your vision?
[2952.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** That is a great question because I think
[2955.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** I've
[2956.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** that is an
[2958.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** you that is how we work with a team. Right?
[2961.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** I think the best work I've I've ever drawn
[2965.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** when I'm, like, I I've been working with remote teams for
[2969.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** over ten years. Right? We
[2972.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** way before, like, Zoom was a thing and and
[2976.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** and way before COVID was a thing. We we were
[2980.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** remote teams, not because we wanted, but rather because there was no other way to get people from all over the world to work in a single project if you have to fly everyone to the same place. Right?
[2994.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** And we we had to work remotely.
[2997.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Part of working
[2998.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** challenge of working remotely is that you have a lot of
[3002.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** time for you alone to be working,
[3005.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, focus without anyone
[3007.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** over your shoulder to check what you're doing. But then you need to have
[3013.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** full conversations with people. And those conversations,
[3018.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** it's it's not about you pushing your idea and then or or accepting
[3024.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** the idea of someone else and guessing who who wins.
[3027.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** But it's really about
[3030.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** trying to
[3031.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** trying to find a common place. Right? I think in those discussion, the ideas get the idea gets better. Often and often and often, the way it would work is I'd like I I sort of mentioned that, but I I think I think it's interesting to reiterate.
[3046.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** You would I would have an idea.
[3048.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** Fabian would have a different idea.
[3050.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And would fight over this idea that put on the argument.
[3055.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** Every time he would make an argument against my idea, I would come back and say, look. Yeah. But if you change this, then that solves that. And then he was, no. No. But if we change this other thing, my idea is better. But on those arguments, what we are doing was actually
[3071.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** hitting each other idea and modifying it to a point in which at some point in the middle,
[3077.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** we were like,
[3078.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** yeah. I think that works.
[3080.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** And
[3081.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** it I was almost as if we were hit beating each other's idea
[3087.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** until it felt in the middle,
[3089.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** which was, like, a much more strong
[3093.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** idea and something much
[3095.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** and that felt like you belong to both of us. Right? It never felt at any moment that I was giving up on something that I really believed on or that I was forcing him to give up on his idea. It felt like we were both
[3109.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** by debating it, we were both owning the thing,
[3113.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** and we were reaching something that was probably better than anything that we we both,
[3120.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** could think of. I think Steve Jobs uses the term, Mucci. I think it's fantastic. And you have to have
[3127.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** strong beliefs
[3128.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** loosely held.
[3130.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** Meaning that, like, you really should believe the things you you like, you you you must be very passionate about your own beliefs. But also,
[3139.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** be very
[3140.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** you should drop them very easily whenever you see something better come along.
[3146.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** Right?
[3148.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** It's interesting.
[3149.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** Thank you for the,
[3151.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** answer you gave. You actually answered a a few questions I had in mind. That I think that's very valuable information for anybody who's
[3159.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** attempting to,
[3162.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** promote or push forward an idea, but also trying to work in a team.
[3166.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** Thank
[3168.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** you. For sure. Yeah. And and think about that. And it's also important. Right? A lot of the work I did often
[3175.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** as as a designer
[3177.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** was that I was just trying to communicate
[3180.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** to the developers
[3182.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** the things I was seeing that users needed.
[3184.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** And
[3185.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** and sometimes, I was trying to communicate to final users
[3189.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** The thing that the developer wanted to build that couldn't
[3193.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** be understood,
[3194.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** so as a designer, I felt I was constantly translating from those words. Right? I was looking at something that developers want to build this thing. It's nobody understand what it is. I would translate it to, like, an end user. And then I would, like, advocate for the end user saying, hey. This is how we are gonna build
[3211.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** this thing for them. And I think being that portion in between is super important. And often,
[3217.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** what you do a lot is just
[3219.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** you're trying to communicate and having convincing people that this is a good thing worth building.
[3226.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That yeah. That that's I I appreciate that question, Mark, because even though,
[3231.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** it's a bit of a situation with me, but I'm dealing with the same thing when it comes to, you know, trying to find a healthy,
[3237.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** positive, collaborative environment
[3239.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** instead of, like, you know, being at each other's neck and trying to figure out who's right or what's the best way to go.
[3245.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Sometimes the collaborative, you know and there needs to be a a sense of positivity and realize that all the the end goal is the same for everybody. You know, how we get there is, you know, that's that's how you work together and figure out what's the best way to approach that problem. And, you know, it's tough to work with teams, especially
[3262.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** remote. You're not there to see, you know, people's reactions in person and judge body language. It's it's tough at times.
[3272.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. And you have to listen. Right? If if you like, if you feel that your ideas are pure
[3278.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** beauty and genius
[3280.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** and that everyone is trying to run it, you're probably not a very good,
[3285.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, team member, and probably your ideas aren't that great. Right? You have to have humility and then understand that everyone also had like, other people also have, like, good ideas on how to improve your thing.
[3297.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, and nowadays with this culture, I mean, some of these crypto Twitter people and stuff like that, like, there's a very there's a lot of arrogance that everybody thinks they know they know it all. And
[3309.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** if you can't
[3310.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** if you can't take a step back and see that you don't know it all and you never will know it all, you you know, you're better off as a team because you guys connect you know, you can actually take that receptive, you know, that criticism and take those other ideas and and mesh it into one like you're saying. And now it's not just one idea, it's everybody's idea and, you know, everybody put in the time or effort and now they, you know, all feel kinda, you know, emotionally or connected to that idea, you know.
[3336.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I know that that's that was a great question, Mud. Especially as I'm, you know, dealing with that stuff on my own building. It's it's really, it's really nice to hear something like that.
[3347.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** Can you hear me now about insurance? I think we have we have I think we have time for one last question. Okay. One last question.
[3355.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Can you hear me along? Yeah. Yeah. We could hear you.
[3359.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Do you wanna ask the final question? I was gonna try to
[3362.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. I'll be just quick.
[3366.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** So I think you mentioned, Alex, that there was a lot of attempts to do,
[3371.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** you know,
[3374.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** essentially on chain wallets and stuff. I know that the the ETHSwarm team was working quite early on,
[3380.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** like Daniel Meiji and some other guys like Ido Shaderin on on on chain wallet called eth log get login eth.
[3389.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** Have you were you familiar with that one? It wasn't that that early, but,
[3393.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** it was it was something that I that I also came across and did a little bit of work on probably two years ago. And second small question,
[3403.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** the parity wallet came out just after missed wallets. Was that in an in an attempt to solve the issue with the syncing of the whole mode? Because I remember that that one,
[3412.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** there was, you know, statements that they would try and run that on, like, a live client and only, you know, a sync portion of the of the of the chain.
[3423.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** So I work with Daniel Nagy, if that's the same person. He he went also on the forum. Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember his work on
[3431.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** on
[3432.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** on login. That's interesting.
[3434.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Not sure you not sure what you mean by up like, on chain wallets.
[3440.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** The parity
[3441.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** lite client thing, I like, since I was working
[3444.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** with with you and they they were always, like, claims that, like, yeah, this light client sync or this, like,
[3452.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** this new light client sync is going to be the one that solves
[3455.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** all light client's problem. Right? So there's oh, it's and and there's
[3461.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** and, like, I
[3463.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** I we tried a lot of them, and I think
[3466.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** I still don't think there's,
[3471.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** and I think and I still don't think there's a very good way to really have a fully decentralized light client,
[3478.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** that
[3479.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** that can just connect to it. Right?
[3482.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** First of all,
[3487.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** first of all, because it's it's hard to do it.
[3489.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** Often
[3490.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** and that's just even sadder is that often the user doesn't really care. That's also a big problem. Always,
[3497.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** often, the user like, if you say, look, it's instead of taking, like, one gigabyte or 10 gigabyte, this thing is gonna stick a 100 megabytes.
[3506.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** And the user is like, why do I even wanna, like, use this 200 megabytes if I can just connect to Etherscan or, like, whatever?
[3515.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** And then
[3516.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** that's that's never good enough for a user.
[3521.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Tough.
[3523.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** So, yeah, user the user didn't care is
[3526.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** an epitaph for a thousand
[3529.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** decentralized projects everywhere.
[3532.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** Awesome. Thank you for answering that. I tagged you in the comment with the repo that I was talking about. And, yes, it was Daniel Najee from Ed Swan. I
[3539.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** I I did a bit of work with him two years ago.
[3543.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Alex, I got one question for you just so you have time to plug here what you're working on. I saw that you're working on a new project called the high order company.
[3553.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, you know, what the goals is, and just, you know, talk about what you're currently working on? And after that, I just, you know, appreciate your time and stuff.
[3563.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Sure.
[3564.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** I am working
[3566.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** both in two fronts. I am working a lot of ENS
[3569.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** on on meta governance for ENS and for
[3572.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** DAOs in general. Right? I think it's super important to think about governance, and I still think that one of the main impact that blockchain can do today
[3580.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** is to to have,
[3583.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** decentralized
[3584.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** companies or organizations
[3585.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** where all the funds are trackable and everything is transparent. And I'm very proud to see that ENS is, I I would say, one of the best example of that.
[3595.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** The second thing I I work a lot I've been working on
[3599.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** is I'm
[3602.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** I'm one of the smartest people I've worked with
[3606.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** during my time in the JVM Foundation, I'm not saying a lot because I did work with a lot of more people, was, a guy named Victor
[3613.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** Victor
[3614.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** Tylen.
[3616.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** Victor Maya then, he goes by Victor Tylen right now. And he he worked on the missed wallet, and he was like, I I would often ask him to do a task. Hey. Can you just integrate this library with with Swarm for a bit? And he was like, two three days later, he was, yeah. The work is done, but I I need some more time because I found an upstream bug on the library. And then three days later, he was, yeah, I fixed the I I fixed the library,
[3641.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** but I think the library is having a
[3643.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** the wrong approach. Give me a few days. I'm gonna make a new library for that. And then I I gave him a few days more, and he was like, you know, I've created a new library, but I think the problem real real problem that Lyft is using the wrong thing. We should, like, re really refactor Lyft as a whole to do the thing. And at some point, I I joked him. Look, Victor, I can't give you more time. I know that if you just have all the time in the world, we would just want to build the whole a fucking new computer. And he was like, yeah. You're right. I will. Well, guess what? Victor has all the time in the world now. He's he's actually building a new computer,
[3680.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** and he just figured out a way to
[3683.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** like, he he he's been studying, like, computer science, like, history,
[3688.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** and he found a way
[3690.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** that to create
[3691.6s] **SPEAKER_02:** a view of the computers are much more parallel,
[3695.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** can execute faster, a lot of things like that. And I think it is fantastic.
[3701.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** And it's even and it's it's one of those things that is very hard to to
[3706.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** to communicate what they are doing,
[3709.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** but I think they are doing something that is going to be big,
[3712.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** which is why I like working with them because part of what I work there is just trying to explain people what they're doing. Right? And I think
[3722.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** and we we are working on a new website. It's gonna be very cool. You're gonna have to have very see be able to see them some animations.
[3729.0s] **SPEAKER_02:** But in
[3730.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** essence, kinda like, we are
[3733.4s] **SPEAKER_02:** we are all using Turing machine. And he's like, look. Turing machines are wrong. There are better ways to do it. Instead of having this, like, concept of a Turing machine, which is like a little robot with infinite tapes that goes back and forth and changes the tapes from zero to one. He's able to turn any sort of computation
[3752.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** in basically a a like a planar graph with a thousand lines, and those lines
[3759.8s] **SPEAKER_02:** have, like, four little commands that they can do,
[3763.1s] **SPEAKER_02:** and they can do it all at the same time. So you can do it you can run it in eight sixteen cores at the same time, and it just becomes a very easy way to transform
[3773.3s] **SPEAKER_02:** any computation, something that is multi core all the time. So, yeah, you should if you think this sounds interesting, you should definitely follow the HVM,
[3783.7s] **SPEAKER_02:** page.
[3784.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** How do I profit off this? Maybe How do I invest in this?
[3789.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** Well, you should follow us.
[3792.9s] **SPEAKER_02:** If you wanna be
[3795.5s] **SPEAKER_02:** a a pioneer yourself, maybe you can participate on that somehow.
[3799.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Right? I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would.
[3804.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Is is that the high order company, or is that something else?
[3808.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That's I'm definitely gonna, check that out and do some research because that that sounds amazing. And it sounds like the guy you got on board is definitely
[3816.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** one of those, those genius pioneers that you don't come across very often. So
[3822.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. You should definitely follow. But,
[3824.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** yeah, I'm gonna look into that. I I wholeheartedly really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here.
[3830.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Maybe we could do it again sometimes because I still have, like, 20 other questions I wanna ask you. But, and I know there's other people here too that wanted to come up, but it's been about an hour, and, you know, I don't wanna take too much of your time. So thank you so much,
[3844.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** and I I really I really true do truly do appreciate it.
[3849.2s] **SPEAKER_02:** Well, thank you for the invitation, and it was fun to have this conversation. Yeah, man.
[3853.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** Have a good day. If anybody will meet I will probably stay on for a little bit and chat it up. So,
[3859.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** you're more than like them like, you know, welcome to go, head out and do whatever you gotta do, and thanks, man.
[3866.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Okay. Thank you, everyone. Have a good one. Bye.
[3872.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. That's great. That was great. How much longer are you gonna stay on?
[3877.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** I I I don't know. I was just kinda letting him dip out to see what everybody thought. I thought that was really super super, you know, intense, informative.
[3885.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. You really held it down. Good job.
[3888.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** I mean, I had a whole list of stuff I wanted to make sure I asked them, and I only got through, like, half of it. I would have been on here for another hour. But I appreciate that. Nonetheless.
[3898.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. No. Yeah. That was it was really good. I wanna do this every Monday.
[3903.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** So,
[3904.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** yeah, I'm in in the chat as
[3907.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** a ascension guide. So if I was thinking about making a little bit of,
[3912.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** like a Telegram group. So if anybody wants to,
[3916.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, shoot me a PM, my PMs are open, you know, which is not the smartest thing to do, but my PMs are open. So shoot me a PM,
[3924.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** like, I could get, you know, whoever wants to, you know, jump on here and or, you know, maybe have some topics that they have and and they want for the next miss Monday. Like, I wanna do this every Monday. I wanna start building the community
[3938.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** to get to a point where, you know, we're having people actually
[3942.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** engage
[3943.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** rather than just, you
[3945.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** know, waiting for a number go up, which is great and stuff. And I love Mist,
[3950.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** but I think there's a lot of opportunity here when it comes to community building
[3954.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** or even just, you know, building in general. Like, this is one of the the older this is the oldest
[3960.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** ERC 20,
[3962.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** the first ERC 20
[3964.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** in, you know, all of Ethereum. There's a lot of cool things that we could do with this. We just need to, you know,
[3971.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** make that community a bit,
[3972.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, tight tight knitted and have a little bit more than just financial incentive, which I all know we're here to watch the number go up. But Number go up, bro.
[3982.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. That's it. Number go up. But it's actually fun, man. It's fun developing.
[3987.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** I was you know, me and and Victor who,
[3991.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** leads the Discord and and runs the, social media.
[3995.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** We were here since October, and we kinda pushed to get
[4000.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** missed, like, you know, the liquidity sufficient enough to start getting people to be able to buy and and take part. And it's been a crazy journey, man, about a lot of ups and downs. Yo. About that Cue. About that. I don't mean to cut you off, but you you No. You're clear. About the liquidity.
[4016.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** So I saw that
[4017.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** this is on base now,
[4019.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** which is amazing. I think that's a great opportunity
[4022.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** for users to get,
[4025.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** some exposure.
[4028.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** Is is it bridged, or is it just the
[4031.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** I think there's, like Is it properly bridged? More It's bridged, but the liquidity is very, very small because
[4037.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** a lot of people haven't really bridged over. So what we were planning to do is what
[4043.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** I was gonna talk to to,
[4045.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Alex about, but we didn't get enough time is there was actually
[4049.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** a a Doge
[4051.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** ETH bridge
[4052.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** that,
[4053.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum was planning back in, like, 2017,
[4056.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** and there was 50,000
[4058.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** missed valued at about a million dollars
[4061.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** that were sent to this Doge kind of bounty because it was a bounty. So So it was like, whoever can make a bridge between
[4069.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** Doge
[4069.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** and ETH, do you have a bounty? And it was like a shit ton of ETH. And the mist was kinda just thrown in there as, I don't know, a joke
[4077.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** or something. I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask him about. I was like, who kinda thought about sending that. So,
[4084.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** there's actually
[4086.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** some crazy signers on there, like Alex,
[4090.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** I don't know. I think Fabian,
[4091.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** but Vitalik is on there as a signer.
[4094.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** Like, there's a lot of big names on there as signers. If we could somehow
[4099.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** get
[4100.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** the attention of enough signers to
[4103.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** go ahead and unlock that 50
[4106.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** that 50 k missed coin, we could have
[4108.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** okay. Here's Victor. Hold on one second.
[4111.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** We could,
[4112.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** have potentially
[4114.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** enough to bridge over the base, maybe do a little bit of, like, a DAO incentive things because there is a DAO for Mist coin that I set up, via snapshot,
[4123.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** and then go ahead and maybe pay out some developers for building cool things on top of Mist. Like, that 50 k would be very, very valuable if we could somehow
[4133.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** snatch it up. But,
[4135.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** what's going on, Victor? Oh, yeah. My bad.
[4137.5s] **SPEAKER_05:** No. You're good. Yes. Asen, first of all, congratulation for this initiative. I think that's great. Please keep it up because I think that this most Monday
[4146.0s] **SPEAKER_05:** miss Monday is something that we we need to keep. And secondly, about the liquidity in base, just remember guys that Uniswap
[4152.8s] **SPEAKER_05:** pools are permissionless. No? So everybody's free to to pull their own liquidity. And at the end of the day, I mean, if everybody,
[4161.3s] **SPEAKER_05:** let's say, pulls, like, a 10% of their holdings of missed or five percent or just a tiny tiny amount, At the end, the liquidity there will be more healthy, and we will progressively be
[4173.0s] **SPEAKER_05:** building more liquidity
[4174.4s] **SPEAKER_05:** in base. You know? I mean,
[4176.2s] **SPEAKER_05:** maybe now we don't have too much volume there because the liquidity is tiny, so nobody would be interested in trading there or no. But it's something like
[4183.4s] **SPEAKER_05:** progressively. No? The more
[4185.3s] **SPEAKER_05:** people pulling liquidity there, the more volume we will have there and think
[4190.3s] **SPEAKER_05:** that we will have more exposure there eventually. So I think that maybe waiting for releasing these tokens of DogeDAO,
[4197.5s] **SPEAKER_05:** maybe it will take time. So maybe we can do this coming the effort of providing some liquidity by ourselves.
[4204.2s] **SPEAKER_05:** You know that well, you know, the gas fees now in the main net are very low. So, well, I think that everybody can afford to do a swap in main net because, well,
[4212.1s] **SPEAKER_05:** the the the way this morning, I guess, was in seven, six points or something like that. So
[4217.8s] **SPEAKER_05:** it's not too too expensive.
[4220.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** Do you know who created the the base side,
[4223.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** the base side Mistcoin,
[4225.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** essentially the the bridge?
[4227.9s] **SPEAKER_05:** Yeah. It's me. But, well, there is a tool in base called base migrate. So everybody is free to do to do that. It's very simple. It's just two or three steps, and you have, like, a tutorial developed by the base guy. So everybody is free to do the same in with any a certain minute token.
[4245.1s] **SPEAKER_05:** It just takes, like,
[4247.1s] **SPEAKER_05:** thirty minutes to the whole process and later on, like, five, six days to have the pull request in GitHub approved.
[4254.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. Yeah. I I actually was speaking about the on the earlier
[4258.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** on the earlier,
[4261.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** space, I was saying how base is really, really popping off and how l twos have made it really, really easy for for,
[4268.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** I mean,
[4270.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** lots of different use cases.
[4273.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** But surely, you we don't need liquidity
[4277.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** for we only need liquidity of Mist tokens if they want to bridge
[4283.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** back from,
[4284.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** base to Ethereum. Right? Because if you want to it it well, it depends on how the bridge is set up. But if you're if you're bridging from Ethereum mainnet to base, you essentially
[4295.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** are are minting a new token on the base side. And,
[4298.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** in that way, you could basically
[4300.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** it's
[4301.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** it's ready for you. So anybody who wants to bridge from
[4305.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** Ethereum just bridges it, admits the new token on base. But, obviously, bridging it back from from base
[4312.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** to to to Ethereum would require more liquidity.
[4318.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I think it locks up it it locks up that mist, and that's why it's only one specific bridge. I don't think there's multiple bridges. So if you lock your mist in that contract, it mince the, the base token, and then you put that base back in there and it unlocks the, mist that, you know, whatever amount it was and stuff like that. So that yeah.
[4338.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** They come the supply can only be as high as how many people locked up in that, initial ETH bridge. Yeah. So the liquidity is just that you you we want liquidity just in case we wanna bridge back from base. So anybody who has missed, we don't you can just go ahead and and bridge across.
[4355.0s] **SPEAKER_05:** Yes. Yeah. I I was I was referring
[4357.1s] **SPEAKER_05:** just to the liquid liquidity in Uniswap just in case you want to do some swaps from a third unit base to to misting base. Just that as,
[4365.1s] **SPEAKER_05:** as I was saying, I mean, you don't need the liquidity in both sides to make the bridge the bridge work in such a way that once you you bridge one token from minute to to the base side, I mean, it's, like, frozen. It's, like, locked.
[4376.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we need more liquidity providers
[4380.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** is is what you're saying. I have a I have a suggestion. Right?
[4383.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** Uh-huh. What does everybody think about
[4386.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** maybe
[4388.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** because, you know, there's, like, meme
[4390.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** mania right now,
[4393.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** and people are throwing their money at all types of
[4396.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** I mean, pretty much bullshit.
[4398.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** Right? Mhmm. And this narrative that we're looking at right now, we're dealing with this pretty much like
[4404.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** I mean, it it sells itself. I'm just speaking from an investor
[4407.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** standpoint. Right? So if liquidity is the goal,
[4412.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** what does everybody think about
[4414.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** maybe
[4416.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** us ourselves instead of waiting for the, like, the Doge,
[4421.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** unlocking that 50 k, that that that'll be good.
[4425.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** But instead of, like, waiting
[4427.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** or while while we wait on that,
[4429.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** I mean, something that we could maybe possibly do if everybody's up for it, maybe we could start,
[4434.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** I don't know, maybe
[4436.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** our own our own token or something,
[4439.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** deploy it.
[4440.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** Some of us add some liquidity to that, get it up off the ground.
[4444.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** But X Token has the sole
[4447.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** and explicit purpose of,
[4450.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** I don't know, maybe bringing more attention to Mist itself
[4455.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** and the Relic Meta itself
[4458.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** and maybe, I don't know, a portion of,
[4464.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** fees generated or,
[4466.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** money made,
[4468.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** can go towards
[4470.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** explicitly
[4471.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** to
[4473.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** providing liquidity Mhmm.
[4475.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** To the pool. Yeah. It's I mean, it's interesting. I mean, in
[4480.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** I think a lot of You know, just something because, you know, it we can we can take advantage of
[4486.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** the fact that there's so many people, especially on this new chain because, like, base that are just buying whatever the, like, whatever the hell.
[4494.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** This is actually I don't I I mean, just I don't know the the how the mechanics would work, but essentially, that's how, like, the the experience would go. Like, we're all in on it. We know what's up. We're already
[4505.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** doing what we can. I see a few of us are already, like, you know, reposting stuff and posting memes and doing what we can to, like, you know, get it out there and get attention and market it. And that's, like, amazing.
[4515.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** But just an idea, you know, of just so we can get some, like, new money in and we can actually use that for something. And as a community, we all agree. You Know what I mean? Mhmm. Full transparency. No wrong bullshit.
[4527.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** I don't know. Just something think it's maybe it sounds gimmicky, but
[4531.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** I don't know. Sometimes gimmicks work and,
[4534.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** you know, people always wanna put their money in things. So I that that's just where my head was at. I would I would just caution against creating a new token willy nilly because, you know,
[4543.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** a lot of people forget.
[4545.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** There's a lot of legal things that come into it. You you know? So, like, you Legal? It's you could kinda say you're you're you're just splintering liquidity. Yes. No. No. No. Not just that. It's regulation. Right? So if if
[4557.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** you you know, to launch a to launch a token, like, the proper way, you have to make sure that, like, you,
[4563.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** you know,
[4564.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** understand the the legalities in different jurisdictions,
[4569.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** because
[4570.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** and a lot of people just don't do this because they're like, whatever. You know? But, you know,
[4575.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** it can really come bite your bite your back in the ass if, you know, like, hey. You launched a token,
[4580.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** and then, you know,
[4582.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** the SEC comes knocking or, you know and and remember, you're opening up yourself up to
[4588.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** every single jurisdiction because it's blockchain unless you actually say you can't trade this token in these jurisdictions.
[4595.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** Like, you know, in certain platforms, you can't. As an American, you can't use it. I I I see where you're going with it. I see where you're going. And that's definitely something that would be at the forefront of the legality of it because, you know, nobody really has time to deal with,
[4609.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** that.
[4610.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** What I was thinking Not doing properly, I should say. If we could. I mean, I kinda am starting this with, like, my Blockchain Historical Society and stuff is
[4619.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** trying to get our hands on old
[4622.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** relics
[4623.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** and then potentially
[4625.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** using those as, like, a reward system
[4628.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** for supplying liquidity or something like that. Like, there's a lot of different ways we can go about it and still kinda
[4635.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** not launch our own token,
[4637.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** but find a way to reward those that add liquidity
[4640.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** or there's a lot of different ways about things, and I've actually reached out to some people,
[4648.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** and got a hold of via just
[4651.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** really digging into the blockchain and of some old developers that were launching tokens and stuff like that. So It could be NFT.
[4659.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** It could it could be a lot of different things for, my buddy of mine.
[4664.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** His name's like t
[4666.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** scurver or something like that,
[4668.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** on on Twitter. And he he wrapped,
[4672.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** a bunch of x copy
[4673.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** NFTs into ERC 20 tokens, and
[4677.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** they're pretty, yeah, they're pretty big. He's a he's I mean, his last time I checked, his the market cap was, like, you know, anywhere between, like, 5 to 10 mil.
[4687.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** And it's just he just wrapped old
[4689.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** or not old, but art from x copy in it. And just because x copy is like a historical artist that has a big following, like, it makes it easier to trade it rather than, like, an NFT and stuff. So
[4702.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** A fractional?
[4702.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** Like, somebody could get a no amount of that? Yeah. They could. I I think, yeah, I think you can as well. But they're like It's something that I feel like people in the community would really bite and go for just because it has to do with, like, mist. So
[4716.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** the legality thing, of like a actual token,
[4720.0s] **SPEAKER_04:** I agree with that. But something just anything that could,
[4724.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** something that could, like, people who are already invested in this
[4728.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** can feel like, you know, they're a part of something or they they had got exclusive access to something because they're a holder. Right. You know what I mean? Which starts there. And then from there, we build out
[4742.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. No. I
[4743.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** more more liquidity. Attention and liquidity. Education.
[4746.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Well, I think a good way to be able to rep that you own Mist
[4751.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** could be smart, whether it be a PFP or something like that. Like, you know how you guys were talking about those badges earlier?
[4757.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Those back in the day badges.
[4759.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** Same thing with, like,
[4761.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** the dude from Bankless, like, high like, with the with the Pope,
[4765.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** you know, the POAP.
[4766.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Things like that. Sim you know what I'm saying? Like, something similar
[4772.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** to that.
[4774.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** And that could have a whole bunch of that could open up a whole bunch of other,
[4778.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** you know, doors to that could lead back to the thing you were talking about of the,
[4783.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** dao or society about the relics and, you know, collecting
[4786.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** and stuff like that. Uh-huh.
[4789.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** Leads back to one another.
[4791.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I think there's a huge,
[4793.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** huge market for this,
[4795.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** these relics and stuff. And I'm, like, you know, I'm not gonna go through and shill any relics or anything like that.
[4801.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** But there's a huge you know, like, with any market, you know, like, even like video games and stuff, like, people are paying
[4809.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** top dollar for the old early video games, you know, the ones that came out, some of the first ones.
[4816.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Like, you have you have some of those in in mint condition, you know. People are spending tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for some of those things. You know, why does why is crypto any different? Especially, it's a in the fact of crypto is, like, one year in crypto is, like, ten years, you know. Like, it that's how fast it it kinda moves.
[4836.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** So, like, I really see a huge opportunity in these early
[4840.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** tokens, these early NFTs.
[4844.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** I think like a PFP or something, which is something that I was I was kinda working on
[4849.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** for Mist,
[4850.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** or another token that I was gonna move over to Mist.
[4855.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** The only thing is I kinda wanted to, like, do it for free, you know, or you locked up
[4860.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** x amount of Mist and you got your toke you got an NFT. If you didn't want your NFT anymore, you burned it and you got your mist back.
[4869.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** But
[4870.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** it could be we could do a certain percentage or fee just to build up,
[4876.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** a little bit of whether it be a treasury or some liquidity to move over the base because,
[4883.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** seeding base liquidity would be
[4887.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** really, really great. Just That was my point. Yeah. We need we should do That that was, like, the crux of what I was getting at, really. It just needs to be tasteful because you don't wanna dilute
[4897.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** Of course. What we have here. Like, the like, whether
[4901.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Mist has liquidity on base or not, like, I'm in my opinion, this is not financial advice, It doesn't matter. At some point, Mist is gonna come across the right eyes, and this thing is gonna blow the fuck up. Now
[4914.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** it would it be nice to have, you know, nice liquidity on two chains just to give other people options, you know, ETH will be at some point
[4922.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** It is hot right now. On on you know, unusable. You know, at some point, it will not unusable, but very expensive to use on, and that will drive a lot of people away.
[4932.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** So it would be nice to get, you know, another chain functional with, you know, cheaper gas.
[4938.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** People like these. People love it.
[4941.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. No. Base is I have some questions about base on, you know, some things they said, like,
[4946.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, if something did go down, I think they would bend the knee to the SEC, and if you don't fucking give up your information, you won't be able to bridge out or something like that. It's always a possibility.
[4957.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I see them handing out Wells notices and stuff. Like, I've been seeing that. I don't even know what that is, but it's probably like The Wells notice? Yeah.
[4965.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** Oh, it's just pretty much like,
[4968.5s] **SPEAKER_04:** in layman's terms, it's kinda like a, a forewarning
[4971.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** of
[4973.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** or like a chance. That's like that's like what the SCC gives companies, like, hey. Just just a heads up.
[4979.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** We figure you're doing something that falls out of bounds of the law. Yeah. And,
[4984.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** this is your chance. So this is your, like,
[4987.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** acknowledgement. This is your chance to
[4989.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** realize we're on you pretty much or, like, something's coming. What is it? There there is a
[4995.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** it's not an official charge. It's just kinda like a a notice. Yeah. They're essentially saying they're saying that, you know, we are coming we are going to take you to court for x and x for x and y, and you should start
[5008.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** preparing your your defense. Right? Prepare yourself. Yeah. So
[5013.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** it's intent it it intent to prosecute. I've seen it with Robinhood. I've seen it with some other exchanges. So what you just said about base, yes, that is also something that we should think about,
[5023.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** you know,
[5025.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** focusing in too much of our eggs in that base basket. I just figured base because only because of the popularity, but, yes, that is also a concern that I think about as well. I mean, base Base The US.
[5036.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** Base is pretty safe, purely because it is Coinbase, and Coinbase has actually,
[5041.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** gone through the rigmarole,
[5043.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** with the SEC. I think that it's
[5046.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** it could be there could be more right now, but it's like Coinbase is, like, the only one that's,
[5051.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** is is, like, backed. Like, it's it's fair
[5055.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** fair that it's insured, essentially.
[5058.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** So they went through that whole process, which is which is good.
[5063.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** But
[5064.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** yeah, I mean, if you didn't know, Joe Joe Lubin from Consensus is actually taking the SEC to court because of all this all these Wells notices to to different companies like like Uniswap. See that. Yeah. It's great.
[5077.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** What's wrong? Gary didn't get, you know, didn't get the job at Binance, so now he's all salty and just so throwing notices at everybody.
[5086.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** Fucking, I can't I have no
[5089.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** idea. They're going off to MetaMask. They're going they they they're going back on
[5094.1s] **SPEAKER_04:** All the wallets. They they it's like they're trying to just it's like operation choke point. We're still in it. Yeah. They're basically they're basically trying to now say, hey.
[5104.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** You know, it is a security even though they've
[5107.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** gone through
[5108.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** like, the the same people who are saying that it's not a security have actually, like,
[5113.6s] **SPEAKER_03:** you know, stated that it is
[5116.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** a a, what do you call it, commodity
[5118.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** in the past. They're trying to say that MetaMask and other wallets are,
[5122.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** broker broker,
[5124.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** what's it called? A
[5125.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** a broker Broker dealer. Broker dealers, yeah, which is absolutely
[5129.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** insane. They're kind of just the terminology for broker dealer is just,
[5134.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** not good enough. It's crazy. Yeah. It it they they I think everybody should go look that up right now. Yeah. Yeah. They're basically hanging off the the definition of facilitation.
[5143.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** So, like,
[5144.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** they're saying, oh, but it facilitates.
[5147.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** You know? But the fact is it's a piece of it's a it's a it's an application,
[5152.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** and it can't it can't,
[5154.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** like, execute without
[5156.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** you pushing a button.
[5158.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** So in the same sense that they're calling it's a facilitator, you can say that, oh, okay. Cool. Well,
[5164.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** Apple and
[5165.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** and and Windows and, you know, Microsoft
[5168.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** should also be in this in this,
[5172.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** what do you call it, court case because they're also facilitating
[5175.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** these things. They're facilitating
[5177.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** in the same way that MetaMask is. Yeah. I wouldn't worry about I wouldn't worry about, like, you know, regulations
[5183.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** for
[5185.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** a token like a bridge token because
[5189.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** the the onus is that you're bridging the the the origin is the mist, and none of us here are the creator of mist. So and that would basically just be like opening up
[5202.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** making a case against a token
[5205.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** that has already gone through the rigmarole. So, you know, I don't think we worry about bridge tokens. Been a wild precedent. Yeah. Yeah. I see where you're going.
[5213.1s] **SPEAKER_03:** Every single bridge token would also need to then doubly
[5217.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** kind of, like, prove itself, which is which is ridiculous.
[5221.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** But
[5222.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** I like the idea of,
[5224.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** of an extra kind of,
[5227.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** like, it's almost like a marketing campaign, like a onboarding campaign. There's
[5231.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** I'm gonna also think about it and chat to you, AC, about I think we have the power to do it with with the amount of people that are already
[5238.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** interested in Mist,
[5241.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** Because of the just, like, the whole relic
[5244.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** meta thing, like,
[5246.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** it's not just about price go up. Like, I think the biggest thing that attracted me to it was just not the marketability
[5253.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** of Mist itself
[5255.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** due to the the the provenance and the history
[5257.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** and the associations. But
[5260.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** how
[5261.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** I'm literally in real time seeing
[5264.3s] **SPEAKER_04:** OGs, like, eat OGs, like, you know, kinda, like, double back. Like, because
[5270.7s] **SPEAKER_04:** it's like it's kind of like it's like a callback to, like, original
[5275.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** the community,
[5276.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** you know, before
[5278.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** before
[5279.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** the 2021
[5280.8s] **SPEAKER_04:** blow off top, before
[5282.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** meme coin mania, before Solana, before all that shit. Like, the OG feel, like, how it was back in the day. Like, people have something that they can actually call back to. Literally, it's what it's called a callback, like, in in in in writing or if if anybody
[5298.4s] **SPEAKER_04:** writes screenplays or anything like that or has anything to do with entertainment, a callback is kinda like or like in a joke, a callback is like, you know, you're literally referring back to
[5308.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** something else that was said. I feel like Myst is kinda like a callback to a time. You know what I mean? Like a vibe Mhmm. On Ethereum that people can actually see. Plus, the timestamp thing is super, super, super smart. I don't know who came up with that,
[5322.9s] **SPEAKER_04:** but that's really good. That's that's that's really good. Mhmm. Even even,
[5327.6s] **SPEAKER_04:** even It embodies what I'm what I'm trying to get across.
[5331.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Even Alex said that. And Alex is like Alex is like
[5335.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** like, I'm not footing or anything like that, but Alex is like he's still kinda, like,
[5339.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** just blown back at what Mist has become. He did not expect it
[5344.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** to get to this point, which is fine. You know? He he was just building, and he ended up building something great. Trying to give him the flowers, bro, and he was like, nah.
[5353.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** No. He's he's just a he's what he is. He's just like a He's humble. He's humble. He's just a builder. Yeah. He's a he's a good good guy. I've I've had a couple, like,
[5360.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** conversations with him outside of the,
[5363.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** the space, but he just, yeah, he he he wants to build and make good things. And,
[5368.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** the the you the whole unicorn like, that's one token I will talk about because he brought it up. The unicorn token is super cool. Really, really super cool, but it's, like, impossible to get your hands on. Like, that would be potentially something that would be really, really cool to give,
[5383.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** as, like, a reward or something if you, like, locked up some mist,
[5388.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** but it's, like, impossible.
[5390.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** They're, like, so
[5392.2s] **SPEAKER_04:** I like where you're going with that, though. Like, stuff like that. You know? Yeah. I think that falls in the line. And then, also, it kind of
[5399.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** gives us a bit of leeway when it comes to litigation because we didn't start these tokens. We're just
[5405.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** giving them out. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, we didn't
[5408.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** actually,
[5410.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, launch these tokens.
[5412.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** So if we were able to get our hands on some of them and just, like, give them out for free, not even necessarily, like, set a value behind it or anything or, you know, even make a liquidity pool, it's still, like, you're getting these old,
[5425.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, relic tokens.
[5426.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** You know? At some at some point, somebody would probably make a pool and do a whole bunch of stuff and start an initiative and grow a community just like we did with Mist.
[5435.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** You know? Like, that's what's fucking great about this is, like, anybody could step up and do anything for whatever token it may be, whether it be our actual token that's a relic or something that was innovative of the time. Maybe it's not 2017.
[5448.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Maybe it's not 2018 or, you know, maybe it's 2019. Maybe it's 2020. Like, that's still, like, you know,
[5455.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, four or five years ago. Like, the the space was much different then than it is now. I mean, look at Uniswap came around in 2020,
[5463.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** and that was one of the, you know, probably one of the greatest
[5467.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** crypto related tech advancements
[5469.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** of our time. The fact that liquidity pools could be made and anybody could trade any token and doesn't really need much liquidity behind it. Like, that was, you know, huge. And that was just created in 2020. If you really think about it, like, we are still so early in the tech development, you know, in the days of the, you know, the tech development, how far that we can go. You know, at some point, like, with account abstraction,
[5494.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** you're gonna get to a point where you're not even you're using crypto, and you're not even using it, and you don't even know you're using it. You know? It's like and that's when we're gonna see the normies,
[5503.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, normal people start to get involved, and they're not even gonna know that they're using crypto. But on the back end,
[5509.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** they are, and then that's when you're gonna see the explosion. That's when you're still gonna see Bitcoin hitting half a million, a million dollars because the adoption is there. You know? I mean Is this turning into now?
[5521.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** There was there was Bancorp and Zero x protocol in 2017.
[5525.0s] **SPEAKER_03:** So, I mean, there were on chain, you know,
[5529.3s] **SPEAKER_03:** swapping,
[5530.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** facilities for a long time. But Uniswap just Don't don't don't fraud me, dude. No. No. No. No. No. I'm I'm I'm not I'm I'm what I'm saying is that Uniswap just Uniswap just did it really, really well. You know what I mean? They they really did a a great job, and one thing that they did was,
[5545.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** they they had their their code open source. They also what do you call it?
[5551.4s] **SPEAKER_03:** They,
[5552.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** they they iterated really, really quickly with v two.
[5557.2s] **SPEAKER_03:** They, you know,
[5558.7s] **SPEAKER_03:** they they really did
[5560.8s] **SPEAKER_03:** do they did something that that was quite different.
[5564.2s] **SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. They they innovated. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.
[5567.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I'm I'm excited about Uniswap v four too with the whole hooks thing and everything. Like, I was thinking about, you know, how to build on top of the hooks. I'm not a developer. I just kinda think of things in development ways and try to, you know, figure out a way to make cool stuff. But
[5582.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Uniswap,
[5583.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** they did their thing for sure, and, yeah, they definitely changed the game.
[5587.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Zero x had liquidity pools like that? I thought they just had, like, straight up dexes.
[5593.5s] **SPEAKER_03:** Bank One, Zero x.
[5596.9s] **SPEAKER_03:** They I think in the early days, I think Zero x did have.
[5602.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** I don't know, dude. I think Uniswap made that LP. I think Uniswap came up with the LP idea. Yeah. You might be right. But Because I remember trading on, like, DX, which was they use XRX. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. And,
[5616.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** that was, like, 2019.
[5618.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** That was, like, when all the fucking burn tokens came out, which I think there's actually, you know, potentially some opportunity there and stuff, some deflationary tokens, you know, with this whole inflationary shit going on.
[5630.5s] **SPEAKER_01:** But yeah. No. It's it's been a it's been a crazy past I've been on, like, I've been in the game for, like, eight eight, nine years, so
[5638.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** it's crazy to see how far it's came. But,
[5642.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** I think that if anybody is interested and and wants to make a a Telegram
[5647.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** group, just please message
[5649.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** me, on Telegram at Ascension Guide. I'm I'm in the I'm in the chat, you know, all the time and and post and stuff. So just please shoot me a PM, and I'll make,
[5660.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** a miss Monday's
[5661.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** private telegram
[5663.0s] **SPEAKER_01:** where we could talk about, you know, potentially
[5667.1s] **SPEAKER_01:** topics or maybe special guests or what we could do. And, you know, I really think that this miss Mondays could be built up to a really you know, to have a lot of a lot of listeners in the futures and
[5679.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** especially the way as as Mist Coin grows and and gets more people in front of it. Like, this is this this is the space to come and talk and shoot the shit,
[5687.9s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, potentially bring on other partners or whatever it may be and, you know, just continue to grow this Relic space because the the more that the Relic space grows,
[5697.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** you know, the bigger opportunity it is for Myst.
[5702.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** So I'm probably gonna wrap it up there, guys.
[5705.4s] **SPEAKER_01:** Anybody that, you know, wants to shoot me a PM, you're more than welcome. I appreciate everybody jumping on. I think Alex had a lot of great things to say.
[5714.7s] **SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I I'm excited for the future.
[5722.2s] **SPEAKER_01:** Appreciate you, man. Thank you, Summer. Yeah. For sure. I'll see you guys potentially next Monday.
[5728.8s] **SPEAKER_01:** I wanna do this every Monday, but at the very least, like, every couple Mondays.
[5732.6s] **SPEAKER_01:** So I'll keep everybody posted in the chat and,
[5736.3s] **SPEAKER_01:** the missed Telegram, and, yeah, we'll, we'll talk there. Thanks, everybody.
