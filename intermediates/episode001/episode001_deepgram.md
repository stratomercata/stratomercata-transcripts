**SPEAKER_00:**
[0.0s] Alrighty.
[1.0s] So we're on.
[3.9s] Thanks.
[5.1s] So
[6.6s] my name is Karen James Lubin .
[6.6s] I'm joined by
[9.6s] Jim or James from SDR and Victor Wong.
[13.3s] We are old friends.
[15.1s] We also run a company together, called block apps, which has been in operation for for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[24.0s] We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
[30.0s] So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum
[35.1s] and enjoyed
[36.6s] the really crazy and wild ride, you know, that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
[46.2s] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened.
[52.1s] And so we wanted to kind of, know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for for posterity, and here we are.
[60.0s] So with that said, I'll, kinda take the lead on the discussion, but we you know, we're we're not trying to be formal here .
[60.0s] Trying to make it conversational.
[66.9s] This is a first
[69.2s] of a, you know, current produced podcast
[72.4s] of sorts .
[72.4s] I've been on a bunch of them .
[72.4s] I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes.
[79.4s] Alrighty.
[80.2s] So let's let's start out with
[83.0s] the question,
[84.2s] when were you first aware of Bitcoin
[87.0s] and blockchain in particular ?
[87.0s] I'll give my answer to start,
[92.2s] and
[93.2s] there's still a kicking myself aspect to it .
[93.2s] So I became aware I'm gonna say 2010,
[99.5s] possibly 2011,
[100.9s] so this would have been my senior year in undergrad,
[105.5s] of Bitcoin .
[105.5s] And I distinctly remember it being $3
[109.2s] down from a recent peak of 14 or $15.
[113.3s] I thought it was interesting
[115.1s] and,
[115.9s] you know, looked into it a little bit .
[115.9s] I didn't really get the idea of decentralization
[120.5s] at the time .
[120.5s] I just imagined it as
[122.9s] some sort of digital money solution .
[122.9s] You know, I'd
[127.3s] if you ask me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and,
[131.4s] you know, digital
[132.6s] banking or a pay a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing .
[132.6s] And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough,
[141.3s] of course .
[141.3s] So,
[144.2s] that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[148.2s] When were you first aware of Bitcoin slash Where is different than, like, interested ?
[148.2s] In fact, like, I I don't know .
[148.2s] I was like I I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it .
[148.2s] But but I was, like, a little bit too too above all that .
[148.2s] Like, oh, that's like a money thing .
[148.2s] I'm I'm not interested in that money world.
[167.1s] So,
[168.2s] really, no .
[168.2s] Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, was a,
[173.1s] an old friend of mine and that
[176.0s] Kieran had been following his blog.
[178.2s] And
[179.1s] and,
[180.2s] Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you you have to go look at this Ethereum thing .
[180.2s] And so, at first, I was like, yeah .
[180.2s] You know, I'm not interested in all this this
[191.6s] fake money thing.
[193.1s] And I went and I read the white paper.
[195.6s] And by the end of the white paper, I was I was hooked in .
[195.6s] I was like, this isn't just about, like like, banking or something .
[195.6s] This is about incentivization
[203.9s] on the Internet, and that drew me in .
[203.9s] So
[207.8s] and at that point, I I and there was enough ambiguous
[211.7s] stuff being discussed .
[211.7s] I I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked .
[211.7s] So that's when I I started, like, trying to write code that would, connect to one of the peers and see how they and and at the time, it was a test net.
[225.1s] And, and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there .
[225.1s] So,
[230.6s] well, I don't know .
[230.6s] Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[232.9s] Yeah .
[232.9s] Let's, Jim, we'll pick that up .
[232.9s] I'm I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological,
[237.7s] so I you know, 2010,
[239.4s] 2011 sounds like same time frame for you .
[239.4s] I think, we'll pull back in a
[244.5s] question or two
[246.1s] right to that era,
[248.1s] and we'll talk in in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[250.3s] But let's let's hold on it for just a a moment .
[250.3s] Vic, do you wanna take it ?
[250.3s] Yeah .
[250.3s] I think I became aware of it around the same time as you .
[250.3s] I was I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and
[263.9s] I I felt really disconnected
[265.9s] from North America, so I became sort of an early
[269.3s] fan of podcasts.
[271.3s] And one of the big podcast networks
[274.1s] was this thing called Twit that was, like, all technical podcasts .
[274.1s] And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast,
[280.3s] security now, which went really deep into these kind of, like, security technical kind of things .
[280.3s] And he did, like, a couple episodes of Bitcoin.
[289.0s] And I was, like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like and even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin .
[289.0s] Or if I did, I did notice it .
[289.0s] I I wish I think the rewards were, like, 50 at the time or something like this .
[289.0s] But the the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other
[314.5s] Chinese startups, there'd be, like, groups of computers in, like, part of their office .
[314.5s] And I was like, what are those for ?
[314.5s] And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin .
[314.5s] And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin ?
[314.5s] And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can, like, transfer money and, like, it's basically free Internet magic money .
[314.5s] And I was like,
[333.5s] I I honestly was were kind of repelled by that .
[333.5s] Like, that kind of seemed, like, too nutty even for me at the time.
[340.8s] Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[343.6s] I never hated it .
[343.6s] I was sort of just, like,
[346.8s] not that interested, I guess.
[349.9s] You know, I think,
[351.3s] you know, from
[353.0s] the
[353.9s] East Coast,
[356.2s] the attitude towards, like, stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable .
[356.2s] I think, Jimmy, would long since been out in California doing, like, yeah, you know, after your physics days .
[356.2s] But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda like like, I guess I didn't hate it .
[356.2s] I just felt I was too good for it.
[373.9s] I see .
[373.9s] I I didn't hate it, but I think

**SPEAKER_02:**
[377.6s] I found
[379.3s] the like
[381.4s] like, everyone talked about so I was fascinated the technical aspect, like I said .
[381.4s] Like, you know, I and it got me to read the white paper and even, like, download the software .
[381.4s] But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they're like
[402.7s] they were, like, kind of fanatical.
[404.8s] Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say .
[404.8s] Yeah .
[404.8s] Jim, I would say

**SPEAKER_00:**
[413.4s] the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic
[417.6s] track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored
[427.4s] crypto.
[428.8s] Some of them weighed in on it,
[430.9s] but,
[431.8s] yeah, I I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract, like, the classically most
[437.6s] successful in some sense people at that time, Whereas,
[441.8s] you know, fighting against,
[443.7s] not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs, like, in math or physics or or something .
[443.7s] It's just like the
[449.4s] most horsepower wins from a, you know, intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest working horsepower.
[455.4s] Very few of those people
[457.8s] got interested
[459.6s] in in,
[461.4s] you know, crypto blockchain .
[461.4s] A few cryptographers
[464.3s] certainly did and probably actually more established ones
[468.1s] as far as, you know, compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Benet, etcetera .
[468.1s] But, yeah, I think
[475.0s] I don't know that it was that I was too good for it,
[478.1s] but that,
[480.4s] one, I didn't grasp right away that it was
[483.3s] revolutionary,
[484.8s] and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess .
[484.8s] Yeah .
[484.8s] I I would describe my view of it in the early days was

**SPEAKER_02:**
[493.6s] sketchy because
[495.2s] most of the use cases that like, I thought the technology was fascinating,
[499.8s] but whenever I would ask about you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case ?
[499.8s] Why would you use it ?
[499.8s] And people would describe,
[507.4s] you know, things to circumvent existing laws .
[507.4s] Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff .
[507.4s] And I was like, is that legal ?
[507.4s] And, like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[524.4s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[525.5s] Well, I I wanna say I got Sorry .
[525.5s] I

**SPEAKER_01:**
[528.0s] got over feeling too good for it .
[528.0s] I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[531.9s] Yeah .
[531.9s] And we all did it .
[531.9s] Yeah.
[535.4s] I I wanna touch on the other the big thing that sticks out of my memory
[541.1s] from the the early blockchain era is and and we've
[546.0s] kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mt .
[546.0s] Gox .
[546.0s] So Mt .
[546.0s] Gox
[551.1s] Mhmm .
[551.1s] Was that first big price run up .
[551.1s] I believe Bitcoin went from, like, $30 to
[557.9s] $1,200
[559.0s] in Yep .
[559.0s] A pretty short time frame.
[562.0s] And as we've seen in the last couple,
[565.2s] you know, crypto,
[566.5s] you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person.
[570.9s] To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price,
[574.8s] and,
[576.5s] people are getting excited about price momentum.
[579.2s] Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing .
[579.2s] More people come in, and it goes all the way up .
[579.2s] And then seemingly invariably,
[585.6s] the bubble bursts,
[586.9s] and someone is fleeced at the top.
[590.1s] You know?
[592.3s] And, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof,
[599.4s] everyone's hurt on the other side .
[599.4s] And then sort of the crypto is somehow this way of surviving all of this .
[599.4s] The protocols themselves seem to be, you know, quite sound.
[609.1s] But I guess the question is,
[611.7s] do you guys remember Mt .
[611.7s] Gox distinctly ?
[611.7s] I feel like everyone lots of people I knew who were not
[619.1s] quite

**SPEAKER_01:**
[620.0s] crypto savvy in the industry, etcetera, were suddenly paying attention when was happening .
[620.0s] With the hot topic just getting into things .
[620.0s] Yeah .
[620.0s] I I what year was it ?
[620.0s] Was it 2015, 2014 ?
[620.0s] 2014, probably .
[620.0s] Right ?
[620.0s] I think docs was 13 .
[620.0s] Let me check .
[620.0s] Yeah .
[620.0s] I think was 13.
[636.6s] Yeah .
[636.6s] Okay .
[636.6s] So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.
[644.1s] I was new enough to it that it was still I was observing it as a, you know, like, a third party.
[650.4s] You know ?
[650.4s] It was it was interesting to me .
[650.4s] But but, yeah, I I think I I spent a little time to understand
[657.2s] what because, you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it .
[657.2s] They didn't explain what was going on .
[657.2s] So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but, no, it had nothing to do with blockchain.
[668.6s] It was,
[669.7s] it was oh, there's

**SPEAKER_00:**
[671.8s] I think you're right .
[671.8s] So the run up was actually '13
[676.1s] into the '14,
[678.1s] it it looks like .
[678.1s] Or okay .
[678.1s] So it officially shuttered February.
[683.0s] Though
[683.9s] and the big the 1200 that I remember was, like, November
[688.4s] 2013,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[689.4s] it looks like .
[689.4s] When did the hack happen ?
[689.4s] December .
[689.4s] Oh, it happened .
[689.4s] Right here .
[689.4s] Okay .
[689.4s] Okay .
[689.4s] Yeah .
[689.4s] Happened right there .
[689.4s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[697.5s] So,
[698.6s] yeah, interesting times for sure .
[698.6s] Because I think MonkDocs

**SPEAKER_02:**
[702.6s] and oh, what was I'm blanking right now .
[702.6s] What what was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road .
[702.6s] Silk Road .
[702.6s] Yeah .
[702.6s] Like, I think it's
[713.7s] those were kind of intertwined
[715.9s] in in those early days .
[715.9s] Right ?
[715.9s] So I remember,
[719.6s] like, even you going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kinda shocked with what I saw listed there .
[719.6s] Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was list listed there .
[719.6s] You know ?
[719.6s] That's

**SPEAKER_00:**
[732.8s] wow .
[732.8s] You know, I think I never did that .
[732.8s] I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road.
[738.3s] Just heard about it at length .
[738.3s] I had an account,
[742.0s] and some others .
[742.0s] There's a period where, like, was
[745.5s] doing crypto stuff,
[747.6s] and then I think they stopped.
[749.8s] And I I believe they're still around as, like, a payment API company.
[754.2s] But

**SPEAKER_02:**
[755.9s] Yeah .
[755.9s] Because I I remember them and some others .
[755.9s] I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt .
[755.9s] Gox hacks
[762.0s] came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was, like, the sort of, like you know,
[769.5s] as we've as you mentioned, like, the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then and then it just keeps coming back .
[769.5s] Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[779.4s] Yeah .
[779.4s] It sure does.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[782.1s] Okay .
[782.1s] There's a little bit of bias in the new the news on how they cover,
[786.9s] problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional,
[790.8s] world .
[790.8s] Like, if if there's if there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place .
[790.8s] And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person.
[805.9s] So it's always, like,
[808.5s] much more tied into you know, the the price of of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens.
[814.2s] But you don't see, like, crashing because, like, somebody commits fraud somewhere.
[819.5s] I mean, I guess fraud's big enough .
[819.5s] But

**SPEAKER_00:**
[823.1s] Yeah .
[823.1s] Agreed.
[825.4s] Just segue
[826.7s] does happen sometimes.
[828.2s] Yeah.
[829.7s] Segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met ?
[829.7s] Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all Yeah .
[829.7s] Jim, do do I do I wanna start, or do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[840.9s] I'll start, and and I'll pass it over .
[840.9s] I, actually
[845.2s] so I had,
[847.4s] back in the nineties, was in academia in the in the aughts.
[850.7s] I was, in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups .
[850.7s] And I was ending one of my startups,
[855.7s] and I had,
[857.6s] two sons who were in the our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school.
[865.5s] And I,
[867.8s] at at this time, there was just a coincidence .
[867.8s] Both my wife and I,
[872.0s] had ended jobs.
[873.6s] And we said, hey .
[873.6s] Let's just been crazy right now, and and let's let's take this to to its extension .
[873.6s] Let's let's go to
[881.1s] China and actually put them in a school there .
[881.1s] So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded
[891.1s] a startup of Victor's in Beijing .
[891.1s] And he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys .
[891.1s] So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now, and you can explain .
[891.1s] Well yeah .
[891.1s] And and so the VC,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[900.7s] you know, who we're still friends with, like,
[903.3s] he kinda came up to me, and he he explicitly said,
[906.6s] like, oh, I have this brilliant CTO,
[909.3s] and he says he wants to come to China .
[909.3s] I'm not sure how serious he is .
[909.3s] So you know what ?
[909.3s] Don't put all your eggs in this basket .
[909.3s] But then we started
[917.9s] talking that summer,
[920.5s] and you weren't, like, traveling in the country, so you were, like, in a different place every couple of advantage of us both

**SPEAKER_01:**
[927.4s] being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[931.7s] And and I remember, like, you know, like, we were kinda talking over the summer, and I was, like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming .
[931.7s] And
[941.0s] and at one point, you said, okay .
[941.0s] Look .
[941.0s] If you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing .
[941.0s] And I
[951.1s] went to the school that my kids went to, which and
[955.2s] said, like, you know, can you make space for,
[959.5s] you know, two foreign kids, this inter international program ?
[959.5s] They said, yes.
[964.2s] If you can but the kids have to be here the first day of school .
[964.2s] And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.
[970.8s] So I called Jim up and said, look .
[970.8s] I can do it .
[970.8s] You know, I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day .
[970.8s] And to my shock, he actually said yes, and he, like, parked up his house and, like, you know, he turned off packed everything in the house in, like I think we had twelve days to be in school, and we probably were

**SPEAKER_01:**
[990.1s] the had to have the house back within,
[992.8s] like like, I don't know, less than a week .
[992.8s] So Yeah .
[992.8s] That was a crazy week.
[997.3s] But but
[999.3s] Victor was a great help in like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about .
[999.3s] Victor had also, moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything .
[999.3s] And he knew he knew where the good schools were .
[999.3s] He knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1016.1s] So Yeah .
[1016.1s] It was a great experience .
[1016.1s] It was an exciting time to be in China .
[1016.1s] It was right around the first Olympics .
[1016.1s] You know ?
[1016.1s] Like, it was right around that the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time .
[1016.1s] But, yeah, you wound up staying for about eighteen months, right, in total?
[1030.0s] And A little less, but, yeah, it was it was over a year .
[1030.0s] Yeah .
[1030.0s] And then we just kept in touch from there .
[1030.0s] Like, we loved working together.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1037.6s] Yeah .
[1037.6s] It was great .
[1037.6s] Year did you arrive?
[1041.0s] Or what was this rough time to your period ?
[1041.0s] Yeah .
[1041.0s] Who were you asking ?
[1041.0s] Because it was different for me .
[1041.0s] You, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1046.2s] Oh, 2011.
[1047.8s] 2011 .
[1047.8s] Twenty eleven summer .
[1047.8s] We're driving all over the country .
[1047.8s] 2011,
[1051.9s] September,
[1052.8s] August .
[1052.8s] I can't remember .
[1052.8s] We were we were in Beijing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1056.4s] Gotcha.
[1057.2s] Gotcha .
[1057.2s] Very cool.
[1059.0s] And so then you're back
[1061.1s] 2012
[1063.3s] or early twenty thirteen, something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1066.7s] Yeah .
[1066.7s] We were back at, when did we come back ?
[1066.7s] I guess we were back in the country in 2013.
[1072.9s] Gotcha .
[1072.9s] It's about, like, January.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1075.9s] Let me I'll segue .
[1075.9s] I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep, you know, everything in my mind here
[1083.3s] consistent.
[1084.4s] So
[1086.4s] I was in grad school,
[1089.6s] at at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015.
[1094.0s] Mhmm.
[1095.7s] I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident.
[1100.4s] Maybe not purely by accident, but, basically,
[1105.1s] the
[1106.8s] I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm gonna say,
[1111.6s] 2014
[1112.8s] or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014 .
[1112.8s] So for those who have not,
[1117.9s] not aware of how,
[1119.5s] PhD program works, qualifying exam is, like, one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.
[1127.4s] So sometimes there's a coursework requirement .
[1127.4s] Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like, an academic work from one language to to another to show proficiency.
[1136.9s] I think, most of them have dropped those requirements,
[1139.7s] at this point.
[1141.1s] And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley .
[1141.1s] It's a three hour oral exam with couple people from your department and one from an external department,
[1151.4s] and then they give you a pass or not .
[1151.4s] I got a pass, thankfully .
[1151.4s] It was a
[1155.6s] I don't know that it was it was everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good .
[1155.6s] Right ?
[1155.6s] Like, and,
[1162.5s] you know, so
[1163.9s] while I passed it, I it it was, like, you know, didn't feel great the at least the rest of that day.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1171.1s] But when do you find out the result ?
[1171.1s] Like, is it Immediately .
[1171.1s] Oh, you do ?
[1171.1s] Okay .
[1171.1s] They put you in the hall, and they tell you .
[1171.1s] Yeah .
[1171.1s] Okay .
[1171.1s] That's good .
[1171.1s] So you're just, like, very nervous for I don't know what it was like for you, but for me, it was just, like, three guys I knew .
[1171.1s] And I I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and, like,
[1188.6s] you know, like, calculate numbers or something .
[1188.6s] They just kinda come out, and they're like, yeah .
[1188.6s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1193.0s] Exactly .
[1193.0s] It no .
[1193.0s] It was it was like that .
[1193.0s] Right ?
[1193.0s] Yeah .
[1193.0s] It's it's a oral .
[1193.0s] It's
[1198.0s] subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got, like, several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects .
[1198.0s] So they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.
[1212.0s] So, anyways, so
[1213.7s] I kind of
[1215.1s] the qualifying exam led to
[1218.0s] you know, I I needed, like, a short break from math .
[1218.0s] I was in mathematical physics,
[1223.1s] and I had almost taken a job working
[1226.5s] for
[1227.4s] sort of a data science company that was taking I can't quite remember.
[1233.0s] So something having to do with, like, Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to,
[1239.8s] networks .
[1239.8s] I I can't can't remember at this time.
[1243.5s] But, you know, it seemed like a okay thing .
[1243.5s] I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer .
[1243.5s] I'm from New York .
[1243.5s] And, you know, as as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it .
[1243.5s] I still,
[1257.2s] you know, I'm prone sometimes
[1259.3s] to bash the Bay Area,
[1261.3s] but I still kinda like it there.
[1263.5s] But anyway That's by the way.
[1265.6s] Yes .
[1265.6s] Yes .
[1265.6s] Jim's there .
[1265.6s] I'm I'm in the state of New York at the moment.
[1272.6s] But but yeah .
[1272.6s] But I, know, I need a little break, basically.
[1275.7s] And it ended up
[1277.8s] being possible to work on the Ethereum project.
[1280.7s] So somehow,
[1282.9s] my
[1284.0s] you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow.
[1286.6s] My dad, Joe got
[1288.5s] attached
[1289.4s] to the project basically because
[1292.1s] he was always he was tracking
[1294.5s] Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time.
[1298.0s] He had a
[1299.7s] CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years .
[1299.7s] And so it's just kind of always watching
[1306.3s] technological
[1308.3s] innovations
[1309.2s] in financial services.
[1312.6s] And I guess always had a little bit of the,
[1316.3s] you know, blockchain philosophical
[1318.6s] character,
[1319.8s] in that, you know, let's say,
[1323.0s] pro pro freedom, little little bit of a libertarian
[1326.6s] streak kinda thing.
[1330.6s] And I believe he happened to just be visiting our family .
[1330.6s] So he's from Toronto .
[1330.6s] A lot of,
[1337.3s] a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another .
[1337.3s] And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup.
[1349.0s] But
[1350.2s] this would have been January, February
[1352.9s] 2014, I believe.
[1355.5s] And Vitalik was speaking there .
[1355.5s] And,
[1359.0s] you know, like everyone around that time where
[1363.9s] you you see that Alex speak about something,
[1367.4s] you got really excited .
[1367.4s] Right ?
[1367.4s] And so he actually
[1370.6s] got ready to start helping out the project right away .
[1370.6s] He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project
[1378.6s] and, you know, it did didn't turn out that way .
[1378.6s] We can go into it, a little bit later.
[1383.2s] But
[1384.1s] he started working on it again, let's say, February, March,
[1388.3s] 2014.
[1389.7s] And so he just sent me the white paper, like, right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam .
[1389.7s] I got a chance to read it,
[1397.7s] and it was pretty cool and interesting and new .
[1397.7s] And it's that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etcetera .
[1397.7s] And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer, basically .
[1397.7s] So that's how I got into it.
[1415.5s] And,
[1416.7s] subsequently,
[1418.9s] you know, Jim Jim alluded to this earlier,
[1421.3s] I started to work with the project and
[1425.5s] reached out to Steve Shu, a great great friend of ours.
[1429.8s] Kind of
[1431.1s] I don't know .
[1431.1s] Not not quite famously brilliant .
[1431.1s] Definitely brilliant, somewhat famous.
[1436.8s] Super cool guy,
[1438.9s] and I'd I'd been a longtime reader of Steve's blog .
[1438.9s] He's one of the
[1444.3s] few really excellent
[1447.4s] kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time, I don't know, distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience, but Steve is actually good at that, but with Nuance coverage of technical topics .
[1447.4s] So, anyway,
[1464.6s] caught up with Steve,
[1467.3s] and that takes us to
[1470.4s] Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.
[1474.1s] And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York,
[1479.3s] but was just about to go back to the Bay Area .
[1479.3s] So that takes us to maybe Janu or sorry, June, July
[1485.7s] 2014.
[1488.2s] And maybe I came back in August or or something like that .
[1488.2s] And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in in Hayward,
[1495.0s] and we got to meet up
[1497.7s] I wonder if you did anything .
[1497.7s] August 2014, September, something like that ?
[1497.7s] Oh, it was around then because,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1505.0s] also, ironically,
[1506.5s] I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back .
[1506.5s] That's weird .
[1506.5s] Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip .
[1506.5s] You do a Obviously .
[1506.5s] Soul searching .
[1506.5s] You do a literal search .
[1506.5s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1520.8s] Cross country.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[1522.5s] Well See, I was in Montana, and then I was back in the Bay Area, and then we talked.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1527.3s] Yeah .
[1527.3s] Okay.
[1528.7s] That's how was Montana, by the way ?
[1528.7s] It did wow .
[1528.7s] Maybe we shouldn't go to yeah.
[1534.1s] Montana, oddly crypto friendly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1536.5s] Yeah .
[1536.5s] Yeah .
[1536.5s] Makes sense .
[1536.5s] Big Sky Country .
[1536.5s] Right ?
[1536.5s] Yeah .
[1536.5s] Big Sky Country.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1541.2s] Okay.
[1542.4s] So
[1543.6s] let me see here .
[1543.6s] I want to I have a couple other 2014
[1547.4s] anecdotes
[1548.4s] that
[1549.6s] you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead
[1555.9s] to 2015 and go back .
[1555.9s] So Just before we we go past 2014.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[1561.5s] So I moved back from
[1564.0s] China
[1565.4s] in 2014.
[1567.2s] And so, you know, me and Jim were talking about, like, oh, now that we were I was back, what kind of project could we do together ?
[1567.2s] So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were, like, thinking about, okay .
[1567.2s] You know, like, maybe we could work on the startup together.
[1581.3s] And at some point, you forward me the paper as well .
[1581.3s] So, like, I think once so that's that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[1590.5s] I I wanna give yeah .
[1590.5s] I I don't wanna speak the whole time, but but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length .
[1590.5s] Okay .
[1590.5s] Go for it.
[1600.0s] In
[1601.8s] 2014
[1603.5s] so so, basically, I
[1606.6s] did work on the Ethereum projects through a bunch of twenty fourteen.
[1613.0s] As far as tech projects go, it was much more global,
[1618.3s] little more European,
[1619.8s] but, you know, you had Canada .
[1619.8s] You got a had a bunch of people in Zug,
[1624.0s] Switzerland,
[1625.9s] a little bit in Israel in the early days.
[1629.3s] The
[1630.6s] we worked out of an office.
[1633.5s] My dad and I and
[1637.6s] guy named Steven who
[1639.7s] is now
[1641.1s] kinda famous .
[1641.1s] Actually, if you Google the name, you know, it's, it's definitely an interesting and and colorful story,
[1647.8s] that I'll go into a little bit .
[1647.8s] And a guy named Jonathan, whose last name I I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a a good guy .
[1647.8s] And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or, you know, how how that all happened.
[1661.7s] So we're working in this office in
[1665.7s] Times Square and,
[1667.8s] you know, really
[1668.9s] trying to find kind of different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people.
[1674.2s] So, you know, that's when I met
[1676.9s] Steve who introduced
[1678.6s] me to Jim, basically, just kind of calling up whoever might be interested .
[1678.6s] But part of the plans that the Ethereum
[1686.7s] folks had was you know, they had the
[1689.7s] they acknowledged
[1690.9s] that
[1693.3s] there would be a need for kinda ongoing pure research and then in addition to more, like, focused r and d to to build the network out.
[1702.2s] And
[1703.2s] so Vitalik, at some point, penned an article about, you know, 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or or something of that nature
[1710.3s] in which and I think it was,
[1713.5s] if we went back now, it would look both, you know,
[1717.2s] very insightful and a little bit dated .
[1717.2s] I'm sure some of them have been solved, and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged.
[1726.9s] But, basically, he foresaw that they the the need for,
[1730.5s] you know, privacy above and beyond
[1733.4s] pseudonymity,
[1734.3s] for instance .
[1734.3s] Yeah .
[1734.3s] Or and, you know, many things of that transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just like energy efficient blockchains, which people were talking about at that time .
[1734.3s] But,
[1744.9s] you know, my
[1746.5s] position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful
[1750.0s] as, you know, the
[1752.1s] the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people despite being, like, both of them being really smart groups of people.
[1760.4s] Blockchain people were not worried about, like, doing things through the proper channels and,
[1766.8s] you know, approval and writing it up the right way and, you know, all that sort of thing .
[1766.8s] Whereas, you know, something about academia
[1773.1s] makes you
[1775.5s] fearful of being wrong,
[1777.8s] because you're you're you're wrong enough in public.
[1781.3s] There are kind of consequences for it.
[1784.3s] And the kind of I would say the tech attitude in general is, like, getting something out there .
[1784.3s] You know,
[1790.1s] get it to work, basically, but get it out and then iterate.
[1795.5s] And
[1797.3s] blockchain people had that,
[1799.2s] you know, in a
[1801.3s] extreme .
[1801.3s] And I I would say, also,
[1803.6s] Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture .
[1803.6s] The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of
[1809.1s] practicing but academic cryptographers
[1811.3s] who never wanted to change anything.
[1815.4s] And the Ethereum people were more like
[1818.2s] have, like, the software and computer science engineering attitude of, like, well, let's get out there .
[1818.2s] Let's let's tinker with it .
[1818.2s] Let's kinda see what happens .
[1818.2s] And, you there's good arguments for both, especially when we're talking about, like, a system that custodies
[1829.8s] well, not custodies, but, you know, that
[1832.5s] records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred.
[1838.5s] But
[1840.3s] all that is to say, it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have sort of someone who's actively in academia to kinda work with and coordinate everything .
[1840.3s] So we
[1850.2s] agreed to work on a body called the cryptocurrency research group,
[1855.9s] and that was composed of sort of myself,
[1859.5s] Vitalik,
[1860.5s] and our friend Aaron Wright.
[1863.1s] Was kind of the he's a since going on to a number of web three projects, but at the time was a practicing
[1870.4s] attorney,
[1871.8s] but also a professor at Cardoso
[1874.0s] Law School.
[1875.3s] And he came to that Times Square office, which was, you know, not the greatest of offices, I would I would say, and just sorta really leaned in on,
[1885.2s] Ethereum
[1886.1s] and kinda helped
[1888.5s] structure everything
[1891.5s] so that,
[1893.1s] you know, it would be kind of the most robust,
[1896.2s] not just technology, but they they actually did kind of a quite good job in figuring out,
[1900.9s] how to set things up,
[1902.8s] that other projects since did you know, certainly did not do as as good a job, I'll say.
[1909.0s] So, you know, it was it was funny times.
[1912.8s] And in 2014, I also got to go to
[1916.0s] Zug.
[1918.1s] For those who don't know, the Ethereum Foundation
[1921.6s] was one of the first to head to to be headquartered
[1926.2s] in
[1927.2s] Switzerland,
[1928.3s] and it was kind of it's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations,
[1934.0s] because I guess the Ethereum Foundation
[1936.7s] sort of blazed a path.
[1939.8s] And okay .
[1939.8s] Funny thing about Switzerland
[1942.0s] is that the kind of local authorities
[1946.0s] also just seem like business people .
[1946.0s] Like, they wanna land the future tax revenue and employment.
[1952.1s] And so you can kind of
[1954.0s] once Switzerland is split into some number of Cantons, which are like states, well, a little smaller than US states, of course.
[1961.0s] And
[1962.1s] so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer .
[1962.1s] And offer really means, like, you know, tax treatment,
[1972.7s] any kind of grants, or just like you know ?
[1972.7s] And and and helping
[1977.3s] get fast answers
[1979.1s] around legal questions .
[1979.1s] You know, one of the tough things with The United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed.
[1986.7s] And
[1988.2s] the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear, you know, about what what they wanted for the special tax treatment and, you know, etcetera, etcetera .
[1988.2s] So
[1998.1s] so we went out and visited Zug,
[2002.1s] I don't know, mid late summer twenty fourteen, and I got to meet
[2008.2s] all of the founders of Ethereum at that time .
[2008.2s] I believe there are kind of eight in total.
[2016.2s] And
[2017.3s] yeah .
[2017.3s] So I think

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2019.3s] Those numbers changed over time, though .
[2019.3s] Yeah .
[2019.3s] Those numbers changed .
[2019.3s] Yes .
[2019.3s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2023.6s] well but but yeah .
[2023.6s] I think so
[2026.1s] I don't exactly know how all of it happened,
[2028.8s] but, you know, Vitalik there's always a global project .
[2028.8s] Right ?
[2028.8s] So Vitalik would kinda go around the world and evangelize,
[2035.1s] get people excited,
[2036.6s] and they would wanna work with the project.
[2039.7s] And so
[2042.0s] a bunch of folks got attached to it.
[2046.5s] And,
[2047.4s] you know, it it I think, obviously, it worked .
[2047.4s] Right ?
[2047.4s] But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about
[2057.1s] adding folks to it because it eight is just, like, too many .
[2057.1s] Like, if you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight cofounders,
[2066.4s] and they're not all,
[2067.7s] you know, currently running billion dollar companies,
[2071.3s] you'd be just laughed out of the room .
[2071.3s] And yet it it worked .
[2071.3s] Right ?
[2071.3s] It actually functioned.
[2079.8s] And the you know ?
[2079.8s] So kind of the way it broke apart was that there were, like, the technical element
[2087.9s] technical guys .
[2087.9s] So I think I don't quite know how this happened, but pretty early on, like, Gavin Wood,
[2094.3s] Jeff Wilkie
[2095.8s] started
[2098.2s] building out versions of Ethereum,
[2101.8s] the c plus plus and
[2104.0s] Go
[2104.9s] clients .
[2104.9s] Specifically, we're going to the clients soon because there's good stories there.
[2110.7s] Metallic was building the Python client .
[2110.7s] They were all working together on technical documentation.
[2117.7s] And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that Bitcoin was controlled and centralized
[2125.9s] because there's only really one definitive client, Bitcoin d .
[2125.9s] Right?
[2130.8s] And
[2131.9s] so
[2132.8s] there was this kinda huge
[2135.3s] replication of technical effort .
[2135.3s] Like, each of them eventually got their own teams .
[2135.3s] There were JavaScript clients.
[2140.8s] You know, there's, you know, many of them kinda came out later.
[2146.6s] And
[2147.5s] I'd say the project
[2149.3s] so the project had sort of tech folks and business folks, like like any
[2154.6s] tech project
[2155.9s] didn't really have a nominal CEO at at any time .
[2155.9s] It
[2160.4s] was closest to being Charles Hoskinson.
[2163.9s] So
[2165.3s] I think at the time I went to Zug,
[2168.4s] the
[2170.4s] leadership
[2171.3s] looked like
[2174.0s] on the business side, Charles is the CEO.
[2178.1s] Emir,
[2179.9s] who is in Israel, he kinda did
[2182.4s] business development .
[2182.4s] He's a funny guy.
[2184.8s] I still see him
[2186.5s] every once in a while.
[2190.5s] Joe, my dad, and Anthony DiOrio as
[2193.6s] the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience.
[2199.3s] And then the tech side
[2201.2s] was Vitalik,
[2203.2s] Jeff,
[2204.1s] Gavin,
[2205.2s] and then Mihai
[2207.1s] had sort of done corporate setup .
[2207.1s] I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine.
[2213.2s] So Vitalik,
[2214.9s] very
[2216.2s] interesting character where, you know, most of the time, your technical geniuses are not good communicators,
[2221.7s] and
[2222.7s] he was sort of a journalist
[2224.6s] running Bitcoin magazine,
[2226.4s] running a lot of the articles.
[2228.0s] I don't know if he started it or kind of joined it.
[2233.7s] And, you know, he would, he would I think he kinda crowdfunded
[2237.8s] the articles a little bit .
[2237.8s] Like,
[2240.7s] for you know, if I can get a pledge of 1 Bitcoin, I'll write an article about x .
[2240.7s] You know ?
[2240.7s] And at the time, Bitcoin was
[2247.7s] inexpensive,
[2248.9s] but, you know, those those values went up, and I I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism,
[2254.6s] you know, the articles he wrote in the future .
[2254.6s] And it led him to kind of have a
[2259.6s] sort of impartial
[2260.8s] thought leader position in addition to his
[2264.3s] really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating, etcetera .
[2264.3s] And I know he had joined a bunch of projects
[2270.8s] early on
[2272.2s] and helped work with them.
[2275.1s] Like, I think Mastercoin
[2276.7s] was maybe the first colored coin project .
[2276.7s] He did some work on that .
[2276.7s] So,
[2282.5s] anyway, so those were the eight at the time.
[2285.3s] And
[2286.8s] the there was a meeting for everyone to kinda get on the same page .
[2286.8s] You know, remote project, there was a Slack.
[2293.5s] People were
[2295.5s] maybe working a little bit at cross purposes,
[2298.1s] lots of infighting .
[2298.1s] People are stressed .
[2298.1s] They're trying to deliver on this, like, awesome concepts that Vitalik put out there.
[2305.0s] And then everyone kinda tried to grab ownership of .
[2305.0s] Like, was there a reason to have all these different clients ?
[2305.0s] You know, in the end, empirically, it worked .
[2305.0s] Right ?
[2305.0s] But a little bit of it was a,
[2315.7s] want,
[2316.6s] you know, Ethereum to be mine sort of thing .
[2316.6s] And
[2320.3s] he's I saw this in the room
[2324.0s] when we're we're visiting there .
[2324.0s] So, basically,
[2328.3s] it kind of quite
[2331.0s] it was quite dramatic, the trip .
[2331.0s] So so, basically, on this this trip,
[2336.7s] everyone went outside at some point, and people were kind of a little bit sick .
[2336.7s] The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing
[2344.7s] to some extent .
[2344.7s] You know ?
[2344.7s] There's always this tension .
[2344.7s] It's not probably especially early in a company where,
[2350.8s] you know, the tech people are like, what what do I need you business guy for ?
[2350.8s] Like, we're gonna make this thing, and it's, like, gonna get out there .
[2350.8s] And the the business people,
[2360.2s] you know, have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships,
[2363.6s] etcetera .
[2363.6s] And it's subjective stuff that the tech people
[2367.2s] don't like or sometimes understand.
[2371.4s] And
[2373.3s] more or less, this happened .
[2373.3s] You know ?
[2373.3s] People are uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making,
[2379.3s] and just the accusations .
[2379.3s] I don't really even you know, I I know Charles some,
[2385.8s] but I don't even really know what was going on at at that time .
[2385.8s] But there was this general sense of frustration with him .
[2385.8s] He also he seems to be, in some ways, executing well on, like, a effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of
[2404.5s] breaking people out .
[2404.5s] I know we kinda seen later,
[2408.2s] you know, I I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive,
[2412.6s] I would say.
[2414.4s] But that you know, the jury was not out at that time in my eyes .
[2414.4s] Right?
[2419.3s] And Emir also was in Target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like .
[2419.3s] And so they were both
[2427.3s] jettisoned
[2428.1s] from the project in Zug.
[2430.5s] You know ?
[2430.5s] And I was like, they were, like, out on the terrace .
[2430.5s] It's like and they had, like, a nice sort of loft that they rented that was, like, the Ethereum dev house in Zug.
[2439.3s] And so I'm, like, watching this happen and, you know, it
[2442.8s] it was kind of,
[2444.2s] you know, quite crazy.
[2446.0s] And then, actually, they instated
[2448.1s] two more cofounders,
[2450.1s] so to speak, right then,
[2452.2s] who kinda jumped on board the project and and helped out.
[2456.0s] It was a it was, like, a fun and kind of, crazy trip otherwise .
[2456.0s] You know, we went out in Zurich.
[2462.1s] Some people got in trouble
[2464.1s] with the cops .
[2464.1s] I won't add more detail to to that .
[2464.1s] But, Zurich's a funny place where in The US, we're not used to people drinking on the street .
[2464.1s] And in Zurich, everyone drinks on the street, and few people are in the bars .
[2464.1s] You know ?
[2464.1s] It's a it was a strange experience .
[2464.1s] We went on some hikes .
[2464.1s] You know ?
[2464.1s] It's it's a very nice part of the world,
[2481.3s] Switzerland .
[2481.3s] But
[2483.4s] plenty of drama, you know, in the early days .
[2483.4s] I I remember having a funny conversation with about
[2488.6s] like, he had this book about, like, swarm behavior,
[2491.5s] and, you know, he he learned I had a mathematical background as we're talking about, like, the the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.
[2498.7s] But, yeah, the the the it felt
[2502.2s] nascent,
[2504.1s] intense,
[2505.5s] but disorganized.
[2507.1s] They were also grappling with the decision on initially, they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol
[2512.7s] and a for profit .
[2512.7s] They called it crypto Google at the time
[2517.1s] to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol .
[2517.1s] And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently.
[2525.6s] But that was also
[2527.4s] decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit.
[2531.8s] Yeah .
[2531.8s] And people didn't like it .
[2531.8s] You know, some folks started talking about brain drain.
[2537.3s] It it was a mix .
[2537.3s] Some people liked it .
[2537.3s] Some some didn't.
[2540.8s] Sort of the threat being, like, you don't do this for profit, like, I'm gonna leave this this project
[2545.3s] kinda thing .
[2545.3s] And I think about everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses.
[2549.7s] So, you know,
[2551.2s] it it is what it is .
[2551.2s] But, anyways,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[2554.7s] let me let me pause and see if you got did I tell this whole story, you know, to to you guys at any point ?
[2554.7s] I I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing .
[2554.7s] But, yes, I I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect
[2568.7s] happened in all of that period short period of time.
[2572.8s] You know, that, like, I I I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes .
[2572.8s] And I think it was this all like, I think it was going on continually,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2580.9s] but it came to a head all in this one meeting .
[2580.9s] Sort of a funny memory .
[2580.9s] We so Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time, and we met with a guy named Nicholas, I believe,
[2592.4s] who maybe was the CEO or one of the founders .
[2592.4s] I just googled it .
[2592.4s] It says founder, and there's a different CEO now.
[2598.6s] But he he made this funny .
[2598.6s] He's a nice guy,
[2600.9s] and I think something happened there .
[2600.9s] I'm not quite sure.
[2604.1s] He made this funny comment .
[2604.1s] We were in an elevator,
[2607.3s] and it shows the difference between, like, the American and Swiss attitude .
[2607.3s] We're in an elevator,
[2611.7s] and it was, like, one of the ones where it's kinda hand operated and you do it yourself .
[2611.7s] And it's just like the door could just, like, easily close on you .
[2611.7s] And I was like, wow .
[2611.7s] Like, we'd
[2621.0s] never have this in The US because we're so litigious .
[2621.0s] And they said, well, yeah, Swiss attitude natural selection .
[2621.0s] Yeah .
[2621.0s] So
[2628.1s] anyways.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2630.4s] I know .
[2630.4s] Sometimes I think things get grandfathered
[2632.7s] in .
[2632.7s] Like, some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too .
[2632.7s] They are .
[2632.7s] Certainly .
[2632.7s] Yeah .
[2632.7s] It could just be that it's older there .
[2632.7s] Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2641.2s] That makes sense .
[2641.2s] But yeah .
[2641.2s] So I think the big other than
[2646.6s] some Zug
[2648.5s] you know, basically, what we saw or let me see .
[2648.5s] There was growing momentum around the project .
[2648.5s] Lots of people all over the world kinda working on it.
[2657.0s] Stuff was probably not tightly papered .
[2657.0s] You know ?
[2657.0s] There's no, like, employment agreements probably at that time .
[2657.0s] It was like
[2663.9s] but there was really intense excitement.
[2666.4s] And I think the belief that everyone was gonna be mega successful out of it, like, one way or another.
[2672.7s] You know, it's been been kind of interesting to to watch.
[2676.7s] Then, Jim, do you wanna talk about
[2680.0s] getting into it ?
[2680.0s] And I, you know, I alluded to all the different clients
[2685.0s] for of the of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one .
[2685.0s] Do you wanna tell your your report of

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2692.0s] that part now ?
[2692.0s] Well, this this part of the story, you know, when you were doing all that stuff, I was I was just I was too busy driving around the country, But I came back But it comes in a little later, like, three months later, right, or or the rest of Target .
[2692.0s] Yeah .
[2692.0s] Right at the end of the summer, right when you were coming back, I think .
[2692.0s] So
[2708.4s] and that's when when I got really interested in it .
[2708.4s] I remember, like,
[2712.3s] the whole culture so I got I got fascinated with the technology when I read the white paper .
[2712.3s] That's when I realized this was something something big.
[2720.6s] And I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit, but it was a it was a foreign culture to me .
[2720.6s] Like, we we decided,
[2728.0s] to,
[2729.7s] so Natasha, my wife, I, we decided just to see what what this world was like .
[2729.7s] We'd buy try try buying a little Bitcoin.
[2736.4s] And, I remember,
[2739.1s] we sort of we looked a little bit at the various ways to do it, and the way we decided on was to meet some someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley.
[2748.4s] And we got there, and he was toll totally the stereotype .
[2748.4s] The the dude was walking around with, like, the the five toed shoes,
[2755.6s] and,
[2757.3s] we kinda like it it it all felt very,
[2760.7s] salacious .
[2760.7s] We walked in with this packet of money in our hands, and we had to, like, meet this guy .
[2760.7s] And he spent most of the time, like Do you remember did he use, like, local Bitcoins That was popular .
[2760.7s] I I don't know if it's still in existence.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2773.4s] Local Bitcoins .
[2773.4s] Okay .
[2773.4s] Gotcha .
[2773.4s] Sorry .
[2773.4s] Go ahead, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2776.9s] Yeah .
[2776.9s] He he spent most of the time there railing against the government, how how much he hated the the US government and all the things they that you know, all the all the terrible things they were doing .
[2776.9s] We kinda, like,
[2788.3s] transferred the envelope over him, and then we pulled up the
[2791.8s] a computer or
[2793.4s] or phones or something, and we were, like, watching for six blocks to come by .
[2793.4s] And finally, it went through, and we we got our we were we were finally Bitcoin owners .
[2793.4s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2802.4s] Wait .
[2802.4s] Did you hang out with him for an hour?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2805.9s] Or did he then because I think we did wait for the six blocks .
[2805.9s] Was gonna say We may have been maybe after three, he said to us, like, you're welcome to stay here if you want, but I I find that after three, it probably won't revert or something .
[2805.9s] So maybe we oh, I remember what it was .
[2805.9s] We we went out and sat in the car for another thirty minutes just in case we had to run back in again .
[2805.9s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2826.1s] That's really funny.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2827.7s] Yeah.
[2829.3s] Oh, man .
[2829.3s] But yeah .
[2829.3s] So I I that that was our introduction into Bitcoin.
[2834.3s] And then around this time, you and I started hanging out a lot .
[2834.3s] We were meeting regularly,
[2839.2s] and
[2840.5s] I was working
[2841.9s] I I had started working on the Haskell client, and I brought you in on that .
[2841.9s] And we were,
[2846.4s] we'd have, like, these coding sessions at your place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2849.5s] Yeah,
[2850.6s] man .
[2850.6s] Okay .
[2850.6s] So we've gone to
[2853.6s] so that's fall
[2855.3s] twenty fourteen, right, when we started coding or or even,
[2859.4s] like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2860.2s] yeah .
[2860.2s] Yeah .
[2860.2s] Fall twenty fourteen .
[2860.2s] Yeah.
[2863.3s] And I'm you know, I was sort of laughing when you're talking about the overpromising.
[2866.6s] Like, I I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember,
[2871.0s] like, trying to understand what it was at the beginning .
[2871.0s] And
[2874.8s] some of some of the material out there was great, but some of it was just very vague and and overbroad .
[2874.8s] Like, I would, like, go to these YouTube videos, and people would be like, Ethereum is a new way of life .
[2874.8s] It's gonna take over as a second Internet,
[2887.5s] and we are gonna rebuild the Internet from beginning to end .
[2887.5s] And I was like, what are they talking about?
[2892.8s] And so the only way I was gonna really understand this stuff, thought, was to literally just start, like, writing code.
[2899.0s] And so so, you know, you can't you can't hide what's happening .
[2899.0s] Once once you have, like, so the I talked about the white paper, but but Gavin Wood had put up a a yellow paper at the same time, which talked about the technical details of the innards .
[2899.0s] And so I started looking through that and implementing that in in my favorite language, Haskell.
[2917.9s] And
[2919.2s] bit by bit, putting the whole EVM in Haskell code.
[2923.2s] So
[2924.1s] and that's what most of the end of the of the year was like
[2927.6s] until, I think, in December,
[2929.8s] I was
[2931.9s] so I'm from I'm from the East Coast myself.
[2934.8s] And we flew
[2937.1s] sorry.
[2938.1s] We flew out to New York, and, and I met you introduced me I you were there at the time too .
[2938.1s] You you introduced me to Joe .
[2938.1s] And, actually, I think before that too, you had had, set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and, Joe directly too.
[2953.0s] So,
[2954.7s] and just more and more with the,
[2957.2s] the fact that we had,
[2959.4s] had a working client,
[2961.6s] that we were sort of, following very closely all the changes in in the test night era before before things were solidified.
[2969.1s] We just got
[2970.4s] pulled more and more into the to that world.
[2973.7s] And I think, like, one of the big things that make sorry.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[2977.8s] I was just gonna keep we've been, you know, sort of assuming an expert audience .
[2977.8s] Can you define the term client for everybody?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[2984.7s] Oh, so,
[2986.3s] it's the software that blockchain runs on .
[2986.3s] The thing about
[2990.4s] usual software
[2992.0s] is,
[2993.0s] that, you know, like, if I just, like, gonna run a video game or something, I just get a computer and I put the software on it, and that's that's my running project.
[3000.5s] In a blockchain, it's blockchain is a distributed thing .
[3000.5s] So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on any on multiple computers simultaneously.
[3010.0s] So you're building sort of a world computer of chained
[3013.5s] nodes, they call them .
[3013.5s] And so, we were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing test for Netnda at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3022.5s] Yeah .
[3022.5s] Gotcha .
[3022.5s] Perfect.
[3026.1s] Putting us in the client arms race, if you will .
[3026.1s] That was the Yeah .
[3026.1s] One I was I was trying to make .
[3026.1s] Yeah.
[3032.3s] I wanna talk real quickly about some other things from that summer.
[3037.4s] You guys participated
[3039.0s] in the crowdsale, did you not ?
[3039.0s] That that's why you bought the Bitcoin the first time, or did you buy it sort of first ?
[3039.0s] Yeah .
[3039.0s] Got a token amount .
[3039.0s] Yeah .
[3039.0s] Gotcha.
[3048.1s] So
[3049.4s] the from our our side,
[3052.2s] we ended up mostly my dad, but obviously with help from the Ethereum people .
[3052.2s] So they they coded up a site
[3058.4s] to do the crowdsale.
[3060.3s] So Ethereum
[3062.1s] was one of the first,
[3064.0s] maybe the first,
[3067.5s] to pioneer, basically, you know, a
[3073.1s] kind of prefunding event, if you will, where they sold the token
[3077.9s] ether in exchange for Bitcoin
[3080.3s] to the users of Basically an ICO .
[3080.3s] Right ?
[3080.3s] Like, what would It was it was essentially an ICO .
[3080.3s] There was no name for it then .
[3080.3s] Yeah.
[3089.2s] But
[3090.1s] the I remember it was the price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was, like, 1 Bitcoin to 2,000
[3097.6s] ether, which, meant,
[3099.9s] you made pretty good returns if you participated
[3102.6s] in the the crowdsale and sold at the right time or still holding.
[3108.2s] So
[3109.3s] but the way it worked,
[3111.1s] it was complicated .
[3111.1s] So Ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy.
[3116.6s] The
[3117.5s] for Bitcoin,
[3118.8s] it was
[3120.6s] basically, I think the Ethereum Foundation had,
[3124.3s] to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to
[3127.4s] and so that they could mint
[3129.9s] the,
[3132.2s] the ether and the genesis block for you .
[3132.2s] And you also
[3137.2s] but the the the foundation,
[3139.0s] like, you know, rightfully in decentralization
[3141.1s] terms, did not want to just hold
[3143.6s] everybody's keys .
[3143.6s] Right ?
[3143.6s] So you had to sort of generate your own keys,
[3147.8s] and the website did this and download them .
[3147.8s] And there's these huge warnings like, you must download this file .
[3147.8s] If you lose this file, you will lose access to your funds.
[3158.7s] And so that some of the the Ethereum folks coded it up,
[3161.9s] and
[3164.5s] there was some they had to I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for for traceability sake .
[3164.5s] I'm not quite sure if they did that .
[3164.5s] Maybe there was just one
[3174.1s] exodus address or all that sort of thing .
[3174.1s] But, actually, no, there must have been just one .
[3174.1s] So we were a little bit
[3181.0s] the help desk .
[3181.0s] So sometimes people would try to find it wouldn't work,
[3185.2s] try to try to purchase Ether.
[3187.7s] And
[3189.1s] there were interesting goings on .
[3189.1s] There were there was, like, a fake Twitter account that emerged
[3194.3s] with
[3195.6s] the e and the u in Ethereum transposed .
[3195.6s] So it looked just like Ethereum, and they had assembled,
[3202.4s] you know, 25,000
[3204.3s] followers or something .
[3204.3s] No doubt bots that whatever hacker controlled or
[3208.5s] you maybe you pay for those.
[3211.2s] And they were offering special deals on ether.
[3216.0s] So it went live .
[3216.0s] So this is something that's been going on for ten years now.
[3220.9s] I you know, even I've heard new crypto projects,
[3224.8s] you know, when they start to get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now, so they've gotten more sophisticated.
[3232.6s] But yeah .
[3232.6s] So I I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping, like, escalate the ticket that you know, because
[3241.5s] the, like, a big theft could occur, and I believe did not.
[3247.7s] Jonathan
[3250.1s] configured one of the block explorers .
[3250.1s] Maybe it was blockchain.info.
[3253.6s] I can't remember .
[3253.6s] So that every time
[3255.8s] money hit a certain address, a noise would play .
[3255.8s] So we're in this room,
[3259.9s] and and we were, like, we're the room all day because it's like we're in, like, help desk mode.
[3265.4s] And we just hear the things come in, and then there was a schedule over, like, fourteen days you could fund
[3271.9s] at no
[3274.1s] monetary
[3275.7s] consequence, and then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a forty two day sale .
[3275.7s] So all in all, I think, you know, 7,000 unique
[3284.8s] purchasers,
[3285.7s] something like that.
[3287.6s] But it was, like, it was quite an affair .
[3287.6s] Right ?
[3287.6s] It it's definitely more,
[3292.7s] streamlined now.
[3294.8s] And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion,
[3298.9s] that, you know, they're selling software in essence to people
[3304.2s] from, you know, a reputable
[3306.2s] law firm
[3307.3s] and, you know, some of that all that made it to the terms and conditions .
[3307.3s] So it's a big rush to get it all done.
[3313.9s] And then so I think that raised you didn't even remember .
[3313.9s] It was, like, $22,000,000

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3318.0s] at the time .
[3318.0s] Yeah .
[3318.0s] I thought it well, it was in Bitcoin, so I think it was, like, in 20 mil well, I remember vaguely that it was At the time of the sale, it was 22,000,000.
[3328.3s] Yeah .
[3328.3s] I think it was the biggest crowdfunding

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3331.8s] event ever or something like that .
[3331.8s] I believe that's right .
[3331.8s] It's either one or two ever at that time, and it's since been surpassed by tons,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3340.9s] many of which Many were done on Ethereum .
[3340.9s] Coin that comes out .
[3340.9s] Yeah .
[3340.9s] Exactly .
[3340.9s] But, yeah, but, like, I think at the time, it was around or over 20,000,000.
[3349.9s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3350.7s] Yeah .
[3350.7s] That's that's right .
[3350.7s] And, interestingly,
[3353.1s] in the course of the sale and maybe a little bit having to do with the sale,
[3358.1s] the price of Bitcoin starts to go down.
[3360.7s] So I believe it's 600
[3362.6s] or so at the start of the sale, and it's just it's kind of we noticed it dropping
[3370.1s] kind of continually,
[3372.3s] I guess.
[3373.3s] And maybe by the end of it, it's, like, high fours, low fives, and, you know, it's foreshadowing .
[3373.3s] It'll kinda go on to drop from there.
[3383.3s] But yeah .
[3383.3s] Okay .
[3383.3s] So did you guys,
[3386.0s] remember the experience of the the
[3389.0s] the funding site and all that sort of thing ?
[3389.0s] I I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3398.9s] I remember the site .
[3398.9s] I remember a clock on it, but, I don't remember too much else about it .
[3398.9s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3404.3s] Okay .
[3404.3s] So the crowdsale is, like, not a huge part of your memory .
[3404.3s] It's a huge part of mine, I guess, because we were, like, dealing with all of the issues .
[3404.3s] But,
[3414.2s] Vic, were you you were just getting kinda interested at this time .
[3414.2s] Right ?
[3414.2s] Like Well, yeah .
[3414.2s] Exactly .
[3414.2s] Like, well, Jim, like,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3422.5s] Jim,
[3423.3s] basically,
[3424.4s] when
[3425.2s] he he was going to buy this Bitcoin, he was like, oh, I'm gonna buy this Bitcoin and to participate in the crowdsale.
[3431.6s] Do you wanna participate ?
[3431.6s] And I was like,
[3434.7s] you know, I'm gonna feel like a real idiot if I don't do anything.
[3438.9s] So I just it was just some yeah .
[3438.9s] We were just gonna say, like, oh, it's some nominal amount that we did .
[3438.9s] And, you know, of course,
[3446.2s] it's probably turned into the best investment I ever made .
[3446.2s] But, like, yeah, it was we have pulled our resources together because it was so hard.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3454.7s] It wasn't easy .
[3454.7s] Right ?
[3454.7s] You're like, generating this,
[3458.1s] 12 word seed phrases,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3459.9s] you know, this, that, the other .
[3459.9s] It just was mind bogglingly complicated, you know, so
[3465.1s] and but, like, I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual Bitcoin.
[3470.2s] Like, you know, I mean, was in the Bay Area, right, the heart of IT and all the tech things .
[3470.2s] You know, I was in Vancouver
[3478.0s] and it wasn't Vancouver was an early Bitcoin adopter,
[3481.6s] but it was still really, really hard
[3484.3s] to find anyone who would be willing to sell you Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3489.9s] Yeah .
[3489.9s] Yeah.
[3492.2s] That's very interesting.
[3495.4s] Yes .
[3495.4s] In any case,
[3498.2s] the
[3499.3s] okay .
[3499.3s] So the sale happens,
[3501.1s] and now the project is funded,
[3504.1s] and it's really funded.
[3506.7s] You know?
[3508.5s] I suppose, you know, there there are plenty of mega VC investments
[3512.1s] at that time, but it's
[3514.2s] you know, the the
[3516.5s] bubble years in, you know, 2020,
[3518.9s] 2021
[3520.2s] were not heard of at this time .
[3520.2s] Like, you know, series a investments were still between, like, March.
[3527.8s] Salary is probably a little lower than they are now back then.
[3532.3s] This was a lot of money .
[3532.3s] And so
[3535.0s] the Ethereum folks then kind of
[3538.0s] it was it was very technically driven .
[3538.0s] They kicked in
[3543.0s] all of their technical dreams, so to speak .
[3543.0s] So so Jim's point about the really big claims, they really were,
[3550.2s] in a sense, trying to create
[3552.3s] a whole new Internet.
[3554.9s] A couple examples .
[3554.9s] So not just the proliferation of
[3558.7s] clients .
[3558.7s] Right ?
[3558.7s] They're gonna make a browser, the Mist browser .
[3558.7s] They're gonna make a peer to peer
[3564.7s] messaging system
[3566.5s] called Whisper.
[3568.1s] They're gonna make a decentralized
[3569.8s] file storage system .
[3569.8s] They made
[3572.5s] they chose to make
[3575.5s] a virtual machine like Java.
[3578.0s] And,
[3578.8s] you know, we always thought that, like, JavaScript was the better analogy because it kinda won on the Internet .
[3578.8s] You know, has anyone ever seen an applet in the last fifteen, twenty years?
[3588.2s] But
[3589.4s] they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM.
[3593.7s] And, you know, there's some benefit to that .
[3593.7s] It's could definitely evolve over time.
[3599.1s] I I don't know .
[3599.1s] Did you have a more specific memory of, like, they were making a lot of stuff .
[3599.1s] It was it was
[3606.2s] can you get into the experience of trying to make something compatible
[3609.7s] with what they were doing at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3612.9s] Well, once I found the yellow paper, it wasn't as difficult because that centered me around the blockchain part of it .
[3612.9s] But I it was that earlier marketing material that was very confusing to me because they would talk about you know, you would definitely see these videos like, what is Ethereum?
[3627.8s] And then it would just go off onto all these things like you mentioned, a browser or a messaging system.
[3633.8s] And I think there was even some talk in there about replacing TCP IP or something .
[3633.8s] I I I can't remember .
[3633.8s] Some of these things actually
[3641.8s] came into being .
[3641.8s] Some of these didn't.
[3644.8s] And so I think my learning process was, like, first realizing
[3650.0s] what blockchain was,
[3652.4s] but then, like, digging a little deeper and being confused that I didn't really know what was happening because I thought this was gonna be a blockchain project, and then they were talking about writing browsers.
[3662.0s] And then and then realizing when I saw the yellow paper that, yeah, this is the core of what Ethereum is .
[3662.0s] That other stuff is sort of like pipe dream stuff that may or may not come to being,
[3671.9s] but but yeah.
[3673.8s] So that's how it went .
[3673.8s] And then then once I got into the concrete
[3679.4s] test net work,
[3681.1s] that then I understood what was going on .
[3681.1s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3685.3s] Gotcha.
[3686.5s] Yeah .
[3686.5s] Yeah .
[3686.5s] It was
[3689.2s] it was wild.
[3691.6s] So
[3692.8s] and I I'm I'm struggling to remember the timing on all of this .
[3692.8s] Actually, no .
[3692.8s] I'll go to I'll go to kind of to Economicon first.
[3701.8s] And then
[3703.2s] so now we're going into
[3705.6s] January
[3706.8s] or so 2015.
[3710.8s] So
[3711.6s] a couple times
[3713.1s] so Vitalik visits the Bay Area a bunch.
[3716.5s] Did you remember
[3717.8s] we we went to a couple meetups with Vitalik .
[3717.8s] Did we not ?
[3717.8s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3722.0s] He was think he was super casual .
[3722.0s] I remember it's it's funny because, like, now now he's he's famous .
[3722.0s] But but in those days, we would just sort of, like, hang out with him after the meetings, and and he would kinda, like, go and bum a,
[3734.9s] you know, like, a a couch to sleep on in the night .
[3734.9s] One time we, like, drove him to somebody that he found a couch to sleep on .
[3734.9s] Just
[3742.1s] fun casual times.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3744.0s] Yeah .
[3744.0s] Yeah .
[3744.0s] There was I think he so he won the teal fellowship, so there were, like, beds there .
[3744.0s] And I have a memory of
[3751.0s] I think we drove well, there was a meet up in, like, the South Bay and, like, you drove them into the city or or something like that .
[3751.0s] There was a a crypto castle in SF at that time that we occasionally
[3763.1s] visited, and Besu could hang out there.
[3767.0s] You know, it was
[3768.8s] I imagine he still,
[3770.5s] you know,
[3772.7s] really has this little need for creature comforts .
[3772.7s] I'm sure he could procure whatever he likes.
[3777.2s] But,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3778.2s] you know, it was it was funny times for sure .
[3778.2s] Some really nice couches nowadays .
[3778.2s] You know ?
[3778.2s] Really nice couches
[3784.7s] these days.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3786.0s] Yeah.
[3788.7s] But
[3789.9s] so
[3790.8s] I can't even remember quite how we got the idea,
[3793.9s] but we were talking about
[3796.5s] for whatever reason, a bunch of people were going to be in the Bay Area late January
[3801.9s] twenty fifteen.
[3804.6s] And we decided to and I had also so through Steve,
[3810.2s] through Ben,
[3811.3s] who's a great guy, who is at the time sort of the I think he's head of data science, but also really the head kinda head of content for O'Reilly's conferences
[3820.3s] and that sort of thing.
[3824.0s] We
[3825.2s] booked a conference
[3828.6s] at Fort Mason, and I had a cohost named Lauren Lance, also running a crypto startup these days, I believe .
[3828.6s] Also a great guy.
[3837.6s] And
[3839.5s] we
[3840.6s] so given that the conference was on the calendar and we knew a bunch of people in part for the conference, but I think something else was going on too would be in the Bay Area at that time, we decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference,
[3852.6s] that week,
[3854.2s] which we named
[3856.1s] the verbose
[3857.3s] cryptoeconomicon.
[3859.8s] I think the term cryptoeconomics
[3861.6s] either was invented or popularized
[3863.8s] by Vitalik .
[3863.8s] There's also this guy named, Vlad .
[3863.8s] It's .
[3863.8s] I don't know quite how to pronounce his last name.
[3871.5s] He was working a lot with Metallic on
[3874.9s] proof of stake and other things and went on to start his own,
[3878.3s] I think, fairly successful crypto project, the name of which is currently escaping me .
[3878.3s] Well, he worked for proof of stake for a long time .
[3878.3s] Right ?
[3878.3s] Like, then he He did .
[3878.3s] Have complete proof of stake .
[3878.3s] But I think he, yeah, I think he did it for the foundation for a while, but then started his own thing sometime later.
[3894.7s] Funny guy .
[3894.7s] But he would say, like, crypto economics .
[3894.7s] Is it crypto, or is it economics?
[3899.9s] And it sort of never really stuck, but that was the theme of the conference .
[3899.9s] So
[3904.7s] we had, like, two academic track days and a business track day,
[3910.3s] I believe .
[3910.3s] And we had a bunch of speakers,
[3913.8s] one of whom's you know, so we spoke at the O'Reilly meeting and then would also speak at crypto.
[3921.1s] The building we
[3923.1s] did it in
[3925.1s] so we were
[3926.8s] it was cohosted with a company called Coinify, which I don't believe exists anymore.
[3931.8s] I had a nice guy named Tom Ding .
[3931.8s] But I guess Tom Ding had, like, some good,
[3936.9s] you know, plug ins for capital and access with the
[3940.6s] Chinese government ?
[3940.6s] Like like, the the bill Vic, do you remember the details around who
[3946.1s] owned that building?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3947.7s] I think it was some
[3949.3s] construction conglomerate.
[3951.1s] I remember Yeah .
[3951.1s] Talking him going like, what ?
[3951.1s] Like, what does this have to do with construction ?
[3951.1s] You know ?
[3951.1s] It didn't have anything to do with tech at all .
[3951.1s] Like, it was just Yeah .
[3951.1s] That's the that's the thing I that's the thing I remember most about it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3965.2s] So Yes .
[3965.2s] So in this

**SPEAKER_01:**
[3967.6s] I just wanna say I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference too .
[3967.6s] Well, no .
[3967.6s] We we met each other in we'd already been having conversations

**SPEAKER_02:**
[3975.9s] online,
[3977.1s] I think, like, because you guys would get together and we'd, like, chat sometimes, but we'd never actually met each other in person
[3983.5s] until that conference.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[3985.5s] Yeah .
[3985.5s] It was, like, a month or two or three in,
[3989.4s] I think, at that time .
[3989.4s] Yeah.
[3993.3s] And it it was like it was a cast of characters .
[3993.3s] Like,
[3997.0s] the the O'Reilly conference is a little more shiny corporate.
[4001.3s] Yeah .
[4001.3s] About three, four hundred attendees, something like that .
[4001.3s] Pretty pretty successful.
[4006.1s] The
[4007.5s] the crypto economics conference was great, but kinda crazy .
[4007.5s] Like, there was a guy whose name is escaping me in these, like, smart guy, very tight bike shorts,
[4018.2s] and he kept, like, raising his hand and, you know, I I think he had, like, a defense background.
[4024.6s] I'm
[4026.0s] trying to IBM had a big speaking slot .
[4026.0s] At the time, they were
[4031.2s] they were promoting Ethereum plus some other technologies as, like, the key to their IoT stack.
[4037.9s] I'm

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4039.5s] trying to even remember who all Okay .
[4039.5s] I I actually looked this up .
[4039.5s] So the the participants
[4044.9s] like, it was a very small group of people, like, I think twenty, twenty five.
[4049.3s] But in the among that group of people
[4052.2s] was
[4053.7s] so, yeah, Vlad who did proof of stake was there.
[4057.4s] Vitalik was there .
[4057.4s] You know, Gavin was there who was working on Ethereum but later went on to do Polkadot .
[4057.4s] Dominic who went to do, you know, Internet was there .
[4057.4s] Yeah .
[4057.4s] I think Jake Jake Kwan .
[4057.4s] Jake Kwan was there.
[4071.3s] You know, went off to do Cosmos.
[4073.8s] Like, a bunch of Bitcoin core devs were there.
[4077.6s] Mhmm .
[4077.6s] You know, it was it was just a crazy
[4080.9s] group of people to be like .
[4080.9s] I don't like, if you looked at the amount of talent, like, I know people are talking about the PayPal mafia .
[4080.9s] That was like the crypto mafia .
[4080.9s] Right ?
[4080.9s] Like, it was like everyone
[4091.9s] who went off, you know, almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project.
[4097.9s] And but
[4099.5s] they were like, I remember being in that room and kind of like, we'd started talking, and I was really starting on my journey about learning about Ethereum,
[4109.2s] and I was just completely baffled .
[4109.2s] Like, I spent probably 90% of my time on Wikipedia, like, trying to figure out, like, what does the Byzantine general's problem have to do with technology?
[4121.2s] Why
[4122.8s] are they talking about this ?
[4122.8s] You know, like, or, you know, like snarks .
[4122.8s] What are snarks ?
[4122.8s] Like, you know, I remember, like, trying
[4130.3s] to madly keep up with these things, but it was just being in that room was exciting .
[4130.3s] Like, you could it was the first time
[4138.7s] that I ever totally clicked in that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform.
[4145.4s] And that, like, you know, because
[4148.3s] it always got overshadowed by the financial money crypto aspect of it, right ?
[4148.3s] But you could in that room, it was very different .
[4148.3s] It was just like everyone was really focused on like, okay, how do we build this world computer, right ?
[4148.3s] So like
[4162.1s] and, yeah, like, I I mean, the talent level was off the chart in that room .
[4162.1s] Like, it's just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4168.4s] Yeah.
[4170.3s] Vicky should tell the Robin Hanson story.
[4173.9s] So For for the for context of the the listener, if we forget any,
[4179.6s] Robin Hanson is a really smart guy, kind of famous sort of quite technical economist .
[4179.6s] I think it's George Mason or or something like that .
[4179.6s] Good Twitter follow-up too .
[4179.6s] You should you should follow him.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4191.4s] Well, he he invented prediction markets, basically .
[4191.4s] He yeah .
[4191.4s] Pretty much .
[4191.4s] Yeah .
[4191.4s] He's the father prediction markets .
[4191.4s] So, you know, and to be clear, Robin Hanson is way smarter than I'll ever be .
[4191.4s] But, like so I was in that conference madly,
[4205.5s] you know, in Wikipedia
[4206.9s] for the for the three days ahead of O'Reilly.
[4209.8s] He was We ourselves were all pretty new to to blockchain .
[4209.8s] So yeah .
[4209.8s] We That's true .
[4209.8s] But, like and, like, you know, it was and people were, like,
[4218.1s] going really, really deep into these conceptual things.
[4221.5s] And, like
[4223.2s] so but after those three days was the O'Reilly conference.
[4227.9s] And at one point in the O'Reilly conference, they had, like, sort of, like, a lunch where everyone sat around these big tables and kind of a networking part of it .
[4227.9s] And I remember Robin was like one of the
[4240.6s] panelists on some panel about blockchain.
[4243.5s] And
[4244.8s] he was asking me like, oh, you know, what do I do and what what was I here for ?
[4244.8s] And we had a conversation, and I just kind of summarized
[4253.1s] a few things that I'd learned over the past three days.
[4256.8s] And so we we had this conversation, and I said, you know, it's not really about money .
[4256.8s] It's about, you know, building this world computer and all these things.
[4263.9s] And he basically got on stage and reiterated
[4267.8s] a bunch of things I told him during lunch .
[4267.8s] And everyone was like, how did Robin become a blockchain expert ?
[4267.8s] Like, he's really on the cutting edge of where this technology is .
[4267.8s] You know?
[4279.0s] But it it was just amazing .
[4279.0s] You know?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4284.0s] Yes .
[4284.0s] Yeah.
[4286.5s] It was yeah .
[4286.5s] It was quite a room of people.
[4289.8s] We had some other we had so Robin's also a bit of a futurist .
[4289.8s] We had another kind of, quote, futurist guy named Steve Omahendro.
[4297.0s] I don't know how to pronounce it .
[4297.0s] He's a super smart guy, as well, and I've not really spoken to him in long time.
[4303.1s] But it was
[4304.4s] I think there was this, you know, an energy in the air that was
[4309.1s] quite palpable.
[4310.9s] And so it kind of
[4312.9s] I don't know .
[4312.9s] Did this it it was a a big thing that convinced us to start our company, I would say .
[4312.9s] And maybe not yeah .
[4312.9s] I think the thing that kind of convinced us was,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4323.9s] like, it was like being in two rooms .
[4323.9s] Right ?
[4323.9s] There was Cryptonomicon where it was like everyone
[4328.7s] was talking about this new kind of computing platform and all the things it could do .
[4328.7s] And then there were the Rusty Riley conference where you had a bunch of big bankers, you know, like Reed Hoffman was there and people, and they were talking about money.
[4341.6s] Like, this was about money .
[4341.6s] And and, like, it was clear that they didn't know what was really going on in the other room .
[4341.6s] Like, that you know, something much, much bigger was happening.
[4353.9s] And I think that convinced us as, oh, we could build a bridge between these two worlds.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4359.6s] Yeah .
[4359.6s] Yeah .
[4359.6s] I I remember that distinctly.
[4362.5s] And it was yeah .
[4362.5s] This is funny time.
[4365.4s] The big headliners at the O'Reilly conference, Reed Hoffman.
[4370.9s] Think spoke.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4372.7s] Yeah .
[4372.7s] Yeah .
[4372.7s] Something like that .
[4372.7s] Bill Janeway,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4375.8s] I believe,
[4376.7s] you know, and and, you know, some others.
[4380.9s] Okay .
[4380.9s] I wanna shift gears to the
[4383.9s] client race,
[4386.6s] which we've hit on.
[4388.3s] But at this point, I I got really into it .
[4388.3s] So I was never
[4392.3s] I was I I learned in school enough how to program software,
[4396.3s] but was not a, you know, professional quality software developer, and I kind of learned enough
[4402.2s] of that quickly on the job with Jim .
[4402.2s] So as Jim alluded to, we would meet up at my Berkeley apartment.
[4409.0s] I think
[4410.8s] first, we were meeting at
[4414.8s] one on, I'm gonna say, Telegraph just north of Ashby.
[4419.1s] Yeah .
[4419.1s] Just on the right by the Oakland border .
[4419.1s] And then later, we we met at a a different one .
[4419.1s] Right ?
[4419.1s] Campus .
[4419.1s] Very close to campus .
[4419.1s] Yeah .
[4419.1s] Like Bancroft and Telegraph.
[4429.0s] And, you know, so
[4431.1s] it was an open source project.
[4434.6s] And
[4436.8s] there was because lots of people were making their own versions of it, there was sort of a, like I said, a fight for the definition of it, which is in the end settled by the yellow paper.
[4447.0s] But,
[4448.5s] you know, I can you talk a little bit about that time where we're just coding really hard,
[4454.9s] you you and I, and just, like, trying to keep pace with the the spec,
[4460.5s] etcetera?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4462.2s] Well, yeah .
[4462.2s] I mean, the it was fun and frustrating at the same time because,
[4469.2s] I think that the Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there,
[4474.8s] but still things were changing faster than, like, the yellow paper could could keep up to things.
[4479.7s] So I would just,
[4481.5s] like, have something to the point where it was connecting and communicating
[4485.9s] and running running the virtual machine .
[4485.9s] And then, like,
[4489.7s] next day, I'd come in and completely wouldn't work .
[4489.7s] And
[4493.6s] maybe maybe a few weeks later, like, the the yellow paper would be updated to explain why .
[4493.6s] But in the meantime, the only way that I could sort of figure stuff out was to just go and get one of the other clients and read how in the world are they getting this thing to work .
[4493.6s] And then there was one point when they added encryption to the connect to the connection that essentially changed
[4510.8s] the protocol completely .
[4510.8s] I connected,
[4513.4s] was working anymore.
[4515.2s] I had to, like, just dig in and yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4518.2s] That was Actually, you you had just repressed that memory.
[4521.9s] The
[4522.9s] so mostly,
[4524.1s] Jim figured all of this out, but they so the Ethereum people put, just for the technical audience, kind of the equivalent of something like SSL
[4533.5s] into the product.
[4535.9s] So in they
[4537.9s] you know ?
[4537.9s] Yeah .
[4537.9s] And they put end to end encryption in, and this is a complex, like, handshake, and then, like, a session was created between peers and yada yada .
[4537.9s] And so
[4548.1s] it's really hard to implement
[4550.2s] stuff like that because all of the the mess you're getting back is encrypted .
[4550.2s] So you have to get it totally perfect, and then it makes sense .
[4550.2s] But if you don't get it perfect, nothing makes sense, and you don't know why.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4561.6s] I was just irrationally angry about it .
[4561.6s] Like, I was like, I I didn't care whether this was good or or bad for the for the product .
[4561.6s] I was like, why ?
[4561.6s] But I was actually genuinely confused too because you have, like, this open network
[4573.5s] that anyone can connect to, but you wanna encrypt everything that's going on it .
[4573.5s] It took me a while to figure out why that actually happened .
[4573.5s] I I was asking around
[4581.1s] in various, like,
[4584.0s] DM services .
[4584.0s] I don't remember where where I used to go and talk to people.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4588.3s] I found There were the giants
[4590.4s] Skype threads, I remember at the time .
[4590.4s] Oh, lord .
[4590.4s] There was, like, huge
[4595.4s] like, we this was, like I think we weren't even using Slack yet .
[4595.4s] It was, like, there was tons of Skype .
[4595.4s] Slack was just getting popular at this time .
[4595.4s] Ethereum had a Slack.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4605.4s] ConsenSys had a Slack .
[4605.4s] We can get into the consensus story a little bit.
[4610.6s] And
[4612.2s] the
[4613.1s] but, yeah, we had a Skype thread
[4615.7s] for some reason, you know, like, just because it was the thing that people used for a threaded discussion group .
[4615.7s] I think WhatsApp maybe wasn't popular or Yeah .
[4615.7s] Not for this purpose .
[4615.7s] You know ?
[4615.7s] So

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4625.7s] we spent a month It's dug around a while .
[4625.7s] I dug around a while to figure out why in the world encryption had even been added to this .
[4625.7s] And I I would kept getting sort of like, oh, we wanna make sure that this, information is private .
[4625.7s] And I was like, it doesn't make sense .
[4625.7s] I can connect anywhere and and see this stuff .
[4625.7s] Finally found one of the people that had implemented it, and the the idea wasn't crazy.
[4645.8s] It had nothing to do with I mean, guess it had something to do with encryption,
[4650.0s] but but their thought process is that it was more about identity .
[4650.0s] They wanted, if once you join, you wanted to have essentially, like, a cert that verified that you are who you say you are, and they wanted that there for,
[4661.5s] the various, extensions that they were putting in .
[4661.5s] And so
[4665.3s] okay .
[4665.3s] That that that wasn't crazy .
[4665.3s] It was very annoying to me to spend a week of my life trying to influence .
[4665.3s] But the other thing that's kind of funny is that
[4675.6s] and I maybe, Karen, you know more from talking to people over the summer, but there was sort of a distrust
[4681.8s] in standards.
[4684.3s] And so, like, I think, like, the thing that usual software engineer would do is be to actually get SSL
[4692.0s] and implement it with that,
[4694.4s] or or to take, like like, I don't know, hash algorithms that were,
[4701.1s] that had, like, a corporate stamp of approval and put that in .
[4701.1s] But they always wanted to sort of, like, put things a little bit outside of there because I think they feared maybe truthfully of, backdoors and all of these things .
[4701.1s] And so I essentially
[4714.8s] had to go and get a lot of nonstandard
[4720.3s] encryption algorithms and and paste them together into an SSL like thing.
[4725.6s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4726.5s] Yeah .
[4726.5s] I I can add a little bit on that .
[4726.5s] I would say the building blocks were at least semi standard.
[4733.2s] They they use the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin for the actual, you know, signatures and transfer from the money and and all that .
[4733.2s] The
[4742.7s] algorithms that went into the reinvention of SSL,
[4747.1s] like, I think the building blocks were just normal stuff .
[4747.1s] They didn't invent hashing algorithms or signing algorithms and and all that sort of thing .
[4747.1s] But the composition is something you have to be quite careful about .
[4747.1s] They weren't they weren't just inventing encryption.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4759.7s] So they were taking things that were were
[4762.9s] approved of, but they weren't taking things that were the standards.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4766.3s] Exactly .
[4766.3s] That's right .
[4766.3s] And I think it did have to do a little bit with backdoor fear.
[4771.7s] But, also, I remember a comment one time, like, you know, TCP
[4776.7s] has never been proven to be able to be the backbone of a peer to peer network .
[4776.7s] And there was some, like like, I think BitTorrent,
[4785.5s] you know, maybe it use UDP or something and plus something proprietary on top or something .
[4785.5s] There was the belief that the
[4794.0s] existing protocols were insufficient,
[4797.2s] and it might be right .
[4797.2s] It also might be just like
[4801.2s] going back to the point, like, had a lot of money at this point .
[4801.2s] Like, they wanted to rebuild everything.
[4806.8s] So I think it's probably some mix of of those those things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4812.0s] I mean, for instance, the hashing algorithm that they chose to use in the early days was
[4818.1s] they were calling it SHA three.
[4820.6s] And
[4822.0s] but SHA three hadn't been finalized at that point in time, so they were sort of, like, taking the proposal.
[4827.5s] And and so
[4829.7s] I I I went and got the
[4833.6s] codes in the Haskell
[4835.9s] code base that did shot the the proposed shot three at that point in time.
[4840.8s] And then one day, I kind of, like, went into the, I think, like, the c plus plus client and looked around, and they started calling it Ketchik .
[4840.8s] And I was like, what ?
[4840.8s] What what what's going on here ?
[4840.8s] Why did they change the algorithm ?
[4840.8s] But it was still connecting to what I had there .
[4840.8s] So
[4855.3s] I was a little bit confused, and I found out later what had happened was
[4860.4s] there had been a last minute change in SHA three,
[4864.3s] and the Ethereum
[4865.5s] team, felt that this was a government backdoor that was being put in there, and they refused to put that change in .
[4865.5s] And so they stuck with the original proposal, which was called Ketchik,
[4876.3s] which is something that I had already implemented there.
[4880.1s] But but they aren't technically SHA three anymore .
[4880.1s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4884.7s] Gotcha.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4885.8s] Yeah .
[4885.8s] Okay .
[4885.8s] I have a vague memory of that .
[4885.8s] Saying it was a government vector .
[4885.8s] I don't know one or the other, but that was their belief.
[4891.4s] Can

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4894.6s] you
[4895.4s] talk a little bit about okay.
[4897.7s] You're talking to Roman some at this time.
[4901.3s] Who's Roman ?
[4901.3s] You know ?
[4901.3s] What was going on ?
[4901.3s] I also remember,
[4905.9s] like, the issue of sync,
[4908.8s] and I I wanna you to say it, but I'll prompt you if if need be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4914.3s] Oh, this well, I remember I remember sync speed was okay .
[4914.3s] So That's a yeah .
[4914.3s] Yeah.
[4920.6s] You know, there were there were kinda like two tiers of
[4923.8s] of
[4924.8s] software
[4927.0s] developers in the original sort of test net .
[4927.0s] There were, like, those who were around from the beginning that I was not in that group, You know, again, driving around country.
[4938.8s] But
[4940.0s] so
[4941.4s] and then and that included,
[4943.4s] I I guess, Python, which was VitalX,
[4946.6s] c plus plus, and and Geth
[4949.0s] were were first year .
[4949.0s] Was there another first year ?
[4949.0s] I'm trying to remember.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[4953.5s] I think those were the three, like,
[4957.0s] foundation
[4958.2s] less sponsored ones .
[4958.2s] J

**SPEAKER_02:**
[4961.2s] in the original group,
[4963.2s] but then it got kind of

**SPEAKER_01:**
[4965.7s] Pulled out perhaps ?
[4965.7s] Pulled out .
[4965.7s] Yeah .
[4965.7s] Because I Okay .
[4965.7s] I I think I may he Roman might have worked for the foundation for a And then yeah .
[4965.7s] Gotcha .
[4965.7s] I think he started a little bit serious to me because I first thought he was part of the foundation, but then I found out later he had been someone who came in a little bit later.
[4983.3s] And then maybe there were some I don't know .
[4983.3s] Again, maybe you know more than I do, Karen, but there was some, maybe, some arguing there or something, and so they weren't really communicating with him as much.
[4993.2s] Don't know if I got that right .
[4993.2s] But,
[4996.0s] but so, yeah, so that was the so Roman,
[4999.1s] was the Java client .
[4999.1s] What was Roman's last name?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5002.9s] Mandelay
[5004.1s] Mandelayl.
[5004.9s] I don't know how to pronounce it .
[5004.9s] M a n d e l
[5009.1s] e I l .
[5009.1s] Some something like that .
[5009.1s] You know ?
[5009.1s] You can look at It was Roman who did Java.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5015.3s] Gavin was doing c plus plus, and Jeff was doing Go, I think .
[5015.3s] And then we talked about Python .
[5015.3s] But Roman and I were the later guys .
[5015.3s] So and I did the Haskell client .
[5015.3s] And and Roman

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5025.3s] may or may not have been in the Ethereum Foundation .
[5025.3s] I was not in the Ethereum Foundation, but I, you know, I met I met with those guys a number of times.
[5034.1s] And
[5036.2s] but the thing that everybody,
[5038.6s] I guess what you were alluding to, I'm not sure what precisely,
[5041.8s] the story is looking for, but but it was sync speed was the thing that everybody would commit compete against .
[5041.8s] And I remember, like, going to various meetups, and Roman would always kinda run up to me, and he's like, I how how long does it take you to, sync up to a million blocks in
[5055.9s] in the test net now ?
[5055.9s] And so there was always, like, this competitiveness around around sync speed,
[5061.1s] which is is an important thing, but but, you know, there are other things too .
[5061.1s] So and so everybody was just rushing to to get sync speed faster and faster at that point in time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5071.1s] So I the thing I wanted to capture is, like, in in some ways, one that seemed like a little juvenile at the time, but it was also genius.
[5079.3s] Like, you got a lot of technical energy all focused around this one thing, Ethereum .
[5079.3s] Like, these people probably could have, like, tried to make their own Ethereum like blockchain or Bitcoin like blockchain or all that sort of thing .
[5079.3s] But, you know, it was sort of open source, made the best, get merged sort of, you know, attitude,
[5098.4s] and
[5099.3s] that it probably made for a better product at the end of the day.
[5104.4s] That was that was kind of the the main point that, like yeah .
[5104.4s] It was it it felt like, you know, nerdy kids playing with things .
[5104.4s] But, like, it kinda works .
[5104.4s] You know?
[5116.2s] Also remember, like, they, you know, they flooded the test nets with, like, giant blocks of data at some point .
[5116.2s] You know, there was a lot of I felt like
[5127.4s] the you know, people were treating it like this is like a spacecraft launch .
[5127.4s] Like, you had to, like, really stress test it
[5135.3s] because of, you know, gonna be the new world computer.
[5139.4s] And so
[5140.5s] in some ways, while the the development was far more incremental
[5144.0s] and than, like, a Bitcoin, there was still very stringent and perhaps unrealistic scenario testing that was going on before the launch.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5154.8s] Well, and I I think that's one thing that's kind of interesting about it also is that it was very meritocratic.
[5161.4s] Right ?
[5161.4s] And and and, like, there was all this competition going on, but even though, like,
[5167.3s] you know, Gavin was technically CTO and and, you know, Vitalik is obvious Vitalik, but, like, they
[5173.3s] didn't win .
[5173.3s] Like, the one that won was Jeff's Go client .
[5173.3s] The Go client .
[5173.3s] Right ?
[5173.3s] Like and you could imagine in any other scenario, they could have just put their foot down and said, no .
[5173.3s] We're gonna go with Python or no .
[5173.3s] We're gonna go with C plus plus But they went with the one that actually performed the best and was doing the best.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5191.6s] It it was a surprise to me .
[5191.6s] I was always treating C plus plus as the reference client.
[5197.0s] And
[5198.0s] Gavin was sort of more of a spokesman over there at the time .
[5198.0s] Jeff was sort of quieter.
[5204.9s] And
[5207.7s] at the last minute,
[5210.0s] I think there was some discussion about they needed to go through a security audit.
[5215.4s] And I might the story I heard, I don't know if it's true or not, is that they chose to do Geth first thinking that the, you know, c plus plus would be the last thing, and and they would put that out there.
[5225.5s] But, he kinda quietly went through that .
[5225.5s] And,
[5229.7s] I honestly like, I don't know .
[5229.7s] Maybe I'll I'll step on toes saying this .
[5229.7s] But, like, from using all of these clients, the Geth was the most stable at the time .
[5229.7s] I would always like, I would start it, and I would run .
[5229.7s] C plus plus was changing a lot, and so often I would start it and, oh, it's not working today.
[5244.5s] I think that plus the security audit pushed it over, and people
[5248.0s] use that one a lot .
[5248.0s] So

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5251.4s] Yeah .
[5251.4s] Yeah .
[5251.4s] I I have a similar memory.
[5255.7s] And, of course, Gavin went on later to create parody,
[5258.8s] the Rust version, which I I think got pretty popular .
[5258.8s] I'm not quite sure where what it's where it stands today.
[5267.2s] So
[5269.3s] the
[5270.3s] talking about security, I wanna hone in on the theme of the shifting launch date .
[5270.3s] Jim, do you remember
[5277.2s] our Victor too ?
[5277.2s] You know, we we had started to work on kind of a company related to all this, and we're getting worried
[5284.7s] because they kept adding more stuff,
[5287.8s] basically.
[5289.8s] Do you wanna can you kinda go into our you know, anything you remember from that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5295.4s] It would've continued except for a bit of unlock that in a way was lucky,
[5301.4s] is what ended up happening is Bitcoin crashed at that time.
[5306.2s] And it really put the fire under everybody's feet that they had to get this thing out immediately
[5311.1s] because
[5312.2s] the their holdings weren't in Bitcoin.
[5314.8s] And so I think if that hadn't happened, there wouldn't have been the pressure to push it out right then and there, and they might have just kept adding and modifying
[5323.0s] indefinitely after that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5326.0s] So I believe the foundation was paying people
[5330.2s] sort of denominated in fiat currency,
[5333.5s] but with Bitcoin.
[5334.8s] So, you know, if it's x number of thousand euro or USD per month, they would the the Bitcoin amount would vary.
[5343.5s] And, yes, to that end,
[5345.8s] they everyone I remember in that room at Zoom,
[5349.4s] you know, there was discussion of, like, well, what if Bitcoin goes to 10,000 ?
[5349.4s] Because that would be really high at that time .
[5349.4s] Like, we shouldn't convert it .
[5349.4s] And they ended up being right.
[5359.4s] You know, I think the the prudent move
[5362.0s] would have been
[5365.1s] at least some diversification in the trash in the treasury .
[5365.1s] I believe they kept it all in Bitcoin
[5371.8s] and paid it out, I think, in Bitcoin .
[5371.8s] But, again, you know, the the amount would vary .
[5371.8s] And, of course, some bills
[5378.4s] just had to be in euro or whatever, the the Swiss francs, if that's a or
[5385.0s] USD.
[5386.1s] And so there was no avoiding the fact that runway was shrinking
[5390.0s] from, you know, having brought in the roughly 22,000,000
[5394.4s] ramping up big dev teams, lot of redundancy.
[5397.3s] So I think three full dev teams
[5400.6s] for the clients, maybe a half a dev team for Python because it was kind of just Metallic working out how it all works .
[5400.6s] It was not gonna be as fast as the others because it was in Python.
[5411.2s] Then there was I think they started paying the JavaScript people later.
[5415.2s] There's development of the Mist browser .
[5415.2s] There's, you know, the the libraries and tooling started getting going .
[5415.2s] They were they were doing a lot .
[5415.2s] And, you know, almost all of it was technical.
[5427.9s] Not too much had, like, a business development,
[5430.8s] you know, focus.
[5432.5s] And,
[5433.5s] yeah, then the the price drops, and suddenly,
[5436.4s] what had gone I believe they had forecast a 2016
[5440.4s] launch timeline,
[5442.6s] and it got moved up to maybe July
[5444.9s] 2015.
[5446.0s] So we're sitting there, you know, in in March .
[5446.0s] We're like, oh, you're telling us the thing is gonna launch in 2016.
[5451.8s] Like, should we be doing this ?
[5451.8s] And then it moves up .
[5451.8s] And
[5456.1s] it was great that it moved up.
[5459.0s] Jim, do you recall
[5460.7s] how do you remember how you predicted roughly when it would launch?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5465.6s] No .
[5465.6s] I'm not sure what you're referring to.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5468.8s] I
[5470.3s] think
[5471.3s] you plotted
[5472.5s] a commit graph
[5474.3s] where, like it was, like, commits by day in the Ethereum repo .
[5474.3s] I remember best.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5480.0s] Don't remember this, but okay .
[5480.0s] I don't doubt I did it .
[5480.0s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5483.8s] And so, like, they the July date called a couple was after the deadline had been moved a couple times .
[5483.8s] So, basically, they're running out of money .
[5483.8s] They moved the the deadline the the launch date way up .
[5483.8s] Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5496.2s] And and they move it to, Spain .
[5496.2s] But I remember thinking very heavily about how it had been changing very quickly, and then it slowed down, and I was happy .
[5496.2s] Yeah .
[5496.2s] And I I will say they that 2016

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5508.4s] date happened after a series of changing dates because we're like, hey .
[5508.4s] You know, we wanna launch this company, but we need you know, we were still connected to the, hopefully, the live net at the time .
[5508.4s] And so we were, like, trying to time our thing, and they were, like, changing dates all the time too .
[5508.4s] And so I think the 2016 date was, like, the sort of last one before they kind of changed their mind and re refocused.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5533.0s] There were many eras
[5534.8s] which everyone has copied since .
[5534.8s] There's like this is the
[5539.2s] what were all the names ?
[5539.2s] The serenity after it launched .
[5539.2s] There's, like, metropolis .
[5539.2s] Serenity.
[5543.8s] Serenity .
[5543.8s] Yeah .
[5543.8s] You know?
[5546.7s] They were, like, epochs
[5548.4s] where, like, there'd be testing of the software,
[5551.8s] and they they intended to stay in test net for quite a long time .
[5551.8s] That's the upshot .
[5551.8s] And I think they ended up, like, crediting some of the test net mined ether, like, one to 10 again or 10 to one against
[5563.8s] real ethereum to 10% of the value
[5566.4s] for the people who mined on the test net .
[5566.4s] So they made it kinda progressively more real,
[5570.8s] but it
[5571.8s] it really was fortuitous that there was a price crash because we we might never have seen it might have never seen the light of day .
[5571.8s] So many of the And I I I think you you didn't even elucidate,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5581.1s] like, all of the projects .
[5581.1s] Like, there was a Raspberry Pi client that had I forgot about the Raspberry Pi client .
[5581.1s] There were, like, so many projects .
[5581.1s] Like, it was, like we were, what is going on here ?
[5581.1s] You know ?
[5581.1s] Like

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5595.3s] They built
[5596.5s] you know ?
[5596.5s] Okay .
[5596.5s] So there were many different I I think I said,
[5600.5s] there was Serpent, which was the Python like language that compiled to EVM.
[5606.0s] There's Solidity, which won.
[5608.2s] So, you know, go sorry .
[5608.2s] C plus plus lost, but Solidity won .
[5608.2s] Yeah .
[5608.2s] And Solidity was kinda put together by Gavin .
[5608.2s] It's sort of a c JavaScript
[5618.8s] looking language.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5620.4s] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5622.3s] There was another one .
[5622.3s] L l l .
[5622.3s] L
[5625.6s] l .
[5625.6s] L l .
[5625.6s] It's like a list Yeah .
[5625.6s] Like

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5627.8s] It was like list like I did.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5629.6s] To some extent, it it let the developers just be free to do things that developers always wanna do, like build peer to peer messaging systems, write compilers .
[5629.6s] You know ?
[5629.6s] Yeah .
[5629.6s] It was like new DSL .
[5629.6s] Works .
[5629.6s] Exactly.
[5641.5s] Yeah.
[5643.8s] Yeah .
[5643.8s] No .
[5643.8s] That was that was funny .
[5643.8s] Okay .
[5643.8s] Let's go to,
[5648.1s] because we can, get close to wrapping up here .
[5648.1s] And, you know, if, if there's interest, we could do another one of these, because there's lots after the launch .
[5648.1s] Let's go to kinda right before
[5658.9s] the launch .
[5658.9s] Okay .
[5658.9s] So
[5662.1s] as we're talking about the the launch run up,
[5665.3s] a bunch of interesting things happened .
[5665.3s] One, we had started to some extent working as part of consensus.
[5672.2s] Yeah.
[5673.0s] So we kind of joined the company, and it you know, they function sort of as an incubator,
[5679.3s] basically, us,
[5681.2s] and and plenty of other,
[5683.7s] firms, concepts, some of which stayed in house, some of which also, spun out.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5689.5s] Brooklyn was awesome too .
[5689.5s] I I'd never been to,
[5692.7s] Williamsburg or Bushwick, and and it was sort of moving in various locations there .
[5692.7s] So I was I used to love coming and hanging out at the offices.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5700.9s] Yeah .
[5700.9s] It was ConsenSys got the the famous office on Bogart, but first was at an office by the water in Williamsburg.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5709.4s] Was, like, something It was in Greenport .
[5709.4s] I remember getting completely lost
[5714.3s] at one point and finding it and, like

**SPEAKER_01:**
[5717.5s] Yeah .
[5717.5s] Will Williamsburg is great .
[5717.5s] I remember I remember, like, sitting there one day, and all of a sudden, everybody came screaming in, and and they were filming an episode of girls outside .
[5717.5s] And so I ran outside and watched them film an episode of girls or part of an episode of girls, not the whole episode .
[5717.5s] No .
[5717.5s] Wow.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5733.6s] Yeah .
[5733.6s] That was so okay .
[5733.6s] So that's

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5736.5s] early .
[5736.5s] Was it at March, April ?
[5736.5s] That was around yeah .
[5736.5s] I think it was April, May kind of thing .
[5736.5s] Well, we moved into the Bogart office
[5747.5s] just before the launch of Ethereum .
[5747.5s] In fact, we we one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5758.1s] Right .
[5758.1s] Right .
[5758.1s] Okay .
[5758.1s] Yeah .
[5758.1s] I do remember that.
[5762.2s] So, you know, so we're frantically building the software.
[5766.7s] We're starting to work with people from within
[5770.3s] consensus.
[5771.7s] So we had some folks,
[5774.8s] you know, join the project, some of whom have gone on to, you know, big blockchain success.
[5780.7s] Should should we tell the the Tim story?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5783.1s] Well, yeah .
[5783.1s] I mean, Tim, the founder of
[5786.8s] truffle, helped us kind of build
[5789.2s] our first blockchain explorer.
[5791.6s] You know ?
[5791.6s] I mean, he was a brilliant developer back then and still remains a brilliant developer.
[5797.0s] Aaron, I think helped us kind of he who went on to build MetaMask.
[5802.8s] You know, we had lots of conversations with him about how to
[5807.1s] create our REST API and how it would work.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5810.8s] I met up a couple times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also, it was funny, like these folks would just come by and now they're like sort of different levels of a big deal .
[5810.8s] Exactly.
[5821.8s] I feel like you should tell the hard hitting version of the tips story just so, you know, a little bit because it was funny in retrospect .
[5821.8s] Right ?
[5821.8s] Well, I I think the thing is that we were really focused on at the time,

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5834.6s] I think the first idea that we had with block apps was that we would create, like, a REST API,
[5841.5s] And
[5843.0s] we
[5844.8s] you know, I I come from sort of a lean startup background .
[5844.8s] Like, we really want to push deadlines.
[5850.3s] And at the time, people were more in an exploration mode .
[5850.3s] They were trying to do different things .
[5850.3s] And I was kind of ratcheting up the pressure
[5858.9s] to kind of present this at some I don't know if it was a conference or some meetup in a particular night.
[5866.2s] And,
[5867.0s] you know, as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that, people were like, you know, I think I wanna kind of pursue my other interests
[5875.6s] instead of, like, working in this high pressure environment.
[5879.3s] And, you know, like
[5881.1s] a lot of early consensus was like that .
[5881.1s] Like, it was like different working styles and different methodologies.
[5887.2s] But in the end, it was kind of amazing, like, you know, the the people who did stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5892.5s] Yeah .
[5892.5s] I would say
[5893.9s] lots of really smart people
[5897.0s] and
[5898.0s] a lot of flow between projects .
[5898.0s] It was amorphous at the beginning.
[5902.9s] Yeah .
[5902.9s] There was a lot of excitement,
[5905.4s] but it was also hard to, like, get someone who is your assigned to your team to, like, do the thing you expected.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5913.4s] Well, it doesn't mean it's that there weren't team assignments.
[5916.5s] Right ?
[5916.5s] Like, there weren't the teams
[5919.1s] I mean, we had we had They were suggested.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5922.0s] You know ?
[5922.0s] Exactly .
[5922.0s] Like

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5924.1s] and and but, you know, people were just flowing in and out, which is great for creativity,
[5929.1s] but was hard when you were trying to make a deadline because, you know, when you're trying to make a deadline, there's always sort of not
[5936.7s] great things you have to do .
[5936.7s] Right ?
[5936.7s] Like, you gotta work really long hours and that kind of stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[5942.2s] Yeah .
[5942.2s] And
[5943.6s] let me see .
[5943.6s] What I felt
[5946.5s] so we kind of we looked and saw,
[5950.2s] you know, in our early approach,
[5952.0s] some success at API companies .
[5952.0s] Like, chain.com
[5955.4s] was at the time touting a big list of customers
[5959.1s] that use their API.
[5960.7s] They then pivoted to a couple other things,
[5964.1s] more enterprise outlook, and then they kinda a little bit pivoted back and then were, you know, eventually bought by
[5970.4s] sort of bought by Stellar, I believe.
[5974.2s] So there's some precedent for, like, okay .
[5974.2s] Let's let's have an API .
[5974.2s] Let's make this really easy
[5978.8s] for people to use, and this being, you know, the Ethereum network itself.
[5982.9s] And I think we found pretty

**SPEAKER_02:**
[5985.3s] strong resistance to this idea .
[5985.3s] Oh, yeah .
[5985.3s] Do we do you wanna talk more about, you know, this stuff ?
[5985.3s] I I think while you guys were working on the client, what I was trying to do was build,
[5996.9s] you know,
[5998.1s] like,
[5999.8s] smart contract based applications.
[6001.6s] Right ?
[6001.6s] And
[6003.2s] it was really like you you described some of the tooling, right, which was missed and, like, for front ends and,
[6010.7s] you know, the languages were constantly changing .
[6010.7s] Like, a lot of this seemed to be an afterthought, like, okay, we're gonna solve that later on them, the puzzle .
[6010.7s] But it was impossible
[6021.0s] to build an application,
[6023.1s] share it around,
[6025.3s] just get something running quickly, you know, and so we like,
[6029.8s] you know, my background was like web and mobile startups and like the first thing you look for is a REST API, and I thought like, okay, if we're ever gonna get this ecosystem were to really work,
[6041.0s] we need to have something like that so people can build these applications on .
[6041.0s] You know ?
[6041.0s] We couldn't cobble together all these tools .
[6041.0s] But, yeah, we got a lot of resistance to it because, you know, people we were speaking Martian to people .
[6041.0s] Like, these are people, but they had no, like,

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6058.7s] interest in, like, anything that sounded a little bit corporate y .
[6058.7s] So

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6063.3s] Yeah .
[6063.3s] It wasn't even corporate y .
[6063.3s] It was more like
[6065.9s] like, you know, like There was a general

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6068.7s] suspicion of servers.
[6070.4s] I remember the phrase like, yeah .
[6070.4s] I don't know if I wanna work anything on anything that involves any servers.
[6077.1s] And I I
[6078.4s] remember at the time, you know,
[6080.8s] like, a peer to peer network, it's like every peer is both a client and a server .
[6080.8s] Like, you know, it's it's sort of kind of intrinsic.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6089.1s] You know ?
[6089.1s] Yeah .
[6089.1s] There was a lot of belief in the time that effectively everyone would run a node .
[6089.1s] And, like, you know,
[6097.5s] like, at some point, you'd run a node in your browser or run a node on your phone .
[6097.5s] And I'm like, look .
[6097.5s] I ran a mobile application company .
[6097.5s] Like, I know how big these clients are .
[6097.5s] Like, I don't want my Things gonna get very hot .
[6097.5s] Yeah .
[6097.5s] Exactly .
[6097.5s] Like, burning my ass, you know, sitting in my pocket trying to mine ether .
[6097.5s] Right ?
[6097.5s] So
[6117.4s] but, yeah, it was just very strange, though, these kind of conversations.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6122.2s] Yeah.
[6123.3s] And kind of concurrently,
[6125.8s] so more aligned with our perspective,
[6128.1s] consensus sort of grew an enterprise team, which focused sort of on advising big corporates on blockchain and then implementing it for them.
[6137.5s] And we kinda worked with them on go to market
[6141.1s] even before the launch of Ethereum more after .
[6141.1s] So we kinda hold on that discussion
[6147.1s] maybe for a subsequent episode.
[6150.2s] But okay .
[6150.2s] What about do you guys have any specific memories of the hackathons we did?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6156.9s] So the first hackathon we did was in Greenpoint,
[6160.5s] and
[6161.5s] we basically
[6162.8s] it was sort of internal to consensus
[6165.5s] people,
[6166.5s] and I think it was mostly interns that kind of participated.
[6170.5s] We had a very crude version of our API working,
[6174.0s] and
[6175.2s] it was really,
[6178.3s] you know, like, I think over
[6180.8s] I think over a forty eight hour period, no one could build anything, basically.
[6186.5s] Like like, it was like but
[6190.3s] I think the premise that people were coming up with to use our API to build stuff, we could see some potential in it .
[6190.3s] So, like, people are doing, you know, interesting things like incentivizing
[6200.8s] location based scavenger hunts and other kind of things .
[6200.8s] And we found that interesting enough that
[6207.7s] you know, and I think this that was in May, June
[6211.2s] 2015
[6212.4s] by that time .
[6212.4s] And then we figured out that there was, you know, a week the launch would probably happen
[6219.4s] in August of that year .
[6219.4s] And we're like, okay, let's
[6223.7s] take of all the input we got from that hackathon and do it like a real hackathon .
[6223.7s] Like, get, you know, a bunch of participants,
[6231.2s] get a bunch of people involved,
[6233.6s] and,
[6235.3s] you know, try and get all the people from consensus but people outside consensus involved.
[6239.7s] And we were kind of, like, targeting that day .
[6239.7s] So we were, like, furiously trying to make our product more stable and work and take all the input we got from that first one into the second one.
[6250.4s] When
[6251.2s] we didn't know exact I think the plan was to do it on the day of the launch of Ethereum,
[6256.2s] and but we didn't know the exact date yet .
[6256.2s] So we're just furiously You said right before or right after ?
[6256.2s] I can't remember .
[6256.2s] I I think it was right after .
[6256.2s] Yeah .
[6256.2s] I think it was, like, two days after or something like that .
[6256.2s] But, you know, it was it was in the same
[6272.7s] timing of the launch, basically .
[6272.7s] So I re you know, as far as I'm aware, that was, like, the first Ethereum hackathon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6280.2s] I remember maybe it was the second or third one we met the Crane brothers.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6284.2s] Oh, yeah .
[6284.2s] Yeah .
[6284.2s] That's right .
[6284.2s] Mhmm .
[6284.2s] They Yeah .
[6284.2s] I

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6288.2s] think that was the one right after the launch .
[6288.2s] That was, yeah, that was later.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6292.2s] That was didn't they?
[6295.2s] They didn't want the one at the launch .
[6295.2s] They want so that hackathon where we met them was actually the first
[6304.5s] consensus conference hackathon.
[6309.9s] I don't think that's true .
[6309.9s] I think that one was later .
[6309.9s] I think they Oh, no .
[6309.9s] You don't like Yeah .
[6309.9s] You're right .
[6309.9s] You're right .
[6309.9s] I think they came to the first you you're right .
[6309.9s] I think they came to that very first hackathon .
[6309.9s] Yeah .
[6309.9s] So I I think

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6321.9s] or at least John did .
[6321.9s] Well, maybe both .
[6321.9s] Yeah .
[6321.9s] Yeah .
[6321.9s] They came to the second one the first one right after the launch .
[6321.9s] Right?
[6329.5s] The yeah .
[6329.5s] This is funny .
[6329.5s] This is another foreshadowing for a future episode .
[6329.5s] But, yes, the IBM,
[6335.8s] you know, they've been circling this this whole time, and they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the consensus
[6342.8s] hackathon.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6344.9s] Like,
[6345.7s] I remember us furiously
[6347.9s] and and just the uncertainty of the launch .
[6347.9s] I was like I remember we had many, many conversations.
[6353.9s] Like, is this thing ever gonna launch ?
[6353.9s] Like, we weren't sure if it would happen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6359.3s] Yeah.
[6360.4s] Do you remember okay .
[6360.4s] Let's talk
[6362.8s] quickly about the mining
[6366.4s] that we did,
[6368.9s] and this was all for the company .
[6368.9s] You know?
[6371.8s] But
[6373.4s] do you do you recall what we we did at that time?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6378.0s] Yeah .
[6378.0s] I totally remember .
[6378.0s] So I remember well, at some point up to the launch,
[6383.6s] we realized, okay .
[6383.6s] If we were gonna help
[6387.8s] if we were gonna help businesses or other groups build applications on the Ethereum, we would need ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions.
[6397.4s] And so
[6399.4s] we're like, well, where are we gonna get this from ?
[6399.4s] And, you know, I think the first thing that happened was you guys were like, oh, we need to build a mining rig .
[6399.4s] Right ?
[6399.4s] I'll hand that over to you, Jen .
[6399.4s] I think that was

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6411.5s] Karen
[6412.5s] and I drove up to Fry's and picked up a bunch of components.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6417.6s] We did .
[6417.6s] I and, you know, we we're kinda ready for it because we I believe we had you had helped me build just, like, a workstation

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6425.9s] Yeah .
[6425.9s] I think that's right .
[6425.9s] Or two before.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6429.1s] Basically, like, the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation .
[6429.1s] So it's made a big productivity difference.
[6438.1s] Yeah .
[6438.1s] We went back,
[6440.6s] and,
[6441.5s] yeah, I I think so I moved closer to campus at that time.
[6446.0s] We took a couple different shots at mining, but what did you know, I I think
[6452.1s] mine
[6453.8s] exploded.
[6454.9s] The power supply blew up.
[6457.1s] The graphics card was actually okay.
[6460.0s] I something happened to yours .
[6460.0s] I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6462.9s] Well, we gotta go on eventually .
[6462.9s] But the part that was funny, I remember, is that we spent, like, two or three days building these machines, getting it up, putting the software on, getting it running, hitting some problems.
[6473.3s] And,
[6474.2s] it started like, ether started to dribble in at that point in time .
[6474.2s] So we're like, oh, this is awesome .
[6474.2s] And then we called up Victor, and he's like, yeah .
[6474.2s] In the last half hour, I just, like, spun up a few machines at Amazon, and I'm getting as much ether as you guys are .
[6474.2s] Well, it was more than a few machines .
[6474.2s] So, like, I remember watching you guys build this and, like, thinking, like, oh, like, this is gonna launch any day now .
[6474.2s] Right ?
[6474.2s] Like so, like, I I said, like, can someone give me an image

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6502.1s] of the Go client ?
[6502.1s] So and I took that image, and I just,
[6507.2s] like, put it on Amazon and a bunch of Spot instances.
[6510.9s] And at some point, I was, like, running,
[6513.7s] like, and I just bought as many spot instances as were available .
[6513.7s] Like, what whatever met my price I bought, and this was before, you know, mining was even known that this was something that happened .
[6513.7s] So I could still get it pretty cheap,
[6527.6s] and
[6528.4s] there weren't the blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast even if you were starting None of this is stuff you could do today .
[6528.4s] In fact, none of this is Exactly .
[6528.4s] Well, and and it stopped being effective.
[6538.9s] Like, I mean, there like, I remember at the point of the launch, I you guys were saying, yeah .
[6538.9s] We got our first ether .
[6538.9s] And I was like, do you see this graph ?
[6538.9s] Like,
[6548.5s] you know, this is the total mining power of the Ethereum network .
[6548.5s] That large wedge, which was, like, 25% is me on Spotlight.
[6556.9s] No.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6558.8s] God .
[6558.8s] We should've we should've cranked it up just, another couple weeks longer.
[6563.1s] I don't.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6564.2s] Well, I think by the time,
[6566.5s] you know, three days have passed, I'd I'd passed, like, several thousand dollars .
[6566.5s] Like, our AWS bill was, like Yeah .
[6566.5s] It seems super expensive at the time .
[6566.5s] Super expensive at the time .
[6566.5s] And, like, I was like, oh, wow .
[6566.5s] Like, this is good .
[6566.5s] But, yeah, we should I should have ran it, like, you know, a month, basically .
[6566.5s] And then
[6584.3s] it was it was pretty amazing.
[6586.3s] Because, like Yes .
[6586.3s] I I yeah .
[6586.3s] I'm not a DevOps guy, but I was, like, running hundreds of machines at a time, and it was just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6594.7s] One thing I I struggled to remember, how did they communicate
[6599.0s] that the network was ready to launch ?
[6599.0s] Is it, like,
[6603.4s] Twitter,
[6604.3s] email?
[6605.3s] Like, how did we even know ?
[6605.3s] Like, we knew we kinda knew I think it was, like, we knew from the commits that it was close .
[6605.3s] This is why I brought it up before .
[6605.3s] They're like, okay .
[6605.3s] They're slowing down .
[6605.3s] They're getting ready .
[6605.3s] You know ?
[6605.3s] But

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6616.8s] I don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty into,
[6619.9s] involved in consensus at those days, and everybody was talking about it .
[6619.9s] Yeah .
[6619.9s] And there were, like, multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining .
[6619.9s] And so
[6629.1s] there was no there was no missing it at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6631.9s] Yeah.
[6633.3s] Yeah .
[6633.3s] This is

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6634.9s] sorry .
[6634.9s] Go ahead .
[6634.9s] Sorry .
[6634.9s] Like like I said, I think there was but, like, I think they announced the date, but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not .
[6634.9s] Right ?
[6634.9s] And it turned out they did .
[6634.9s] Like, that did turn out to be the date .
[6634.9s] But, like, everyone was kind of gearing up, but we were also,
[6650.6s] like, getting ready .
[6650.6s] Like, oh, you know, it might not happen that day .
[6650.6s] It might be a couple days later .
[6650.6s] It could be a couple months later .
[6650.6s] We just weren't sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6658.3s] Yeah.
[6659.6s] Oh, man .
[6659.6s] Those
[6661.5s] those are some times for sure.
[6665.5s] Yeah .
[6665.5s] Okay .
[6665.5s] So I think this is a good wrapping point for this
[6670.1s] first episode.
[6671.4s] Hopefully, we'll see if we get any feedback from the Internet at large on whether we should keep going down this path .
[6671.4s] But,
[6679.5s] you know, quite the journey already .
[6679.5s] Lots of interesting things I've even remembered,
[6684.3s] you know, in the course of our
[6686.8s] couple hours here.
[6689.7s] Thanks, guys.
[6691.3s] Does feel like we should keep going with the story, but we'll see .
[6691.3s] You know, let's leave it as a cliffhanger, all of the excitement to come .
[6691.3s] Any final words?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[6700.6s] Well, I I I think, you know,
[6703.3s] it it's funny .
[6703.3s] Even if you look at the beginning,
[6706.5s] you see the same patterns now where there's this, like, huge amount of inflow and then, you know, up what seemed at the time, like, tons of hype, but now is, like, a trickle of hype .
[6706.5s] And and what seems like tons of capital, but now would be considered a trickle of capital .
[6706.5s] And then, like, a kind of overconfidence
[6727.4s] and then, you know, a tightening, but then,
[6730.4s] you know, real technical stuff gets done in the tightening .
[6730.4s] It's funny how that pattern has played out so many times now .
[6730.4s] Yeah .
[6730.4s] Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[6739.5s] It's a funny type of cyclical .
[6739.5s] Tell you about the time we saw Vitalik threw his shirt at someone.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[6744.1s] Oh, that's a good story .
[6744.1s] Yes .
[6744.1s] That is a really good story .
[6744.1s] The Vitalik shirt story is a good one .
[6744.1s] Alrighty.
[6749.8s] Let's let's end it here .
[6749.8s] Thanks, guys .
[6749.8s] You know, we're doing this recording on a Sunday .
[6749.8s] Hope it entertains and informs the wider world,
[6758.8s] and we'll see you next time.
